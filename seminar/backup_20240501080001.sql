The quantum\r\nextremal island method investigates the information paradox within lower-dimensional\r\nGaussâ€“Bonnet gravity, specifically focusing on a three-dimensional EGB black hole.\r\nAlso, we employ the island prescription to explore the information paradox within\r\nnon-AdS spacetime, specifically in the context of warped Anti-de Sitter black holes. We\r\nare examining eternal black holes which do not undergo evaporation. These black holes\r\nare connected to an external reservoir, facilitating the radiation reaching the boundary.\r\nThrough this process black holes can completely evaporate and disappear. The results\r\nindicate that initially, the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation exhibits a linear\r\ngrowth with time, eventually becoming unbounded later. However, when accounting for\r\nthe emergence of an island later and just beyond the event horizon, the growth in the\r\nentanglement entropy of Hawking radiation stabilizes at a constant value. This constant\r\nvalue is precisely twice the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We also examine the Page time\r\nand the Scrambling time and their dependence on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second part, we examine a quantum field propagating within a spacetime generated\r\nby a specific Z2 quotient of the BTZ black hole. We investigate how the presence of the\r\nmatter field influences the spacetime geometry, considering linear perturbations in the\r\nmetric. The exact computation of the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor is\r\nachievable by evaluating its pull-back onto the covering space. By selecting appropriate\r\nboundary conditions for the quantum field along a non-contractible cycle of the quotient\r\nmanifold, it becomes feasible to achieve a negative average energy along a null geodesic,\r\nforming a traversable wormhole.\r\n','HoD Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-03 06:19:05','Active'),(3,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\"Carbone [(L)2C(0)] Based Complexes Towards Dinitrogen Activation and Catalysisâ€','Ms. Madhuri Bhattacharya (CY21D094)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide- Dr. Kartik Chandra Mondal, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/08 15:00','2024-04-08','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','Nitrogen fixation by the reduction of N2 to NH3 is a requisite transformation for life. This can be done on a vast scale by the industrial Haberâ€“Bosch (HB) process using Mittasch catalyst at very high temperature (300ËšC) and pressure (100 bar), but in nature by nitrogenase enzymes present in certain micro-organisms under ambient conditions. Researchers have attempted to mimic nitrogenase, but due to the complex mechanism of N2 activation and inertness of N2, have met with limited success[1]. \r\nFor N2 activation, metalâ€“N Ï€-backbonding plays a crucial role. Higher the electron density on the metal, higher will be the backbonding. In this regard, carbone [(L)2C(0)] having two lone pairs of electrons, is a strong Ïƒ- and Ï€-donor ligand enhancing the electron density on the metal. Now carbodiphosphorane (CDP) is a particular type of carbone where L = phosphine. Although there are several works on expensive late transition metal and coinage metal carbone complexes[2]; early transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni) complexes, which are comparably cheaper, remain challenging to synthesis due to instability. Here I will be proposing different CDP ligands based 3d-transition metal complexes which can be implemented for N2 binding as expected from the theoretical calculations done by our group. Such strong electron donor ligands can stabilise coordinatively unsaturated metal centers, promoting catalysis[3]. In this seminar, an extensive presentation of carbodiphosphorane chemistry and itâ€™s metal complexes synthesized to date will be discussed, followed by my work done and the future perspective.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

For example, developing a new drug costs an average of 2.6 billion U.S. dollars and takes approximately a decade. Traditional computer-aided drug design methods are still ineffective due to the enormous size of the chemical space of drugs (estimated to be in the order of $10^{60}$) to be explored. Moreover, successfully designing a molecule for a particular context is just one piece of the puzzle. Once a potential lead molecule with optimized properties is generated, to realize its full therapeutic potential, a robust, economical, and sustainable pathway for synthesizing the molecule must be designed for practical application. Recent successes of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in different domains encourage us to investigate domain-specific generative and multimodal AI\'s role in solving the ``De-Novo Drug Discovery\" and ``Novel Reaction Pathway Discovery\" problems. In this presentation, we discuss our approach to addressing the prediction of drug properties, molecule generation, and synthesis pathway design, leveraging the power of AI in conjunction with domain knowledge. By harnessing various biochemical modalities such as sequences, 3D structures, and pathway networks, our method allows us to improve the pace of drug discovery and facilitates the sustainable production of a broader spectrum of compounds. We will highlight results from our work on developing chemistry-inspired interpretable representations for molecular property prediction and a de-novo molecule generation framework using Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we explore the integration of multiple biological modalities and capitalize on their synergies for synthesis pathway generation.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-04 03:44:01','Active'),(11,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Design, optimization, and experimental verification of superficial hyperthermia treatment of cancer using near-field microstrip patch antennas and ultrasound tissue thermometry.','Mr. Muthu Rattina Subash, ED19D700','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Engineering Design.','Dr.   Nilesh J Vasa (Chair)\r\n\r\nDr. Kavitha Arunachalam  (Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Arun K Thittai, AM (Co-Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Tuhin Subhra Santra,\r\n\r\nDr. M Ramasubba Reddy, AM','Department of Engineering Design','2024/04/04 15:00','2024-04-04','','ED107 ( Cybernetic Center)',' Hyperthermia is an adjuvant cancer treatment that elevates tumor temperature to 40-\r\n45 â„ƒ for 60-minute duration.

These low-dimensional materials exhibit a strong Coulomb interaction owing to reduced dielectric screening, resulting in stable excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) at room temperature [1,2]. In this work, we have studied the 2D oxide material Î±-MoO3 and its heterostructure with other TMDC materials. Our primary objective is to investigate many-body complexes, such as excitons and trions, for excitonic-based device applications. The Î±-MoO3 is a unique 2D oxide semiconductor that has recently gained immense potential in the field of optoelectronics because of its high workfunction (~6.0â€‰eV) and band gap (~3.0 eV) [3]. A large workfunction enables spontaneous electron transfer from most 2D materials to Î±-MoO3 in a heterostructure design, making Î±-MoO3 a viable candidate for designing self-driven photodetectors and hole transport layers in solar cells [3]. Our initial study was devoted to examining the charge transfer in the Î±-MoO3/MoS2 heterostructure and the subsequent formation of positive trions composed of one electron and two holes at low temperatures [4]. These trions are electrically controllable and contain information about energy, charge, and spin  [1]. In the next part of the work, we utilized H+-ion irradiation to tune the photoluminescence (PL) emission of Î±-MoO3 in a visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum  [5]. In addition, we have observed that the as-grown Î±-MoO3 crystals exhibit strong in-plane Raman anisotropy due to their low symmetric crystal structure. Furthermore, in-plane Raman anisotropy has been characterized by angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy, and the degree of anisotropy in Î±-MoO3 is quantified, which will be helpful for designing polarization-sensitive photonic devices. In the Final part of the work, we demonstrated the selective tuning of memristive characteristics of Î±-MoO3 through synthesizing two distinct single crystal types (referred to as type-I&II) using the physical vapor deposition technique.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1]	T.

Local scour around piers is a major cause of bridge failures. This research aimed to study the effect of (i) pier shape, (ii) footing geometry on local scour depth, and (iii) the flow field, turbulence, and scouring around different-shaped piers. The effect of pier shape on the scour depth is investigated using circular (M1) (diameter, D = 5 cm) and two modified pier shapes (M2 and M3), where M2 is a combination of semi-circle and triangle oriented either way (M2a and M2b), and M3 is a further modification to M2a with a small protrusion on the semi-circular end. The results showed that the scour depth for M2a, M2b, and M3 piers is reduced by 23.5%, 50%, and 55% compared to the M1. However, the scour depth increases if a skew angle is imposed. Also, tests with the piers in tandem showed that M1 as front pier and M2a as rear pier spaced at 1.0D, and M1 as rear pier and M3 as front pier spaced at 1.75D produced the least scour depths. The sensitivity analysis shows skew angle and flow velocity are the most influential parameters.\r\nBridge foundations can be exposed to flow due to long-term riverbed degradation, which affects the scour around compound piers. Experiments are conducted using a compound pier with pier diameter D and footing diameter (Df = 2D) located at different elevations. The footing at or just below the riverbed reduced the scour depths up to 57% than the pier alone, while those projecting into the flow aided scouring. Footing diameter and flow depth are the key parameters influencing scour depth prediction. Further, flow field, turbulence, and scouring around different-shaped piers are studied through 3-D velocity measurements, revealing the shielding effect of footing from the impact of downflow and horseshoe vortices in reducing scour depth around compound piers. The distribution of velocities, Reynolds shear stresses, turbulent kinetic energy, vorticity, and bed shear stresses around each pier model are studied. The developed M5 models for estimating scour depth around different-shaped piers are accurate (R2 > 0.85) than existing scour equations. This research proposes efficient pier shapes for scour reduction and contributes to safe bridge designs.','G Mathangi','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-04 12:21:03','Active'),(47,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Dynamics and control of an underwater glider','Mr.Kumar Vaibhav, Roll No: OE21S002','Mr.Kumar Vaibhav, Roll No: OE21S002, MS Scholar.','Guide: Dr. Suresh Rajendran, Department of Ocean Engineering.','OCEAN ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT','2024/04/05 16:00','2024-04-05','','Seminar Hall, Department of Ocean Engineering','The research is divided into two main sections.

To achieve path following of an underwater glider (taken as a point mass model), a virtual target method is used. The primary objective of path following is to obtain control inputs that allow the glider to converge to the desired path with high accuracy and minimum control input. To achieve this, the path following problem is first converted into an optimal control problem, and a pseudo-spectral (PS) framework is employed to solve it. Finally, the study concludes with the implementation of control inputs derived from the PS framework into a 6 DOF glider model.','OCEAN ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-05 03:30:28','Active'),(48,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','A Systematic Analysis of the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 Using Uncertainty Quantification','Hariharan R K (ch21s006)','Hariharan R K (ch21s006) MS Scholars','Guide : Dr. Himanshu Goyal','Department of Chemical Engineering','2024/04/05 17:00','2024-04-05','yes','online','\r\nA Systematic Analysis of the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 Using Uncertainty Quantification\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nElectrochemical reduction of CO2 has emerged as a promising technology to combat climate change. Despite significant advancements in catalyst materials and electrolyzer optimization, translating this progress into practical applications is challenging due to the system\'s complex multiphase and multiscale nature, particularly under industrially relevant conditions. To develop more accurate models, accounting for uncertainties in the physical system is crucial, ranging from estimating kinetic parameters to biases in transport parameters. In this study, we perform uncertainty quantification of an electrochemical cell model validated against experimental data. We explore the uncertainties associated with the input model parameters and compare them with the experimental measurements, assessing the reliability of the model predictions. Our analysis also sheds light on the contribution of different parameters to the variation in current density predictions, which can help build confidence in the model. By quantifying the biases and uncertainties in model parameters, we can develop more accurate models, which could accelerate the translation of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into practical applications.\r\n\r\n','K P GEETHA','choffice','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/nmq-khdy-avs','','',1,'2024-04-05 05:04:24','Active'),(49,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Optimization of utility-based shortfall risk: A non-asymptotic viewpoint','Mr. Sumedh Sunil Gupte, Roll No: CS21D014','Ph.D. Research Scholar','Dr. Sutanu Chakraborti - DC Chair,\r\nDr. Prashanth L A - Guide,\r\nDr. Sanjay P Bhat - Co-Guide - EE,\r\nDC Members:\r\nDr. Mitesh Khapra - CSE,\r\nDr. Harish Guruprasad - CSE,\r\nDr. Abhishek Sinha - EE.','Computer Science and Engineering','2024/04/10 11:00','2024-04-10','','A M Turing Hall (SSB 334, Second Floor)','We consider the problems of estimation and optimization of utility-based shortfall risk (UBSR), which is a popular risk measure in finance.

Next, in the context of UBSR optimization, we derive an expression for the UBSR gradient under a smooth parametrization. This expression is a ratio of expectations, both of which involve the UBSR. We use SAA for the numerator as well as denominator in the UBSR gradient expression to arrive at a biased gradient estimator. We derive non-asymptotic bounds on the estimation error, which show that our gradient estimator is asymptotically unbiased. We incorporate the aforementioned gradient estimator into a stochastic gradient (SG) algorithm for UBSR optimization.

Hydrogen is one of such alternatives; however, it will be environmentally and economically sustainable only when it is generated by using a renewable source such as solar energy. The photoelectrochemocal approach of generating hydrogen from splitting of water is an attractive option provided the photoative materials yield optimum efficiency of light absorption, photocarrier generation and reaction kinectics. In practice, no single material can achieve the desired qualities and hence the heterojunction approach has been investigated. In the proposed work, heterojunction between two metal oxide components will be fabricated in such a way that the resulting material configuration not only achieves a desired alignment of the energy bands (to help charge seperation) but also yield a high specific surface area for enhanced catalytic activity. Metal oxide nanostructures will first be fabricated using chemical techniques followed by the deposition of an overlayer with Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) technique. The basic characterization for crystallinity, microstructure, morphology, composition and optical and electronic properties will be discussed. Finally, specific investigation proposals for the heterojunction and water splitting experiments will be presented.

This is \r\nachieved through strategic utilization of transformation-induced plasticity associated with \r\nretained austenite. Hence, ensuring precise tailoring of retained austenite content, morphology \r\nand size is crucial for Q&P steels. The current research work introduces a novel processing \r\ntechnique involving a combination of hot rolling and a direct quench and partitioning \r\ntreatments to produce an ultra-high strength, low-carbon and lean-composition steel with \r\nsuperior mechanical properties and enhanced stretch flangeability. The methodology involves \r\nthe introduction of a secondary partitioning step after a one-step direct quenching and \r\npartitioning (DQP) process. A detailed investigations on microstructures, tensile properties and \r\nstretch flangeability (using hole expansion testing) were carried out. The martensite-austenite \r\ntwo phase microstructure resulted in a remarkably improved product of strength and elongation \r\n(PSE, 24 GPa.%), the hole expansion ratio of 45% and a total elongation of 21.7%. It is shown \r\nthat the stability of retained austenite, rather than its volume fraction, has a significant impact \r\non the strain hardening rate, and therefore influences strength, ductility and stretch \r\nflangeability. The results indicate that tailoring retained austenite stability is essential for \r\noptimizing the mechanical performance and stretch flangeability of quenched and partitioned \r\nsteels. Introducing secondary partitioning into the Q&P process provides a feasibility to \r\nachieve a large fraction of total retained austenite, (predominantly film-type, along with smallsized blocky retained austenite islands in the microstructure), which results in high-strength \r\nQ&P steels with excellent global and local formability.\r\nKeywords: Quenching and Partitioning Steels; Austenite; Formability; Secondary \r\nPartitioning; Stretch-flangeability','MME Office','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-05 08:21:07','Active'),(52,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Reframing Childhood: Figuration of the Child in American Independent Cinema','Mr. Arjun Anil Bhaskar.','Ph.D Research Scholar, HS20D002','Prof. Aysha Viswamohan (Guide), Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras.','HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES','2024/04/24 17:15','2024-04-24','','Online  [Google meet.google.com/qji-wbaj-efq]','This research investigates the representation of childhood in contemporary American Independent cinema and reimagines the pluralities in the portrayal as a form of resistance towards the totalizing narratives of childhood in America.

Within the American cultural imaginary, particularly mainstream Hollywood, the distinction given to childhood has become ubiquitous, creating â€˜hyperrealâ€™ idealizations of innocence, vulnerability, and dependency, with children often perceived as embryonic adults.\r\n\r\nDrawing on the theories of Baudrillard, Bourdieu, Jameson and Butler, the attempt is to deconstruct the representational strategies underpinning the depiction of the child image in select filmic texts.

Furthermore, this research aims to discern the multifaceted modalities through which Independent cinema engages with and reimagines the child subject within the evolving cultural landscape of America.

This study focuses on a divergent 2-stage supply chain encompassing a distributor and multiple retailers. Unfulfilled demands at the retailer are considered lost sales, while unmet demand is considered backordering at the distributor. The objective is to identify the optimal continuous review inventory ordering policy for a multi-period problem integrated with routing strategies, aiming to maximize the Total Supply Chain Profit (TSCP) over a finite planning horizon. This research incorporates real-world complexities in perishable products inventory management, such as demand uncertainty, price-dependent demand, markdown prices, and inventory rationing. A hybrid continuous review (s, S, $\\beta$, Q) inventory policy, commonly used in blood inventory management, is proposed for other perishable products such as fruits, vegetables, and dairy products and benchmarked against established continuous review policies, including (s, Q), (s, S), and (s, S, q, Q), all integrated with inventory routing. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid policy surpasses classical and hybrid continuous review policies regarding total supply chain profit when combined with routing and other complexities. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis explores variations in results with changing model parameters, such as time horizon, product shelf-life, demand distributions, and lead-time settings.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','MS SEMINAR-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-05 13:42:32','Active'),(55,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','When surfaces matter: how nano-scaled surface features effect macro-scale transport','Prof. Gary Rosengarten, Mechanical Engineering at RMIT, Australia','Professor Gary Rosengarten is Director of the Sustainable Technologies and Systems Enabling Impact Platform at RMIT University, and leader of the Laboratory for Innovative Fluid Thermal Systems in Mechanical Engineering.\r\n\r\nBefore deciding on an academic career, he spent 3 years at Australiaâ€™s National research laboratory, CSIRO, and 2 years as an Engineering consultant in sustainable building design.\r\n\r\nHe completed a double honours degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering at Monash University and a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the University of New South Wales.\r\n\r\nHe applies his research expertise in thermofluids and energy systems, to help solve a wide variety of problems, particularly in energy storage, solar energy, thermal control, energy efficiency, and biosystems, working closely with interdisciplinary teams from academia and industry.\r\n\r\nHe has developed solar absorbers using radiative selective surfaces and is one of the pioneers of solar spectral splitting using vo','Host Faculty: Prof. Arvind Pattamatta, ME, IITM','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/04/08 15:00','2024-04-08','yes','Hybrid Mode: MSB 211 & through Google Meet link:- https://meet.google.com/vkv-qoct-mzw','Typical heat transfer correlations or surface property data assume that surfaces are smooth or that they donâ€™t affect transport properties such as convection or radiation. \r\nHowever micro to nano-scaled features can have a massive effect on many  macroscale continuum transport properties.\r\nIn this presentation I will showcase some of our work on a simple and cheap chemical method to create superhydrophilic copper surfaces that we apply to copper foams to significantly enhance capillarity- primary for heat pipe wicks,   surface metamaterials for selective solar thermal absorbers and superhydrophobic surfaces for enhanced spray cooling heat transfer rates.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/vkv-qoct-mzw','','',1,'2024-04-08 01:33:27','Active'),(56,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Evaluating Critical Influencing Factors for Indiaâ€™s Transition to a Gas based Economy Using Multi-Agent Supply Chain Models','MR.

The \r\nAsia-Pacific region accounts for almost 65% of the global LNG demand. There was a 4.5% \r\ngrowth in global LNG consumption in 2022 compared to 2021. A substantial increase in NG \r\nconsumption is forecasted in China and India at 7% and 4%, respectively, compared to the \r\n2022-2023 levels. Further, to ensure energy security3, it is imperative to plan investments and \r\nestablish a gas supply chain (SC) infrastructure based on the forecasted end-use uptake. Thus, \r\nhere we seek to develop a systematic framework for planning gas SC infrastructure to \r\nenable large developing countries like India to plan optimal national-level supply chain \r\nnetworks for natural gas. \r\nExisting energy transition literature emphasizes the role of government policy and \r\ntechnological innovation, while little has been written to integrate â€œtop-downâ€ approaches \r\nencompassing government policy and â€œbottom-upâ€ individual enterprise-level decisions. \r\nTherefore, here we develop a hybrid top-down, bottom-up production-consumption model \r\ntowards intra-national energy transition planning using a decentralized agent-based approach, \r\nincluding a detailed geographic coverage utilizing GIS to map individual energy units. This \r\nenables the SC-level dynamics of end-users to be considered when pursuing economic \r\nobjectives subject to regulatory constraints.  \r\nThe NG supply chain comprises natural gas production sites, floating storage and \r\nregasification units (FSRUs), and LNG import and regasification terminals as the suppliers, \r\npipeline grids supplemented by virtual pipelines based on road or rail transport as \r\ninfrastructure, and end-users who use gas as fuel or feedstock as the consumers. In large \r\ncountries such as India, estimating the demand for NG would necessitate estimating the landed \r\nprice of gas for each end-user. A key component of the landed price is the supply chain cost, \r\nwith significant spatio-temporal dependence. Gas pipelines are the cheapest means to transport \r\nNG over long distances but are economically viable only for large quantities. Road and rail\r\nbased virtual pipelines have higher unit shipping costs. However, they are economically \r\nattractive for smaller demands and shorter distances. This intricate interplay between \r\n1 \r\ndemand and economics of NG makes planning the supply chain at the national level a \r\nchallenging yet critical problem for developing national policies and studying related \r\neconomics.  \r\nThe proposed methodology comprises two distinct models â€“ an agent-based \r\nProduction Consumption Model (PCM) to assess the spatially distributed demand for NG \r\nand an Infrastructure Planning Model (IPM) to estimate the logistics costs of transporting \r\ngas from the various supply nodes to the demand centers. NG suppliers (LNG regasification \r\nterminals and NG production facilities) and end-users are distributed spatially and, along with \r\nlogistic providers, are modeled as rational, self-interested decision-making entities in PCM. \r\nEach end-user agent may desire to switch to an alternate fuel at a future time, subject to \r\navailability, affordability, and national environmental regulations. Capital expenditure on \r\nbuilding pipelines is estimated through the IPM, considering factors like geographic location \r\n(e.g., presence of terrains and water bodies).  \r\nIn this work, we present the application of the integrated simulation-optimization model \r\nin estimating demand for NG from 2022 to 2042 across Pan India, along with planning the \r\nnecessary infrastructure to meet the demand. The model comprises over ~2100 spatially \r\ndistributed end-users, including large power plants, refineries, fertilizer units, petrochemicals, \r\nas well as city gas distributors across various urban centers. The spatiotemporal demand and \r\nSC infrastructure evolution of NG arising from these end-users\' decisions over the 20-year \r\nhorizon are estimated by the model for different market and policy scenarios. Our results \r\nfeaturing natural gas usage across India suggest the power and city gas sectors to be the \r\nconsistent demand drivers, with their share rising from ~40% of the total in 2022 to ~60% by \r\n2032. This is consistent with IEA and IRENA projections.  The proposed agent-based model \r\nthus provides multiple benefits: It enables the identification of key sectors driving the \r\nenergy transition; it helps analyze critical factors like resource availability, supply chain \r\ninfrastructure, and economics; and it can be used to develop decision support tools to \r\ninvestigate clean energy policies. \r\nKeywords: production-consumption model; supply chain dynamics; technology switch; clean \r\nand low carbon fuel; strategic decisions ','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/sco-xuwj-tcp','seminar08-04-2024 03:32','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar08-04-2024 03:32',1,'2024-04-08 03:32:46','Active'),(57,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','â€œSCREENING OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLASTIC WASTES TO EVALUATE RESOURCE RECOVERY POTENTIAL THROUGH ANALYTICAL PYROLYSIS','MR.

Among various anthropogenic waste materials, plastic waste has been a promising source of energy and feedstock recovery, and their conversion into valuable fuels and platform chemicals can promote sustainable management and utilization of plastic solid wastes and circular economy. Ocean debris comprises 80% of plastic waste which also can be used as a source of energy and feedstock recovery. The present study aims at collection of beach plastic wastes from the sea shore in Chennai, India, and characterizations are done to determine their composition and polymer types. The quantification of pyrolysis vapours (pyrolysates) was carried out to determine the resource and monomer recovery potential in perspectives to petrochemical industries. Moreover, the study is also focused on in-depth characterization of post-consumer multi-layered plastic packaging waste (MLPW) by various methods such as thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, bomb calorimetry, proximate and ultimate analyses. Further, based on the chemical composition of the MLPW, its non-catalytic pyrolysis and zeolite-catalysed pyrolysis was studied. The activity of various conventional zeolites is evaluated and the salient process conditions like pyrolysis temperature and feed-to-catalyst ratio are optimized for the maximum yield of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) in the pyrolysates.

In this seminar, we explore leveraging the spatial cues in sound and vision to solve two problems:  generating immersive binaural audio for videos and 360Â° depth estimation.\r\n\r\n     In the first part of the seminar, we explore the problem of generating binaural audio (two-channel) for videos, even if they only have regular monaural (single-channel) audio. These binaural videos provide a more immersive video experience for users. Such videos are more immersive, enhancing user experience. Here, we tackle a more difficult version of this problem by synthesizing binaural audio for a video with monaural audio in a weakly semi-supervised setting (in the absence of a lot of annotated data).  Our approach relies on using any downstream task that requires binaural audio as a proxy for supervision, reducing the need for explicit supervision. In this work, we use Sound Source Localization with only audio as a proxy task for weak supervision. Using this proxy task as supervision, we leverage the visual cues to understand where sounds are coming from in the scene and infuse them into audio to create a realistic 3D audio effect. \r\n\r\n    In the second part of the seminar, we explore how sound, along with RGB images, can be leveraged to improve the depth map of the scene. We experiment with echoes, which are sound reflections from the environment. Given that the echoes encode room geometry, it is possible to reconstruct the 3D room geometry, thereby depth, from echoes. We investigate how echoes, along with limited camera views, can be used to create a complete 3D depth map of a surrounding environment. This technique enables us to estimate 360Â° depth perception with limited camera views and gives spatial awareness even if we can\'t see everything around us. Our experiments demonstrate that echoes can significantly improve depth estimation accuracy, particularly for 360Â° cameras. Furthermore, the use of audio-visual information together provides a complementary approach to estimating 360Â° depth maps with limited information.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/eia-gxsb-tiu','','',1,'2024-04-08 08:21:55','Active'),(62,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Metal-organic framework and coordination polymer-based materials for supercapacitor applications','Mr. Tapan Kumar Ghosh(CY17D015)','Ph.

The framework of differential privacy renders analysis on the congregated data while ensuring that any individual\'s contribution to the dataset remains indistinguishable. Differential privacy is typically ensured by perturbation with additive noise that is sampled from a known distribution. In this talk, we will discuss an additive noise mechanism for differential privacy that adds noise sampled from a new noise density called flipped Huber distribution. It is a hybrid density that resembles Laplace in the centre and Gaussian in the tail. With a sharper centre and light, sub-Gaussian tail, this density has the best characteristics of both distributions and renders a better trade-off between privacy and accuracy than other existing mechanisms. We theoretically analyze the proposed mechanism, and we derive the necessary and sufficient condition in one dimension and a sufficient condition in high dimensions for the mechanism to guarantee (Ïµ,Î´)-differential privacy. Numerical simulations corroborate the efficacy of the proposed mechanism compared to other existing mechanisms in achieving a better trade-off between privacy and accuracy.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/nzo-uyzr-egc  ','','',1,'2024-04-10 04:12:05','Active'),(71,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Hybrid Stochastic Modelling of Daily Precipitation and Daily Streamflow','Ms. Shalini B, Roll No. CE15D041','Ph.D Scholar','Dr. R.G.

A unique feature of these ring systems is that they generally exhibit favourable structural and physicochemical properties. This characteristic made them appear to be appropriate functional group isosteres in place of other functional groups or ring systems. According to the study, replacing less desirable functional groups with azetidine and oxetane moieties can have a significant impact on PK/PD-related parameters. Introduction of a stable, small, and less lipophilic motif may lead to better fit in the receptor pockets, thereby blocking the active sites and enhancing intrinsic activity. Moreover, shielding nearby functional groups from chemical or metabolic susceptibility, without increasing lipophilicity. This study aims to explore the effect of replacing a large lipophilic substituent with a smaller, more polar group (i.e oxetane and azetidine) can improve metabolic stability and decrease the risk of adverse effects. Understanding these often drives both the lead optimisation and lead identification phases of a drug discovery program forward. In this contest virtual screening (VS) was performed on clinically approved drugs, including antineoplastic, anti-hyperglycaemic drugs, and NSAIDs, using AutoDock4 software for computer-aided drug screening. This analysis will help develop more potent drugs with better binding modes. Computational ADME prediction followed by synthesizing analogues and performing biological screening can yield promising results. Successful optimization of drug discovery programs requires identifying structural changes in leads that enhance potency. This study focuses on molecular modification as a strategy to identify new classes of lead compounds with superior pharmacotherapeutic activity, reducing the need for extensive synthetic work and increasing the likelihood of discovering more effective and safer medications.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-10 05:02:34','Active'),(75,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Static, dynamic analysis and prototype development using Aluminum 2024 alloy through additive manufacturing technology.','Mr. Saurabh Gairola, ED18D007','Ph.D. Scholar, Department of Engineering Design.

However, the additive\r\nmanufacturing of the additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy is scarce in literature due to its high\r\nsolidification cracking and low processing window. This is primarily due to the fact that the\r\ncomposition of the Al 2024 alloy is not well-suited for additive manufacturing. The high solidification\r\nrange of the Al 2024 alloy (135 K) coupled with the columnar grains formed in the additive\r\nmanufacturing due to extreme thermal gradient ( K/s) promotes solidification cracking along the grain\r\nboundaries in the additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy. The solidification cracking can be reduced\r\nby promoting the columnar to equiaxed transformation and by tailoring the composition that is better\r\nsuited for the additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy. The current study explores the Ti addition in Al\r\n2024 alloy as Ti has been conventionally used as the grain refining agent in the casting; however,\r\nstudies investigating the grain refining effect of Ti on additively manufactured Al alloy are scarce in\r\nthe literature.\r\nThe various mechanical properties such as tensile, hardness, fracture toughness, fatigue life, and\r\nfatigue crack growth behaviour were investigated for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) fabricated Ti-\r\nmodified Al 2024 alloy. The corresponding microstructural features were investigated with different\r\ncharacterisation techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron\r\nmicroscopy (TEM), electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The microstructural features such as\r\ngrain size, precipitate dislocation interaction, etc, were correlated with the mechanical properties of Ti\r\naddition in additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy. The fully equiaxed ultra-fine grained\r\nmicrostructure with an average grain size of 0.4 was observed in the alloy. The present work has\r\nshown that tensile strength, fracture toughness, and fatigue crack growth behaviour of the additively\r\nmanufactured Al 2024 alloy are comparable to the conventional wrought counterparts, and the yield\r\nstrength, hardness, and fracture toughness were better compared to the conventional wrought\r\ncounterparts.\r\nThe mechanical properties obtained were further utilised to design lightweight prototypes of\r\nstructural components of Al 2024 alloy for aerospace applications. The different lightweight\r\nmethodologies, such as topology optimization and internal lattice structure, were combined to explore\r\nthe maximum weight reduction without compromising the strength of the component.

However, recent studies indicate that launching rockets from offshore platforms offers greater advantages compared to land-based launches. Primarily, this approach accommodates the diverse orbital inclination needs of satellites more effectively [1,2]. Furthermore, launching rockets from the sea offers environmentally friendly space launch options by reducing the risk to populated areas in case of launch failures or emergencies. Any emissions and noise produced during launch operations are dispersed across the ocean, potentially lessening their impact on terrestrial ecosystems and human populations. Consequently, deep ocean space launches come with notable benefits such as easy environment clearance and reduced public scrutiny. Despite these advantages, sea launches present unique challenges, necessitating specialized launch platforms capable of withstanding the impulsive forces of rocket propulsion and the harsh marine environment. Therefore, a multi-utility offshore platform must be designed, serving not only for traditional oil production and exploration but also for launching rockets. Developing such platforms for seaborne rocket launches enhances the nationâ€™s space exploration capabilities and contributes to economic growth. Repurposing offshore platforms for rocket launches, makes it suitable for launching satellites for earth exploration, space sciences, and meteorology. Therefore, the present research chose offshore triceratops for its desirable response characteristics. The platform is set apart by a novel ball and socket joint connecting the deck with the buoyant legs, which provides translational dependency between the deck and buoyant legs while ensuring the rotational independence between them. Design principles and analysis methods that govern the dynamics of offshore structures, in general, and Triceratops, in particular, are well-established [3-5]. As the seaborne launch exerts dynamic loading on the platform, the present research focuses on evaluating the dynamic response and stability of the deep ocean triceratops during the rocket launch, through both numerical simulations and experimental analyses.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING ','oeoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-10 06:57:20','Active'),(78,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\'\'CONTEMPORARY WORK AND EMPLOYEE VOICE & SILENCE BEHAVIOR: A VR AND PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION\".','Ms. Apoorva Goel, Roll no.

TRC elements can be lighter in weight, since non-ferrous reinforcements have lower density and require minimal clear cover. The reinforcement in TRC is typically textiles woven using continuous filaments/yarns and aligned in the direction of the tensile stresses, thus reducing the fibre volume up to 50% than that of conventional fibre reinforced concrete (FRC). Normally, TRC systems have AR-glass textiles, made with zirconium glass, to ensure adequate durability in the highly alkaline cementitious system (pH varies from 12.5 to 13). However, AR-glass is expensive and necessities the development of TRC with E-glass, which is available predominantly due to its application in GFRP (glass fibre reinforced polymer). The challenges associated with the development of TRC using E-glass arise from its degradation in the highly alkaline environment of concrete. The replacement of cement with SCMs could be promising due to the reduction in pH and increased rate of carbonation (reduction in pH of the concrete to less than 10 after carbonation). However, the lack of understanding of the mechanisms and rate of degradation of E-glass textiles in concrete with different SCMs, which govern the long-term performance of such composites, is evident. Coating of E-glass is common in textiles and the degradation mechanisms would be different from those of uncoated E-glass and AR-glass, which are not readily available in literature. \r\nThe current study focuses on understanding the mechanism of degradation and the performance of coating against dissolution in simulated pore solution of pH 13 using microstructural analysis. Further, the degradation of coated E-glass subjected to different pH and temperature is quantified in terms of loss of its tensile strength. A correlation among the rate of degradation, pH and temperature is established. The existing binders for AR-glass and E-glass are further optimized for the replacement of cement with SCMs to facilitate higher carbonation rates, necessary to lower the pH at a faster rate, along with adequate strength. Finally, the long-term mechanical performance of the coated E-glass composites will be assessed with the developed binders (with and without carbonation) under accelerated and natural aging conditions. Also, an analytical model to estimate the service life of E-glass TRC composites by incorporating the effect of various factors such as temperature, pH, and relative humidity will be developed. \r\nThis seminar summarizes the existing knowledge on the glass reinforcement, binders and long-term performance of the composites under various factors and lists out the research gaps in the literature.

Due to their omnipresence and unique reactivity, the functionalization of alkenes has become a powerful method for constructing complex organic molecules.[1] In this context, direct chelation-assisted C-H olefination at the inert C-H bonds represents the most straightforward synthetic method for introducing the alkenyl group into organic compounds in a highly regio- and stereoselective manner.[2] Despite the remarkable advances in chelation-assisted C-H olefination reaction, most of the successful transformations are restricted to activated or electronically biased olefins such as acrylates, styrenes, acrylamides, vinyl sulfones, and vinyl phosphonates.[3] Literature reports on chelation-assisted C-H olefination with unactivated or electronically unbiased alkenes are limited due to poor intrinsic reactivity and regioselectivity issues. Despite these notable challenges, highly selective C-H alkenylation and alkylation reactions of unactivated alkenes with the assistance of various directing groups have been achieved in the past few years.[4] Due to novel breakthroughs in this area, there are still limited examples of selective C-H functionalization of olefins. Realizing the need for a viable synthetic transformation for selective alkenylation and alkylation, we have demonstrated the ortho-alkenylation of benzimidates and chalcones with unactivated olefins. [5a,b] Furthermore, we also developed the methodology to synthesize 1H-isoindole derivatives via ortho-olefination followed by aza-Michael addition. On the other hand, we have also demonstrated the Ru-catalyzed ortho-alkylation of benzamides with unactivated olefins.

A variational quantum classifier (VQC) using ultrasonic phased arrays is proposed to extract weld defect features, improving the classification accuracy due to simultaneous qubits. The VQC is trained using a simulation-assisted weld dataset generated using finite element (FE) models and deep convolution generative adversarial networks (DCGAN). The total focusing method (TFM) weld images of porosity and slag are generated using time-transmitted signals received by performing full matrix capture and modeling various defect morphologies using FE simulations. These datasets are then fed to train a DCGAN to generate synthetic TFM images. A feature selection method is used to obtain the best results with a quantum circuit with minimal qubits. Prominent features obtained are supplied to the encoder circuit of the VQC to convert it to a quantum domain, thereby passing to an ansatz circuit to train quantum hyperparameters. The loss is computed for every iteration by optimizing the learnable parameters of the VQC. The VQC is trained by varying quantities of datasets to improve the reliability and efficiency of the weld defect classifications. It is found that VQC, with an accuracy of 96%, outperforms some of the classical machine learning algorithms.\r\n\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkThrough Zoom Meeting Link: https://us05web.zoom.us/j/8582580759?pwd=N0VXMEtlbFNNQ','','',1,'2024-04-11 15:37:43','Active'),(87,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Bio-ionic liquids based soft and adhesive Film for therapeutic applications','Kumari Kiran (BT21D124)','PhD scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Prof. Sanjib Senapati','Department of Biotechnology','2024/04/15 14:30','2024-04-15','','BT Seminar Hall','Bio-ionic liquids, often abbreviated as Bio-ILs, are a class of ionic liquids designed specifically for use in biological or biomedical applications.

The battery serves as the energy source in an electric vehicle due to its high energy density. However, it has a limitation in terms of low power density. Battery life is reduced when exposed to high peak power demand brought on by frequent vehicle acceleration and deceleration. Therefore, the battery is integrated with a supercapacitor to fulfill the high-power requirement. A power management algorithm is needed to effectively utilize both the battery and supercapacitor. This work proposes a power management scheme based on a rule-based filtering technique. The algorithm uses the current division factor based on the instantaneous power loss minimization technique to reduce the system\'s energy loss. In addition, the algorithm uses a novel control approach, which includes a low-pass filtering approach to regulate the supercapacitor SoC. With the proposed algorithm, the improvement is seen in terms of battery power loss and energy loss compared to the existing rule-based algorithm. The algorithm\'s workings and the comparison study are validated through MATLAB/SIMULINK. The experimental studies validated the feasibility of the proposed scheme.','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/pvd-gcqs-ddb','','',1,'2024-04-12 04:54:30','Active'),(89,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','The Semiotics of Contemporary Indian Cricket','Surya Nandana','Ph.D. Research Scholar','Guide: Prof  S P Dhanavel','Humanities and Social Sciences','2024/04/16 15:00','2024-04-16','','Google meet','\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis study examines the significatory practices involved in Indian cricket â€“ in today\r\nâ€™s world of flamboyant performance, affective intensity, dynamic sociocultural identities and functions, corporeality, materiality, digitisation, commercialisation and commemoration â€“ through the lens of Barthesian semiotics.\r\n\r\nThe literature review traces the development of Indian cricket and its sociocultural implications. Cricket histories and journalistic texts by veteran scholars like Ramachandra Guha, Boria Majumdar and Mihir Bose are supported by writings on various dimensions of sport, such as spectacle, stardom and narrativity, by theoreticians like Francis W.

This study applies Barthesian semiotics to analyse cricket matches as texts of human activity (Miles et al., 2014).

Historically, the design of service disciplines focused on optimizing the average linear functions of sojourn times (rewards). Although the goal of optimizing linear rewards is well investigated, hardly any work considers optimizing nonlinear rewards, which have become crucial in many emerging delay-sensitive applications, including quantum communication, multimedia streaming, and online service platforms. \r\n\r\nIn our work, we focus primarily on identifying a single service discipline that maximizes the long-term average of nonlinear rewards. In particular, we view this problem for two arrival models - the first is a burst arrival model, wherein all jobs arrive at the server at the same instant. We show that the shortest job first (SJF) discipline maximizes the average reward for any monotonic function of the sojourn times. In the second setting, jobs arrive according to some stochastic process with i.i.d. service requirements. This setting is significantly more challenging to analyze, and identifying an optimal discipline remains elusive. We introduce a new service discipline, shortest predicted sojourn time (SPST), and provide analytical guarantees under specific settings. Numerically, we demonstrate that SPST outperforms well-known disciplines across multiple settings.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-12 09:39:59','Active'),(99,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\"Synthetic Lipids with Tunable Polarity Characteristics for Drug Delivery Applications\"','Ms. Akshaya K V (CY17D025)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Muraleedharan K M, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/17 15:00','2024-04-17','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','Drug delivery vehicles are generally formed from lipids, polymers or metal-organic frameworks, and are used to modulate the ADMET profiles of therapeutic entities. Apart from being bio-compatible, supramolecular or macromolecular matrices thus formed should not only favour high drug entrapment but also allow the release of constituents in a controlled manner. Because of rapid resistance induction on using monotherapy, use of drug combination has become inevitable in most of the disease areas. This has necessitated the development of carriers which can entrap more than one drug. This is challenging since the final concentration of individual constituents at the target site depends on multiple factors which include their stability under physiological conditions, differences in release rates etc. Previous research from our laboratory has shown the potential of oxanorbornane-based amphiphiles for drug delivery applications.1 The present work focusses on specific modifications on the head group for achieving multi-drug delivery. Considering the therapeutic relevance of low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (gasotransmitter), we have conjugated 1,2-dithiol-3-thione unit to the head group of such synthetic lipids and have used the conjugate as a vehicle for ibuprofen.2a Conjugation of 5FA (Anti-cancer agent) to the head group and use of the conjugates for co-delivery of Doxorubicin, and alteration of the polarity characteristics of the head group to modulate the uptake and toxicity profile of Doxorubicin are the other areas investigated.2b\r\nReferences:\r\n1. a) Gadde, S.

Experiments are conducted in the Weber number\r\nrange of 179 - 929; the corresponding Reynolds numbers are 5253 - 12091. The profile\r\nof the droplet interface is studied. Assuming self-similarity in the internal flow at the\r\ndroplet interface, the profiles are scaled using appropriate scales. It is observed that\r\nthe profiles of the droplet interface at different points of time collapse close to each\r\nother when plotted in this manner. This observation is experimental evidence of the\r\nself-similarity of the internal flow in this phase. Based on this fact, kinetic\r\nenergy is estimated at the early stages of droplet impact. The surface energy is also estimated by assuming axisymmetric droplet profile obtained through back-light imaging. We observe that a considerable amount of kinetic energy is lost during the early stages of droplet impact. We believe that an accurate estimation of this deficit in kinetic energy at an early stage of impact will be necessary to account for the energy-based models for droplet impact. Also due to initial kinetic energy, the droplet rapidly spreads outward upon impact until the viscous dissipation and the surface tension force slow the spreading. After a period, the droplet spreads slower while the film thinning rate becomes stagnant, resulting in a residual thickness. A measurement technique using a Chromatic Confocal Sensor is used here for the thickness measurement. This sensor allows to measure droplet thickness with high precision. Using the information on early phase energy dissipation and experimental data on spreading diameter and thickness, a model can be developed to capture the temporal evolution of droplet diameter during spreading.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/bdx-wojv-dqa','','',1,'2024-04-12 10:07:25','Active'),(101,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\"Metal-Free Synthesis of Stable Imidazolium and Pyrrolium Salts: Comprehensive Investigation of their Chemical, Photophysical, and Redox Properties\"','Mr. Prathap R (CY19D006)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Dr. Kartik Chandra Mondal, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/17 16:00','2024-04-17','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','The Ïƒ-donor stable singlet CAAC/NHC carbene has been reacted with in situ generated electron hungry aryne leading to the formation of initial carbene-aryne intermediate which further undergoes aryl group migration from N-atom of carbene to arynes leading to air-stable cyclic imine/imidazole product with C2 blocking in very good to excellent yields.

Electrochemical energy storage systems such as supercapacitor present promising solutions for meeting the rising energy demands due to their high-power density and cyclic stability.1,2 There is a continuous quest for discovering new materials that can outperform conventional electrode materials, driving significant demand for researchers to explore nanoparticles.3 In this work, copper tellurate (Cu3TeO6) has been synthesized and investigated as novel active nanomaterial for electrode fabrication for energy storage device. Among various tellurium-based compounds, Cu3TeO6 nanoparticles show promise for high-performance battery-type supercapacitor.4 Combining the high electrical conductivity and tunability of copper with structural stability of tellurium holds promise for enhancing energy storage performance.5 The colloquium will cover a brief introduction on the working principle of supercapacitor, nanomaterials and their properties relevant to diverse energy applications. In the first part, synthesis, physicochemical characterization and application of Cu3TeO6 nanoparticles for charge storage will be discussed.6 In the later part, morphological variations of Cu3TeO6 induced by surfactants during the synthesis, and their effect on the size, shape, and porous structure, and finally on their performance as supercapacitor electrodes will be presented. Surfactants functionalize the surface of nanoparticles, altering their surface chemistry and improving their compatibility with electrolyte solutions. This enhances the overall electrochemical performance of the electrode material in terms of storage and long cycling life. Further, Cu3TeO6 composite with carbon is synthesized to further enhance the storage performance and stability.

A computational framework based on the open-source CFD library OpenFOAM to study these instabilities in the context of afterburners is developed. \r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on the numerical investigation of flame dynamics and the thermo-acoustic oscillations of the bluff body combustor known as the Single Flameholder Agumentor (SFA) test rig at the Georgia Institute of Technology. These experiments used vitiated and high-velocity inlet conditions (Oxygen 15%, T=800â° C, and M=0.2-0.4) with spray-injected non-premixed mode of combustion. In these experiments, longitudinal thermo-acoustic instabilities in the range of 200-250 Hz were encountered, along with high-frequency wake flame oscillations above 1000 Hz. First comparison of modelling results with experimental data from the non-reacting conditions from the SFA is presented. Following this, results for the reacting cases with three global equivalence ratios of 0.5, 0.7, and 1 are considered. The results are analyzed to get insights into the mean temperature profiles, flame structure, pressure oscillations, fuel penetration effects, and the amplitude of the BVK oscillations. In this work, the hybrid LES model is used; this offers the advantage of not necessitating extremely fine grids by switching to RANS-based models in the near-wall regions. The Lagrangian approach is used to track droplets from the liquid spray injection into the computational domain. The simulations are carried out using the compressible Navier-Stokes solver â€œsprayFoamâ€ which also allows for the modeling of Lagrangian parcel injection. \r\nThe non-reacting results show large velocities up to 400 m/s near the flameholder trailing edge in addition to a von Karman-type vortex shedding at a Strouhal number of 0.25.  The reacting flow results show variation in the flame topology depending on the fuel injection rates.  The simulations show large amplitude pressure oscillations at 250 Hz for the highest equivalence ratio case, mirroring the experimental observations. By applying the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) technique, we confirm the excitation of the Â¾ th longitudinal of the combustor during the instability. Furthermore, the DMD of the fuel mass fraction field also confirmed the oscillations in the spray stream at the thermoacoustic frequency, indicating a thermoacoustic coupling. Also, high frequency (>1200 Hz) oscillations of the wake flame due to flame holder vortex shedding are correctly reproduced in the simulations. \r\n\r\nThus, this part of the work forms a basis for the development of a comprehensive computational framework for predicting and diagnosing thermoacoustic instabilities in the context of afterburners using OpenFOAM. Further studies can build upon these findings to optimize afterburner design and mitigate thermo-acoustic instabilities.','Varunkumar S','varuns@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-14 06:27:23','Active'),(105,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','OFFSHORE TOPSIDE WITH STEEL AND FGM STIFFENED COPED BEAM','Mr. Thennavan M,OE21D004, Ph.D Scholar','Mr. Thennavan M,OE21D004, Ph.D Scholar','Prof. Srinivasan chandrasekaran - Guide','Ocean Engineering Department','2024/04/15 14:00','2024-04-15','','Seminar Hall, Department of Ocean Engineering','Coped steel beams are the preferred option for enhancing the functionality and structural integrity of an offshore topside. Implementing coping strategies helps prevent the accumulation of multiple pipelines and cables in the workspace. The steel coped beam experiences local yielding and buckling due to the combined effects of waves, wind, impact, and accidental loads, which result in high-stress concentration. Functionally-graded materials (FGM) are viable substitutes for structural components in unique circumstances. This study addresses the development of a new material for strengthening coped beams using functionally grading Stellite-6 steel, which is a highly corrosion-resistant alloy, with carbon-manganese steel. The mechanical properties of the newly developed FGM are evaluated and compared to those of the alloying materials to demonstrate their superiority. FGM samples are produced using Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM), a cost-effective method known for its high deposition rates. Tensile test specimens conforming to ASTM E8 standards are extracted from the FGM build to evaluate its structural properties. The newly developed FGM demonstrates approximately 50% higher yield strength and 48% higher ultimate strength compared to X52 steel. The suitability of FGM for offshore applications is confirmed by its advantages in terms of carbon equivalency and weldability. The FGM-stiffened coped beams are suggested as alternative options because of their improved structural characteristics and durable character. The current study utilizes FGM (Functionally Graded Materials) to reinforce the coped beam by incorporating stiffeners. The mechanical properties of the constituent materials, Stellite-6 and Carbon Manganese steel, are improved by functionally grading them to better suit structural engineering applications. This study investigates the microstructure evaluation and mechanical properties of FGMs (Functionally Graded Materials), specifically Stellite-6 and Carbon Manganese steel, which were produced using wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). Variation in thermal gradient during layer deposition affects microstructure, improving the novel FGM\'s structural properties over its constituents. The alloy grain structure, precipitated phases, and improved mechanical properties are evaluated using SEM analysis. Experimental investigations validate a notable decrease in the rate of corrosion in the functionally graded material (FGM) as a result of the inclusion of Stellite-6. Additionally, it enhances the strength and durability, qualities that are greatly desired for coped beam stiffeners. \r\nCoped beams are often used in the fabrication of land structures; however, the existence of coped regions significantly restricts the maximum load-bearing capacity and may even lead to unfavorable failure modes. This study aims to examine the recently introduced coped beam concept in offshore construction, as well as the failure modes of coped steel and FGM Stiffened beams. The steel beams with coping and the FGM-strengthened coped beam was produced and subjected to experimental evaluation. Furthermore, a finite element model was created and verified using the experimental data. Subsequently, a parametric analysis was performed to measure the impact of different cope geometries. The steel and FGM Stiffened coped beams were analyzed and compared using the 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method. The results were compared to both numerical and experimental data, and a strong correlation was observed. The maximum load for specimen CB-600 exceeds the maximum load for specimens CB-500 and CB-300 by 22% and 50% respectively. The duration of the post-peak and instability stages in specimen CP-600 is greater than that of specimens CB-500 and CB-300. The results demonstrate that the cope has an impact on the loading carrying capacity and buckling of coped beams with varying cope geometries. The parametric analysis results indicated that the shape of the cope had a significant impact on the structural performance of the steel beams. The Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique facilitated the quantification of strain and deformation in the steel-coped beams, yielding a valuable understanding of their response to various loading conditions. The comparison between numerical and experimental results further confirmed the precision of the finite element model, emphasizing its utility in predicting the performance of coped steel and FGM beams in offshore construction. The overall study highlights the importance of using new FGM materials in offshore topside and heavy industries that require coped beams to accommodate service mains.\r\n','Ocean Engineering Department','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-15 03:41:46','Active'),(106,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\'\'PROFITABLE MARKET MECHANISM FOR PLATFORM, BASED AGGREGATOR TAXI SERVICES\'\'','Mr. SWAMINATHAN RAMMOHAN, MS16D009','Ph.D. SCHOLAR','Prof. RAHUL R .

While the pioneering works of M. K. Geraghty and W. J. Carroll provided a fundamental understanding of this field, a multitude of studies in the past two decades have aimed to improve the profitability of taxi services. We begin with an extensive examination of contemporary literature concerning RM practices specifically applied in the taxi industry. The literature review is centered around essential aspects such as pricing mechanisms, market structure, business models, technological innovations, and marketing strategies. Through a comprehensive analysis of relevant research articles, this study aims to unveil novel trends and progressive research avenues in the domain of the taxi industry RM. Additionally, the literature review aims to identify significant gaps in existing literature, thereby paving the way for future investigations and scholarly exploration.\r\nBased on the literature review, it was evident that the selection of sales channels plays a critical role in the context of platform-based taxi services (PATS). Notably, PATS recently incorporated a variant of opaque selling known as group rides, where passengers with nearby pick-up and drop-off locations and coinciding departure times are grouped together for a single ride. Typically, PATS employ a listed price strategy for both regular and opaque channels, which limits passengers and drivers to accept or decline rides without any scope for further negotiation or engagement. To address this limitation, we propose the introduction of an alternative channel called \'Name Your Own Price\' (NYOP). This novel channel introduces a certain level of opacity regarding ride features and additional waiting time, while efficiently capturing the preferences of both passengers and drivers. The introduction of NYOP presents a valuable opportunity to accommodate passengers with lower ride valuations, who were previously excluded due to higher fixed prices. By enabling passengers to suggest their own prices, the NYOP channel facilitates the provision of rides at reduced rates, making transportation more accessible and affordable for a wider range of passengers.\r\nIn our first analytical model, we demonstrate that the increased level of opacity and additional waiting times in sales channels provided by the NYOP leads to improved passenger segmentation, resulting in higher revenue for the platform. Moreover, the NYOP channel creates additional ride opportunities for drivers, enabling them to generate extra revenue and\r\nachieve the incentive threshold set by the platform. Furthermore, our research delves into the decision-making processes of drivers when faced with the option of an NYOP channel in the presence of target-based incentives, providing valuable insights into their bidding behaviour.\r\nSubsequently, our second analytical study delves into the examination of driver behavior through the lens of PATS in the presence of market competition. If a driver has the choice of selecting a taxi ride when there are two platforms available, it is worth investigating the driver\'s switching behavior, especially in the presence of incentives. In this study, we propose a framework for optimally designing the platform policies in a duopoly market in the presence of driver incentives for completing a threshold number of rides in a given time period. Our analysis has uncovered a pattern in the decision-making of platform 1, and our findings indicate that platform 1 maximizes its utility by prioritizing the ease of sending rides to a driver when she is commencing her day, thus aligning its interests with the driver\'s goal of accumulating rides. However, as the driver approaches the target-based threshold for incentives, platform 1 diminishes its motivation to provide additional ride opportunities to the driver.\r\nOur contributions in the field of operations management play a crucial role in enhancing taxi utilization rates. Further, we provide recommendations to platforms for increasing the taxi market efficiency, especially during non-peak hours. In addition, we focus on understanding customer behavior by segmenting passengers based on their valuation, opacity quotient, and waiting times. Further, we introduce alternative pricing strategies and devise revenue maximization techniques for PATS. These contributions are aimed at optimizing the overall performance and effectiveness of the taxi industry during periods of lower demand, ultimately benefiting passengers, taxi drivers, and platforms.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION.-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadr','','',1,'2024-04-15 04:43:57','Active'),(107,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Integrative biology approach to unravel the mechanism of immunogenic response and protein assembly in  Dengue and Zika viruses','Jaya Vasavi P (BT21D402)','Ph.D. scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Dr. Sanjib Senapati (BT)','Department of Biotechnology','2024/04/17 15:30','2024-04-17','','BT Seminar Hall','Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are most prevalent mosquito-borne pathogens belonging to the Flaviviridae family. Globally, about 400 million DENV infections and nearly 40,000 deaths are reported every year. In 2015 alone, ZIKV affected over 200,000 individuals, causing Microcephaly and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. Despite their severity in transmission, no approved drugs/vaccines are available, presumably due to the structural complexity and lack of molecular-level insights of the virus particles. During viral infection, innate immune cells present degraded viral proteins via MHC proteins. T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognize these antigens presented by MHC, initiating a T-cell immune response. However, the underlying mechanism of triggered immune response during MHC-antigen-TCR interaction is unknown. Using coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we explore conformational changes in TCR that lead to T-cell immunogenicity and introduce Machine Learning strategies to extract important features. This can aid in the in-silico identification of viable viral antigens priming vaccine design. Another approach to inhibit viral infection is to rupture the virion assembly. Here, we investigate the self-assembly process of viral E proteins through accelerated MD simulations. Elucidating the atomic details of E protein dimerization could pave ways to examine various pockets for drug binding and, thus, to design drugs to inhibit DENV and ZIKV.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-15 04:56:23','Active'),(108,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Modeling failure of solids in fluid-structure interaction problems','Mr. S P Krishna Phanindra,  ED19D750','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Engineering Design','Dr. Shankar Ram C S (Chair)\r\n\r\nDr. Srikanth Vedantam  (Guide)\r\n\r\nDr.  Sandipan Bandyopadhyay,\r\n\r\nDr. R Jayaganthan\r\n\r\nDr. Sarith P Sathian, AM','Engineering Design Department','2024/04/15 16:30','2024-04-15','','Google Meet joining info Video call link: https://meet.google.com/jss-stdc-oxh','Modeling fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems is of great importance in diverse engineering areas. Traditional grid-based frameworks are used to study such problems but have been found to suffer from various difficulties, especially in problems involving large deformations of the solid and structural failure. Particle-based approaches for modeling the fluid as well as the solid are gaining prominence due to their advantages in these settings. However, most of these approaches limit themselves to linear elastic solids. In this study, we present a novel particle-based fluid-structure interaction framework based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model for fluids and a recently developed constitutively informed particle dynamics (CPD) model for solids. We present the detailed methodology for coupling these approaches to solve FSI problems. The advantage of this framework is its ability to model failure and a wide range of solid constitutive behavior, which hasn\'t been studied earlier in the literature. Using the proposed model, we study the failure of notched hyperelastic obstacles impacted by fluid flow.','EDOffice','edoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-15 05:55:03','Active'),(109,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','â€œANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF OPERATING CONDITIONS ON LITHIUM-ION BATTERY DEGRADATIONâ€','MR.

The technology has established itself as a reliable energy storage mechanism over the past decade. Nevertheless, it continues to face challenges, including safety concerns, prolonged charging duration, and a decline in capacity over time. One of the major safety concerns is the lithium plating phenomenon encountered in lithium-ion batteries. Lithium plating is the reduction of lithium ions on the surface of the negative electrode while charging a lithium-ion battery. Lithium plating reaction can eventually lead to dendrite formation and shorting of the battery. The lithium plating phenomenon has been attributed to two major factors, viz. increased charging voltage and charging at low temperatures. Charging a battery under these conditions increases the concentration of lithium ions at the anode compared to what can be intercalated into the electrode. This leads to a drop in electrochemical potential, and the ions get reduced on the surface of the electrode.\r\n\r\nTo understand the degradation of lithium-ion batteries at different temperatures, a first-principles-based electro-thermal battery model was developed. The model incorporates two different parasitic side reactions: the lithium plating reaction and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formation reaction. These two reactions consume the lithium ions in the battery, leading to its degradation. The first principles-based model can detect changes in desired and undesired reactions at different temperatures. The model can also quantify the amount of lithium lost to the parasitic side reactions. Understanding these side reactions in the battery will help develop methodologies to mitigate its degradation while improving its safety.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','The Ph.D. RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM SEMINAR in respect of Mr. ARUN MUTHUKKUMARAN (CH19D751) will be held o','seminar15-04-2024 06:09','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar15-04-2024 06:09',1,'2024-04-15 06:09:27','Active'),(110,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\"Spectroscopic and Kinetic investigations of Aromatic, Aliphatic Volatile Organic Compounds, and Halogen Monoxide Using State-of-the-Art Experimental Techniques and Theoretical Methods\"','Mr. Prasanna Kumar Bej (CY18D098)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Rajakumar B, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/18 16:00','2024-04-18','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','The atmospheric oxidants, such as OH, Cl, NOx, or ozone, react with the relevant atmospheric substrate or transient species, forming radicals and stable products, which could potentially impact the environment by creating soot particles or aerosols. The pollutants reportedly have an impact on the human respiratory system as well as on the biotic world1.\r\nAromatic hydrocarbons like benzene, toluene, and xylene are oxidized to form resonance-stabilized radicals in the atmosphere. Among all the isomers of xylene, o-xylene is one of the most widely used isomers, which finds its usage in paints, adhesives, coating, etc. When o-xylene gets emitted into the atmosphere, it reacts with atmospheric oxidants and forms the resonance stabilized o-xylyl radical. The study involving the measurement of the absolute absorption cross-section of o-xylyl radical in the wavelength range of 460.1â€“475.1 nm using CRDS will be discussed1. The five-membered hetero-aromatic compounds like pyrrole, furan, and thiophene play a critical role in cloud formation, influencing cloud properties like albedo, lifetime and consequently affect the Earth\'s radiative balance. The experimental and theoretical temperature-dependent reaction kinetics of Cl-atom and OH-radical with methyl thiophene will be discussed as one part of the study.\r\nThe reduction of the ozone layer in the stratosphere is effectively facilitated by the emission of halogen compounds (X=F, Cl, Br, and I) from anthropogenic and artificial resources, mostly in coastal areas (2,3). The oxide substituent of these compounds, especially monoxides (XO), has a significant role in ozone depletion. Peroxy radicals, RO2 (R=H, CH3, C2H5, C3H7, etc.) are the primary consumers of halogen monoxides in the atmosphere. Therefore, one of the studies will encompass a discussion on the experimental and theoretical determination of reaction rates between propyl peroxy and iso-propyl peroxy with BrO radical, facilitated by CRDS methodology. Furthermore, a theoretical kinetic study of isoprene (known as Bio VOCs) with XO (Cl, Br, I) will be discussed to analyze the oxidation impact of isoprene.\r\nReferences:\r\n1)	Bej, P.

It oxidizes saturated fatty acyl-CoAs at the 9th position to create a double bond to synthesize monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), e.g., Palmitoleate and oleate. Two different isoforms of SCD have been identified in human tissues: SCD1 and SCD5. SCD1 is the major isoform, ubiquitously expressed, with a prevalence in adipose tissues and various organs such as the heart, brain, liver, and lungs. MUFAs act as a substrate for the synthesis of various lipids, including phospholipids (PLs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), triacylglycerols (TAGs), and cholesteryl esters (CEs), which act as a reactant for many essential components of biological membranes, as well as a cellular energy source and intracellular signaling molecules. Overexpression of SCD1 has been correlated with cancer aggressiveness and poor prognosis across tumors. SCD1 promotes the maintenance/acquisition of stem-like features, including chemoresistance and self-renewal. A strong correlation between SCD1 and tumor signaling, cellular energetics, membrane maintenance, and anti-ferroptosis activity is demonstrated by various studies in the literature. We hypothesize that developing a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) molecule against the SCD1 protein is expected to degrade SCD1 selectively in cancer cells. PROTAC is a hetero-bifunctional small molecule comprising a ligand binding to the protein of interest (POI), which is linked with another small molecule binding to E3 ligase through the spacer. Upon binding with both partners, E3 ligase is expected to facilitate ubiquitinylation on the protein of interest (POI). After ubiquitinylation, POI would undergo degradation via the 26S proteasomal pathway. Targeted protein degradation of SCD-1 in cancer cells, would be achieved by linking small molecule ligand of E3 ligase which is expressed exclusively or overexpressed in cancer cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-16 04:06:24','Active'),(118,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Mpemba effect: An anomalous relaxation phenomenon','R.

Such research provides insights into the impacts of extreme weather events on shorelines, aiding in better preparedness and coastal management strategies. This research primarily aims to develop a statistical model that forecasts the potential peak surge height near to the landfall location of cyclone along the Bay of Bengal (BoB). The peak surge height at the landfall location leads to more extensive coastal flooding and increased damage to coastal structures. However, numerical models predict storm surges but are computationally expensive for just predicting peak surge height. Machine Learning (ML) is more efficient but demands vast datasets for accuracy. To resolve this, a new approach is essentialâ€”efficient and accurate with minimal data. Introducing the Tropical Cyclone Surge Potential Index (TCSPI) utilizes readily available real-time atmospheric data and bathymetric data. A retrospective analysis of TCSPI using Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) data from 1990â€“2021, effectively captures historical events in the Bay of Bengal. This study also incorporated various regression-based Machine Learning (ML) models, rapidly predicts the potential peak surge height across the coastal BoB region using same input parameters provided to the TCSPI. Comparing observed peak surges with observation, TCSPI demonstrates relatively lower errors as compared to best performing regression-based ML model. \r\nFurther, this study aims to improve the cyclonic wind field to better forecast the surge and inundation. Many literatures emphasized cyclonic wind field since cyclonic winds play a fundamental role in predicting surges and flooding. Therefore, a more accurate depiction of these wind fields is crucial. Further, estimating ocean wave parameters in tropical areas is difficult due to the complexity of wind fields associated with tropical cyclones (TCs). Usually, parametric and global model wind fields are the two primary sources to acquire wind and pressure fields to estimate the storm surges. The parametric models usually depict a better wind field near the cyclone center. Unlike the parametric models, the wind fields from global models have better accuracy in the areas far away from the eye of the cyclone. Owing to this inconsistency, a blended wind field approach has been introduced. \r\n','Ocean Engineering Department','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-16 04:27:19','Active'),(120,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','From multi-modal data to systems-level modeling of cellular processes','Mr. Nilesh Anantha Subramanian, CS20D300','PhD.

While established models of such bioprocesses under healthy and perturbed (disease) states exist, critical gaps around double-disease states and MMÃ GRN interactions remain. Towards this end, we propose computational frameworks based on statistical models and constraint-based (linear optimization) techniques in the context of these two studies: \r\n\r\nI)  A systematic methodology using linear models to quantify disease-disease interaction (DDI) effects in immune response: Studies have shown that immune responses in a person suffering from two diseases (comorbidity) could be more complex than the union of responses to each disease occurring separately. A data-driven quantification of this complexity is lacking though. We propose a three-step computational framework based on linear models with interaction terms to analyze data from multiple groups of individuals (healthy group, single-disease patients, and double-disease group), to identify, quantify, and interpret the double-disease (DDI) markers. Application of this framework to helminth infection and diabetes revealed DDI markers like TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, and IL-2, etc., and IL-4/13 and IL-10 immune signaling pathways to be enriched in the target genes of these DDI markers. Our approach is generic and can be applied to dissect DDI mechanisms behind other comorbid conditions as well.\r\n\r\nII) Iterative surgery on a probabilistic causal network to model MMÃ GRN feedback: Integrated MM and GRN models can help predict the behavior of a complex biological system. Several works capture the information flow from GRN to MM via Boolean rules, however none model the feedback from MM to GRN. I will present an iterative algorithm that models this feedback via causal surgeries on a probabilistic GRN network and combines inference on this network with a known linear program representation of MM. I will also present preliminary results from the application of this integrated GRNÃŸÃ MM model on simulated and real-world datasets.\r\n\r\nI will conclude the talk with a perspective on how methods and insights from the above studies encourage the development of multi-omic predictive models of bioprocesses.

Despite holding 18% of the world\'s population, India possesses only 4% of the world\'s water resources. Beyond agriculture, the most water-intensive industries include the fashion and petrochemical sectors. According to the 2019 report by the World Resources Institute (WRI), Indian textile industries consume 1.6 billion litres of water daily, with the production of a single pair of jeans requiring around 2000 litres of water. Concurrently, petrochemical wastewater production amounts to 1.3 billion litres per day, with petroleum refineries typically generating approximately 1.5 times the volume of wastewater per unit of refined petroleum oil. UN-Water forecasts a 55% increase in water demand by 2050, including a 400% rise in manufacturing water demand. Without intervention, by 2040, global water scarcity may impede both quenching the world population\'s thirst and sustaining current energy solutions. NITI Aayog warns that 21 major cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, and Chennai, face severe water crises in India. Therefore, urgent action is required for sustainable development, necessitating innovative water purification technologies to treat industrial effluents for reuse and recycling. Such technologies must overcome existing limitations and tackle emerging pollutants.\r\nGas hydrate-based water purification, an innovative technology, shows significant promise due to its unique characteristics, utilizing crystalline structures formed by water and gas molecules under specific conditions to effectively remove contaminants. These hydrates demonstrate notable purification by selectively eliminating contaminants from their structure. Additionally, aerogels have the ability to adsorb contaminants such as emerging pollutants, heavy metals, organic pollutants, and dyes from water, making them valuable in industrial water purification.

The battery serves as the energy source in an electric vehicle due to its high energy density. However, it has a limitation in terms of low power density. Battery life is reduced when exposed to high peak power demand brought on by frequent vehicle acceleration and deceleration. Therefore, the battery is integrated with a supercapacitor to fulfill the high-power requirement. A power management algorithm is needed to effectively utilize both the battery and supercapacitor. This work proposes a power management scheme based on a rule-based filtering technique. The algorithm uses the current division factor based on the instantaneous power loss minimization technique to reduce the system\'s energy loss. In addition, the algorithm uses a novel control approach, which includes a low-pass filtering approach to regulate the supercapacitor SoC. With the proposed algorithm, the improvement is seen in terms of battery power loss and energy loss compared to the existing rule-based algorithm. The algorithm\'s workings and the comparison study are validated through MATLAB/SIMULINK. The experimental studies validated the feasibility of the proposed scheme.','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/pvd-gcqs-ddb','','',1,'2024-04-16 10:17:07','Active'),(128,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','System-level Investigation of Multilayered-packed Bed Thermocline Tank for CSP Plants','Mr. Jawahar V (ME11D026)','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM\r\n','Guide: Prof. K.

Centralized federated learning operates with a central server coordinating model updates across nodes, while decentralized federated learning operates in a peer-to-peer manner and models are trained by distributed stochastic gradient descent (DSGD). It is known that the success of DSGD depends critically on the underlying topology specified by a mixing matrix. Another factor that affects DSGS is data heterogeneity, a term used to denote the fact that the local data distribution of the individual nodes is different from the overall population distribution. Designing the right mixing matrix which balances such data heterogeneity is key for the success of DSGD. Recently an algorithm called Sparse Topology Learning - Frank Wolfe (STL-FW) was proposed to tackle data heterogeneity. At the start of training, STL-FW computes a sparse mixing matrix by optimizing an objective which combines the spectral gap and data heterogeneity.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we address two important shortcomings of STL-FW. Firstly, the topology returned by STL-FW may not be realizable in practice due to physical constraints. We propose a novel variant called Constrained Topology Learning - Frank Wolfe (CTL-FW) to compute an optimal mixing matrix which respects the underlying topological constraints. Secondly, during training, the local models exhibit heterogeneity. However, the mixing matrix computed by STL-FW at the start may not be sufficient to mitigate model heterogeneity occurring during training. We propose a novel variant called Dynamic Constrained Topology Learning - Frank Wolfe (DCTL-FW) which uses the test accuracies of the local models to compute a new mixing matrix every round. We show that DSGD performs better when it uses mixing matrices computed by CTL-FW and DCTL-FW in comparison to random mixing matrices (of the same topology) via experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets.','Hema G, CS Office','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-16 11:16:46','Active'),(130,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€œSOME NOVEL FRACTAL FUNCTIONS AND FRACTAL RADIAL BASIS FUNCTIONS: APPLICATIONS AND INSIGHTS â€ ','Mr. Deependra Kumar, MA19D014','Research Scholar, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','DC Members: Dr. Satyajit Roy Dr. Shruti Dubey / Dr. K.

Various oil extraction mechanisms are used for this purpose. Our study proposes an oil extraction structure and examines how channel parameters, especially height relative to droplet size, impact droplet clustering. Smaller droplets, relative to channel dimensions, follow continuous flow dynamics, allowing for simple hydrodynamic resistive modelling to estimate their parameters. However, when droplet diameter exceeds channel height, their dynamics deviate significantly, requiring a more complex modelling approach. The integration of sedimentation and hindrance theory, along with the consideration of relative hindrance (H) of a droplet due to its proximity to neighbouring droplets, has significantly improved the prediction of droplet parameters for densely packed droplets. Finally, the developed microfluidic platform enables high-throughput (200-400 droplets per second) droplet clustering for incubating (for about 30-70 minutes) a large number of cell-encapsulated droplets (about millions) efficiently.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/qgw-waew-jqr','','',1,'2024-04-17 04:37:35','Active'),(132,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Reduced-order models to predict mesoscale mechanical behavior of polycrystalline materials','Mr. K Vineet Kumar Reddy (AM17D026)','Ph.

The fatigue properties of polycrystalline metals are dictated by the mesoscale mechanical response (stress and strain) of the material to the applied load. Full-field solutions at the mesoscale, involving constitutive equations of crystal plasticity, are computationally expensive. Therefore, this dissertation aims to develop reduced-order models to efficiently: a) represent the material microstructure; and b) predict the mesoscale mechanical response of polycrystalline material.\r\n\r\nThe standard mathematical representation of polycrystalline microstructure comprises the lattice orientation field. For computational purposes, the microstructural domains are typically discretized into sub-grain size voxels, rendering the lattice orientation field a high-dimensional representation. The first part of this thesis explored two alternative low-dimensional representations based on: 1) input parameters associated with Voronoi tessellation; and 2) principal component analysis. However, both these approaches prove inadequate for the current purpose. In view of this observation, low-rank approximation (LRA), a technique suitable for high-dimensional inputs, was investigated. Specifically, a rank-one approximation of the localization tensor was developed to predict the mesoscale strain field within the elastic constitutive framework. The voxel-level strains predicted by the rank-one approximation closely match the crystal plasticity fast Fourier transform (CPFFT) solver.\r\n\r\nMetal fatigue is associated with the accumulation of plastic strains in grains. Thus, in fatigue-related applications, it is often necessary, and sufficient, to compute stresses and strains averaged over grains. Therefore, a data-science-based reduced-order model was developed to predict the grain-averaged state of stress. Towards this, a novel statistical representation called the grain-neighborhood function was constructed, which captures the occurrence frequency of various lattice orientations in the vicinity of the crystal grain of interest. The proposed methodology agrees with results obtained using crystal plasticity simulations for polycrystalline aggregates subjected to uniaxial deformation. The last part of the thesis shows that transfer learning can adapt the above model to new textures and morphologies using a limited amount of new training data.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle link : https://meet.google.com/civ-ugnb-yov','','',1,'2024-04-17 04:54:51','Active'),(133,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','INDOOR AIR POLLUTION CHARACTERISTICS, HEALTH IMPACTS AND MITIGATION OPTIONS FOR BIOMASS EMISSIONS FROM COOKING ACTIVITIES IN RURAL HOUSEHOLD KITCHENS IN INDIA','Ms. Gopika I, Roll No: CE18D405','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. S M Shiva Nagendra - Guide, Dr. Ligy Philip - DC Member, Dr. S Mathava Kumar - DC Member, Dr. Smita Srivastava, BT - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/04/23 11:15','2024-04-23','yes','Conference Room (BSB 104)','','Mathangi G','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-17 05:16:20','Active'),(134,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Flexible antennas for targeted hyperthermia treatment of cervical cancer through microwave transparent intrauterine tandem','Mr. Shabeeb Ahamed KP (BT15D050)','Ph.D. Research Scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Prof. Kavitha Arunachalam\r\nCo-Guide: Dr. Thomas Samuel Ram (CMC Vellore)\r\n','Department of Biotechnology','2024/04/18 15:00','2024-04-18','','Google Meet - https://meet.google.com/jsh-moic-pog','Locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be a socio-economic burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as India, with poor disease prognosis, and it demands affordable adjuvant treatment options. Microwave (MW) hyperthermia (HT), which involves selective heating of malignant tumour to 40-44 â„ƒ for 60 minutes has shown to improve treatment outcomes for cervical cancer when combined with radiotherapy. Commercial phased array HT device is not affordable for LMICs. This thesis presents a custom designed microwave transparent intrauterine tandem and flexible antennas for delivering intracavitary HT (IHT) at the cervix as an adjuvant therapy for high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy (BT) to improve clinical outcomes for LACC patients in LMIC. \r\nMajor challenge addressed in this research is the design and development of low-profile coaxial flexible antennas with broadband choke and water circulation ports for guidance through an intrauterine tandem with bend angle for targeted IHT delivery at the cervix. In comparison with a conventional coaxial balun, ferrite sleeve as a choke offered larger bandwidth and localized specific absorption rate (SAR) within the -15 dB bandwidth of coaxial monopole antennas, but it with an 11% lower maximum SAR than the resonant coaxial balun. Coaxial antennas with 3ï¬/8 active length and localized power deposition characteristics were realized using broadband flexible ferrite sheet as the choke. Flexible single and multi-band antennas were developed to deliver spatially varying thermal dose to address the variatons in tumor dimensions and patient anatomy. The flexible ferrite sheet is electrically small (0.46ï¬ ) compared to the resonant balun designs reported in literature and was demonstrated to effectively choke the secondary current on the coaxial MW antennas over a broad operating frquency (700-2450 MHz), where ï¬ is the effective wavelength of the medium surrounding the antenna. The broadband operation of the low profile ferrite choke was demonstrated for flexible single and multiband resonant antennas operating over 700-2450 MHz. Hyperthermia treatment delivery technique with frequency hopping and control of dwell time and delivered power was proposed to realize spatially varying localized power deposition and steady state thermal dose using multiband flexible antennas. \r\nThe fabricated prototypes of the intrauterine tandem of 8 mm diameter and 250 mm length and flexible antennas were assessed on tissue phantoms and ex-vivo bovine muscle tissues. Phantom and ex vivo tissue heating experiments demonstrated that the intrauterine tandem applicator with flexible antennas is capable of delivering localized power deposition at the target in agreement with the numerical simulations. The target volume at the cervix was 62.5 cm3 at 700 MHz and 18.3 cm3 at 2450 MHz, respectively for antennas with single resonance. For dual band antenna with resonance at 700 and 1300 MHz, tumor target volume could be varied from 28.5 to 62.4 cm3 by controlling the excitation frequency, dwell time and delivered power.  It is concluded that the antenna designs and IHT treatment delivery technique developed in this research could be used to deliver targeted IHT to the cervix. Furthermore, the proposed MW antennas and treament technique could be used to design combined intrauterine tandem applicator for delivering MW IHT and HDR BT to the cervix in sequential mode.\r\nPublications:\r\n	K.

The parasite uses differential gene expression mechanisms as strategies to adapt to different niches. Among them, parasites rely heavily on epigenetic-mediated mechanisms for controlling chromatin organization, gene regulation, morphological differentiation, and antigenic variation. The epigenome of P. falciparum is distinct from mammals as it has few transcription factors, thus tight regulation of gene expression largely depends on the nature of the chromatin structure in the parasite. Most of the research has been focused on post-translational modifications in the N-terminal tail of histones, the PTMs present within the globular domain are less well understood. How the PTMs in these domains affect chromatin-templated processes is not clear. Emerging reports have confirmed that P. falciparum chromatin harbors many modifications at unconventional residues. Thus, a detailed investigation of these PTMs would help in understanding the chromatin dynamics mediated gene expression changes in a human malaria parasite.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-17 09:07:28','Active'),(136,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','From complex algebra to cancer imaging â€“ a journey in medical physics ','Dr. Anand Kumar','Dr. Anand Kumar is a physicist and engineer with training in optical physics, spectroscopy, optical communications and biomedical imaging.

High solubility is attributed to the small distortion oxygen interstitials exert \r\non these metals [2]. Similarly higher solubility of C in FCC Fe compared to BCC Fe is \r\nattributed to a small amount of strain exerted by C on Fe. But C and N interstitials prefer to be \r\nat the tetrahedral position compared to the octahedral position in metals like Pt [3]. Although \r\nthe lattice parameter of Pt is much smaller than that of Ti, N prefers to occupy an octahedral \r\nposition in Ti while it prefers to occupy a tetrahedral position in Pt. This observation is \r\ncounterintuitive to the established notion, that distortion plays a major role in the stability of \r\ninterstitials. In this work, we explore the role of the distortion and electronic binding energy of \r\nboron, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon interstitials and their relative stability in the octahedral \r\nand tetrahedral, and substitutional sites in bulk and at the surfaces. \r\nWe show that distortion alone does not play a role in the preference of a site of solute \r\natoms. These results help us understand the limitations of the thumb rule (larger atoms will \r\noccupy a larger site, and smaller ones will occupy smaller sites) and the size of space available \r\nat various sites in Fe. While B follows the thumb rule, the genesis of O\'s occupation of the Octa \r\nsite lies in the strong bonding to Fe in the Octa environment. We showed that B does not bind \r\nstrongly to Fe, and its stability is dictated by distortion alone, which could explain the \r\npreference of B to segregate at large open volumes, like grain boundary. C, N, and O form \r\nstrong bonds with Fe and have strong environmental dependence. O bonding at the Octa site is \r\nstrong enough to overcome the largest distortion among various sites in bulk Fe and stabilize \r\nthere. We also show that solute atoms could not be assumed to be a hard-sphere with fixed \r\nvolume as suggested by calculated radii. We show that the size of the atom changes when \r\nplaced in different sites in Fe, this is due to different amount of charge transfer from Fe to \r\nsolute atoms. \r\nInterstitial formation energy of oxygen atoms at their most preferred site in TM elements \r\nbecome more positive, as one move from left to right in the periodic table. Interstial formation \r\nenergy is positive for Ni, Cu, Mo, W, Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Pt, and Au. As the volume \r\navailable at either octahedral or tetrahedral site in TM decreases as one move from left to right, \r\none would expect that more positive interstitial formation energy is due to large distortion \r\nenergy. But we found that oxygen prefers tetrahedral sites in Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ta, W, Re, Os, \r\nIr, Pt, and Au, where distortion energy is higher. This suggest that distortion energy alone does \r\nnot control preference for a site. In fact, for In, Pt, and Au electronic binding energy is positive \r\nat both octahedral and tetrahedral site, oxygen is stable at tetrahedral site because electronic \r\nbinding energy is less positive at tetrahedral site. \r\nWe find that adsorption energy of oxygen, on the surfaces is more negative than their formation \r\nenergies at most stable site in the bulk. This is due to both low distortion energy at the surface \r\nand more negative electronic binding energy at the surface. This is particularly important for \r\nelements that have positive interstials formation energy in the bulk. Adsorption energy of \r\noxygen on surface of all these elements is negative. This suggests that oxygen will adsorb on \r\nthe surface but will not from interstial in the bulk. This explains why metals like, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, \r\nNb, Ta forms oxygen solid solution while other TM do not. But catalytic metals like, Pt, Pd, \r\nCu, Ni does facilitate catalytic reactions by adsorption of oxygen on the surface but oxygen \r\ndoes not get absorbed in the bulk.\r\n[1] R.W. Cahn, P.

This is primarily because it eliminates the need for the traditional method of functional group interconversion and permits the direct functionalization of the Câ€“H bond.1 With this strategy, a lot of multistep synthesis processes may be reduced to single steps; that is, a molecule\'s specific Câ€“H bond could be targeted and functionalized, providing direct access to late-stage functionalization and the synthesis of several bioactive and natural compounds. Aside from additives and solvents at a specific temperature, this technique also requires an external oxidant, typically a metal-based one. In this context, Redox-neutral C-H functionalization has emerged as a powerful tool in organic synthesis, enabling the direct installation of diverse functional groups without the need for external oxidants or reductants.2 Among all these transition metals, the charm of using cobalt complexes for catalysis has substantially increased as a result of high performance at low cost, and its combination with the internal oxidant strategy has been found wide applications for annulation reactions in the last few years.3 In this seminar, the developments made in high-valent Cp*Co(III) catalysis using the redox-neutral strategy will be discussed.\r\n \r\nReferences: \r\n1.

This work culminates these research efforts to construct a comprehensive and robust surrogate kinetic model for various biodiesel fuels. In order to accurately reproduce the combustion characteristics of biodiesel, methyl butanoate, methyl crotonate, 3-hexene, and n-dodecane are chosen as surrogate components. These molecules have been chosen to replicate the functional groups found in biodiesel methyl esters. Each surrogate component is firstly validated thoroughly against a wide array of experimental studies. The kinetics of each component are improved through careful rate assignments derived from various theoretical investigations available in the literature. Subsequently, a surrogate mixture comprising these selected components is formulated by matching the functional groups of target fuels. This surrogate mechanism is used to validate the experimental data associated with various biodiesel fuels, their constituents, and methyl esters exhibiting similar functional groups to those present in actual biodiesel. The current kinetic model has demonstrated good agreement for various biodiesel fuels and its surrogates for a range of experimental studies. This comprehensive model can be reduced to obtain shorter models for biodiesel kinetics as required for specific applications. Apart from biodiesel, the surrogate components investigated as a part of this work are also suitable as representative molecules for transportation fuels with similar functional groups.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/jfe-nwhp-kns','','',1,'2024-04-20 04:42:20','Active'),(148,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Failure Mechanisms and Long-Term Performance Parameters of Galvanic Anodes for Reinforced Concrete Applications','Ms. Ananya S Ajayan, Roll No. CE21S001','M.S Scholar','Dr. Radhakrishna G Pillai â€“ Guide, \r\nDr. Piyush Chaunsali â€“ GTC Member,\r\nDr. Nilanjan Saha, OE â€“ GTC Member\r\nDr. Benny Raphael â€“ Chairperson & Head\r\n','Civil Engineering','2024/04/23 16:00','2024-04-23','yes','BSB 104 (Conference Room)','Corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete is an alarming durability issue at present. According to the NACE Impact Report 2016, 4.2% of Indiaâ€™s GDP is spent on corrosion and its associated material loss, repair, and maintenance. Less durable and hence, repeated repair interventions without considering the root cause of failure also contribute to this cost and the associated material wastage. Electrochemical repair intervention using galvanic anodes is a promising solution to prevent/control corrosion in reinforced concrete.\r\n\r\nGalvanic anodes consist of a zinc piece, an encapsulating mortar, and metallic tie wires attached to the zinc. The encapsulating mortar should have a high pH (>13.1) to facilitate the active corrosion of zinc and to dissolve and transport zinc corrosion products away from it. It should be highly porous, with interconnected pores that accumulate the corrosion products. But, with the duration of exposure, the pH reduces, and corrosion products precipitate and clog the pores. This reduces the performance (output current) of anodesâ€”leading to premature failure of the repair. Premature failure is often seen with the use of inferior galvanic anodes in the market. To improve the design of galvanic anodes, more literature on the crucial parameters affecting their long-term performance is required. \r\n\r\nThis presentation will discuss the time-dependent performance of galvanic anodes extracted from field structures of ages 3, 12 and 18 years, and in chloride and low-pH conditions.

However, the dominant line of academic research in developing countries adopts an external lens linking institutional policies and stakeholder pressure to firmsâ€™ sustainability performance (Jabbour et al., 2020). Research efforts that examine the leveraging of intrinsic organizational capabilities to enhance sustainability performance are still insufficiently systematized (Bezerra et al., 2020; Buzzao & Rizzi, 2021). Although India â€œmissed the manufacturing busâ€ and transitioned to a service-based economy, much of the ecological footprint and resource consumption has been attributed to the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\nBased on a comprehensive literature review that helped formulate the research objectives, a series of independent studies were built around the theoretical framework of the Dynamic Capability View (Teece et al., 1997) to explore and examine how sustainability capabilities can be developed in the context of the Indian manufacturing sector. Study 1 employs a case study-based design and TISM-MICMAC to gain insights into how sustainability capabilities emerge in young manufacturing firms (N=12). Study 2 utilizes a cross-sectional survey in listed manufacturing firms (N=242) to examine how incumbent firms rejuvenate their sustainability capabilities by aligning their extant capabilities under diverse firm conditions. Study 3 uses a Policy Delphi instrument, which captures consensus and dissent among multiple stakeholders, namely entrepreneurs, corporate leaders in manufacturing, and other ecosystem enablers (N=60), to investigate how young and incumbent firms collaborate to foster sustainability.\r\n\r\nThese studies provide a picture of how building dynamic sustainability capabilities require resource recombination and co-specialization, and they also advance the paradigm that capability building is too complex to be viewed as a direct linear flow. The findings from the research can provide strategic direction to managers embracing sustainability capabilities as part of their firm strategy. For policymakers, these studies can act as a guide to identifying the right policy and intervention mix to balance triple bottom-line objectives.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','SEMINAR - II (RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM)-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-i','','',1,'2024-04-20 11:02:04','Active'),(151,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Embedded devices to identify and assist the hearing impaired','Velmurugan S','Velmurugan S has been a project staff at the Assistive Tech Lab, in EE, for the past few years while pursuing his MS.

The operational demands of machinery frequently result in speed fluctuations, leading to spectral smearing, thereby compromising the efficiency of the analysis methodology. Furthermore, the intricacies of parameter initialisation often increase the complexity of the analysis methods. The present study introduces a fault diagnosis algorithm that requires minimal initialisation and operates independently of tacho-pulses. The algorithm proposed in the study incorporates Variational Mode Extraction with the Maxima Tracking Algorithm for Instantaneous Frequency estimation. Hankel matrix-based selective spectral fusion is proposed to mitigate the impact of frequency tracking errors caused by transient noise.

The selective activation of ortho-methyl C(sp3)ï€­H bond instead of ortho-C(sp2)ï€­H bond is highly challenging due to the facile formation of a five-membered palladacycle as compared with a six-membered palladacycle. However, under a prominent reaction condition and by using an external ligand we have developed [3+2] annulation of substituted aromatic acids with maleimides which leads to tricyclic heterocyclic molecules with good to excellent yields.3a The reaction proceeds via a dual Cï€­H bond activation where the first C(sp3)ï€­H activation takes place selectively at the benzylic position followed by a second C(sp2)ï€­H bond activation at the meta-position to afford a five-membered cyclic ring. Similarly, weakly coordinating aromatic amides, ketones and ester have been successfully utilized for this [3+2] annulation reaction.3b In recent years, direct Câˆ’H functionalization of aliphatic carboxylic acids without incorporating any exogenous directing groups has shown significant progress.4 Moreover, the usage of less reactive allyl alcohols in aliphatic Câˆ’H functionalization is very scarce. Therefore, to increase the scope and practical application of allyl alcohols in C(sp3)âˆ’H activation, we started our investigation with ï¢-C(sp3)âˆ’H containing aliphatic acids. The reaction offered five-membered Î³-lactones containing an alkyl ketone moiety at the Î³-position and an external bis-coordinated ligand is crucial for the success of this protocol.\r\nReferences: [1] Yang, Y.; Lan, J.; You, J.

High efficiency, wider fuel flexibility, modular design and environment friendly exhaust make SOFCs favourite for auxiliary and stationary electric power generation. However, their high operating temperatures pose challenges to material selection, structural integrity, and performance consistency. Lowering the operating temperatures to intermediate ranges (~600-800Â°C) may resolve many of these issues and also allow use of metallic interconnects instead of ceramics. Hence, metallic interconnects are crucial components for SOFCs at such operation temperatures. Chromium containing alloys such as stainless steels are preferred as metallic interconnects due to their ability to form a protective oxide layer at the operating temperatures. Ferritic stainless steels are of particular interest for this purpose. However, chromium poisoning of the cathode due to formation of volatile chromium species at high temperatures is a challenge. Oxide dispersion is known to improve high temperature properties of metallic alloys. \r\nIn the present work, oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic stainless steel (AISI430) was explored as metallic interconnects. The ODS alloys were fabricated by two routes. First, a novel fabrication method, named reverse friction deposition (RFD), has been developed to process rod samples of AISI430 into tubular shaped ODS alloy interconnect. 8 wt% Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (8YSZ) powder was used as dispersoid. Second, spark plasma sintering (SPS) was employed to fabricate cylindrical ODS alloys of AISI430 by powder metallurgy route.\r\nIn the next phase of the work, oxidation behaviour of these alloy interconnects was studied at 800 Â°C for 100 h. The RFD alloy tubular product showed growth of Fe and Mn oxides on one side (top surface) and (Mn,Cr) spinels on the other side (inner surface) in accordance with the variation of oxide dispersoids. Further, interaction of both type of formed alloys was studied with the standard composite cathodic layer, 50 wt.% lanthanum strontium manganate (LSM) and 50 wt.% 8YSZ at 800 Â°C for 100 h to study the effect of volatile chromium species on the cathode degradation. High valence Cr+6 ion species block the triple phase boundaries or sites for electrochemical reduction of oxygen in the porous cathodes causing performance degradation in SOFCs. The cathodic layer was found to be structurally and chemically stable in the ODS metallic interconnects. Except trace amounts in some samples, no massive migration of Cr across the cathodic layer was observed in our experiments.','MME Office','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/vst-dukn-yko','','',1,'2024-04-22 04:25:33','Active'),(159,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','NeoHebbian Synapses for Accelerating Online Training of Neuromorphic Hardware ','Mr. Shubham R Pande (EE18D704)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. Anjan Chakravorthy\r\nCo-Guide: Dr. Bhaswar Chakrabarti\r\n\r\n','Electrical Engineering','2024/05/09 14:00','2024-05-09','yes','ESB 244','We propose and experimentally validate a neoHebbian artificial synapse based on ReRAM devices to enable the hardware implementation of a scalable online E-Prop learning algorithm. \r\nThis synapse features two state variables - a neuron coupling weight and an \"eligibility trace\" for updating the weight.

Both experimental and computational simulations are utilized to examine this process. The experimental model consists of a partially filled annular tank with a centrally located rotating shaft. By varying the rotational Reynolds number (Re), the researchers examine the resulting gas entrainment and characterize the different mechanisms involved. \r\n\r\nThe findings reveal that the fluid dynamics within the annular region can be categorized into four distinct regimes, each occurring as the Reynolds number increases. In the first regime, which occurs at low Re, there is no risk of gas entrainment. Moving into the second regime, mild gas entrainment occurs because of the shearing at the free surface between two opposing vortices. The third regime shows a significant reduction in gas entrainment due to the weakening of the flow mechanism observed in the second regime. Finally, the fourth regime exhibits vortex breakdown at the rotating shaft, leading to a substantial-scale gas entrainment.\r\n \r\nVarious mitigation techniques, such as baffle plates, hydrophobic/hydrophilic surfaces, and porous plates, were investigated. The results indicate that a vertical porous plate with 50% porosity effectively eliminates gas entrainment.\r\n','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','Key Words: Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor; Pool type SFR; Cold Pool; Primary Sodium Pump; Gas Entrainmen','','',1,'2024-04-22 04:53:35','Active'),(161,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','A THEORETICAL STUDY ON THE CHANNEL CHARACTERISTICS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF AN UNDERWATER-TO-AIR OPTICAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM','Mr. BHOGESWARA RAO ANGARA','PH.D SCHOLR, ROLL NO: OE17D302','PROF.

Research has shown that providing external arm weight support increases the armâ€™s range of motion, and training with graduated weight support can help break abnormal movement patterns. Arm rehabilitation robots can be used for training with adaptive arm weight support, but they tend to be complex and bulky for use in small clinics or homes. On the other hand, simple and compact passive arm weight support devices do not measure arm movements to provide feedback and require manual adjustments of springs/rubber bands for deweighting the arm. To this end, we propose a simple, single-actuated degree-of-freedom robot â€“ MARS (Motorized Arm Support) that can provide adaptive arm deweighting and measure arm movements to provide gamified feedback for in-clinic and at-home use. This seminar presents the mechanical design of MARS, the algorithms for estimating human joint kinematics from the robotâ€™s data, and the characterization of its two control modes: a) Fixed Support and b) Arm Weight Support. A three-actuated degree-of-freedom mechatronic model of the human arm was utilized to characterize MARS. The results indicate that, \r\nthe arm angles can be estimated with high accuracy (median error < 2 degrees) without any external sensors, \r\nthe transparency of MARS (~6 N interaction force) is comparable with existing arm rehabilitation robots, \r\nMARS can maintain a constant interaction force in dynamic conditions and \r\nthe adaptive weight support from MARS adjusts automatically to compensate for the weakness in the arm. \r\nWith the completion of the design and characterization of the robot, the next step is to evaluate MARSâ€™ usability on stroke survivors with arm impairments. \r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/azr-rpvx-taf','','',1,'2024-04-22 05:30:40','Active'),(163,'seminar','Technical Talk','NULL','Semiconductor Innovations for the AI Era','Dr. Vijay Narayanan ','Dr. Narayanan received his B.Tech. in Metallurgical Engineering  from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (1995), and his M.S.

Tremendous progress has since been made in expanding AI applications as well as the accuracy of AI models, often by generating massive models that are trained on large datasets. However, this explosive growth in model size and the concomitant increase in required compute is unsustainable without significant semiconductor innovations across the hardware stack from materials and devices at the transistor level up through packaging. In this talk, materials advances needed to sustain continued CMOS scaling will be discussed including advanced transistor gate stacks, novel interconnect materials, and next-generation photoresists for high-NA photolithography. In addition, architectural progress in devices that harness the third dimension will be reviewed and will be shown to be critical to propel transistor density scaling. In looking beyond transistor performance, a novel non-von Neumann computational approach will be introduced that envisions artificial neural networks mapped to arrays of non-volatile memory (NVM) elements. These NVM elements act as artificial synapses and encode the weights of a neural network that execute analog compute operations in-memory, thereby enabling significant power performance benefits. It will also be shown that co-optimization of materials, algorithms and architecture is needed to unlock the promise of analog in-memory compute. Lastly, enhanced connectivity and scalability using a chiplet approach will be described to allow for seamless integration of disparate compute components.

Public DNS resolvers have become more popular as the need for reliable and secure DNS resolution increases, making them an attractive choice for IoT and embedded systems with limited computing power. However, public DNS resolvers also introduce vulnerabilities as they utilize shared public caches. The adversary can use these shared public caches to build covert communication channels to retrieve security-critical information.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate this concern, we introduce YODA, a covert communication channel that operates over public DNS resolvers. We show how confidential data can be exfiltrated from compromised systems and transmitted to a remote adversary. Unlike the state-of-the-art, YODA cleverly utilizes DNS queries for well-known domains, ensuring that the adversary\'s identity remains hidden, which makes it challenging to block YODA through domain name filtering.

If the transmit signals are in different frequency bands, they require a large overall bandwidth. Instead, a set of pseudo-orthogonal waveforms derived from the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences could be accommodated in the same band, enabling the efficient use of available bandwidth for better range resolution. In such a design, special care must be given to the â€˜near-farâ€™ problem, where a reflection could possibly become difficult to detect due to the presence of stronger reflections. In this talk, a scheme to detect multiple targets in such distributed radar systems will be discussed. It performs successive cancellations (SC) starting from the strong, detectable reflections in the domain of the Discrete Chirp-Fourier Transform (DCFT) after compensating for Doppler shifts, enabling the subsequent detections of weaker targets which may not be easily detectable. Numerical simulations corroborate the efficacy and usefulness of the proposed method in detecting weak target reflections.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/kis-zupy-jva  ','','',1,'2024-04-22 07:00:34','Active'),(168,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','2D Heterostructure-Based Nanofluids for Tribological Applications','Mr. Amel Krishnan (MM19D301)','IDRP Ph.D. Scholar, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Department of Physics','Dr. M.

Also, \r\nthere is an upsurge in electric vehicles in the global market, which requires high-performance \r\nlubricants. Such low viscous lubricants are prone to boundary lubrication and require additives \r\nto improve their friction reduction and wear resistance performance. Conventionally used \r\nextreme pressure and anti-wear additives have good tribological properties at boundary \r\nlubrication regimes. However, they are not environmentally friendly due to toxicity, releasing \r\nsulfated ash, phosphorus, and sulfur. Nanomaterial-based additives offer a potential alternative \r\nto conventional boundary additives, providing excellent tribological performance while being \r\nenvironmentally sustainable. \r\n2D nanomaterials such as graphene, boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides have a \r\nlayered structure with weak interlayer bonding and strong in-plane bonding properties. Due to \r\nthese characteristics, they possess beneficial properties for tribological applications. They can \r\neasily slide between contacts, reduce surface damage, and resist chemical corrosion of sliding \r\nsurfaces when used as lubricant additives. Experimental studies show interesting observations \r\nwhere ultra-low friction is developed when sliding occurs at 2D heterojunction interfaces, i.e., \r\nthe interface formed between junctions of different 2D materials. This is termed superlubricitywith friction coefficients observed to be less than 0.01. Such heterostructure sliding can create \r\nlower friction than individual 2D homojunction sliding owing to an incommensurate stacked \r\ninterface developed from the lattice mismatch at the heterojunctions. However, preparing \r\ndispersion-stable heterostructures in low viscous lubricants remains a significant challenge. \r\nThis study aims to develop 2D heterostructure-based nanofluids for electric vehicle \r\napplications.\r\nIn this talk, we will discuss the existing studies on the 2D heterostructure-based nanofluids and \r\nthe development of a novel MoO3-hBN heterostructure as friction modifier additives in \r\nPolyalphaolefin (PAO) base oil for boundary lubrication regime. Higher friction reduction has \r\nbeen observed for the prepared MoO3-hBN additive compared to MoO3 and hBN additives in \r\nPAO oil.

Fiber lasers have unique advantages compared to other types of laser systems including efficient electrical to optical conversion, excellent beam quality due to single transverse mode of operation and the option for power scaling through master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) schemes. Beyond kiloWatt power level, an attractive option for power scaling is beam combination of multiple fiber amplifiers. Various approaches to beam combining exist, such as spectral beam combining, coherent beam combining, and polarization beam combining. Among these, coherent beam combining (CBC) holds much promise for scaling to more than 100 beams. CBC can be achieved using either filled aperture or tiled aperture configurations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are primarily focused on exploring different coherent beam combination methods and optimization of those to achieve high efficiency and better beam quality. The phase locking between lasers for CBC has been implemented with Stochastic Parallel Gradient Descent (SPGD) algorithm with the help of on-loop phase modulators. In filled aperture-based CBC, diffractive optical element (DOE)-based combining is an attractive method due to its high beam quality and efficiency advantages. We have modeled and simulated different DOEs for various configurations and demonstrated a novel phase synchronization scheme based on minimizing higher diffraction orders in a 2 x 100 W CBC system. An alternate power scaling approach is polarization beam combining (PBC), in which nearly ideal efficiency (98%) has been demonstrated. High power CBC of a  4 x 300 W system also has been demonstrated using a DOE based filled aperture configuration.  We have also investigated the effect of different beam non-uniformities on CBC efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of scalability to achieve higher power levels, tiled aperture configuration (TAC) shows wide potential due to its simplistic design with fewer optical elements. Our efforts are focused on finding novel and reliable feedback points in the system for non-central feedback, to overcome the limitations of central lobe based feedback. We have simulated different non-central feedback point/area based phase locking methods considering the symmetry of far-field speckle patterns, and one-point based side area feedback phase locking has been experimentally validated in our 7-beam hexagonal TAC system. Additionally, we have investigated the effect of transverse phase aberrations and thermally induced pointing errors on our TAC 7 system. The potential of a dual-stage nested loop modular array configuration for further scaling while maintaining efficiency has also been explored through simulations.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/uuc-tsyr-rat','','',1,'2024-04-22 08:21:08','Active'),(171,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','A THEORETICAL STUDY ON THE CHANNEL CHARACTERISTICS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF AN UNDERWATER-TO-AIR OPTICAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM','Mr. BHOGESWARA RAO ANGARA','ROLL NO: OE17D302','GUIDE- PROF.

Also, it has become imperative to resolve conventional diesel enginesâ€™ pollutant emission and performance problems. The present research investigated the advanced diesel combustion mode of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) by retrofitting an agricultural diesel engine. The HCCI engine was effectively operated using seven biofuels: methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, diisopropyl ether, acetone, and ethyl acetate. The HCCI engine reduced carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and soot emissions by 17%, 58%, and 98%, simultaneously increasing indicated thermal efficiency by 30% maximum and 3% on average compared to the conventional diesel engine. The 3-D computational fluid dynamics simulations of HCCI combustion in the test engine were conducted to elucidate the experimental findings. The validated CFD tool was used to select the most suitable ignition improver, piston bowl shape, and compression ratio. The optimal fuel parameters for HCCI combustion control were obtained using machine learning and statistical tools. Further, a dynamic fuel blending system was developed and implemented to supply the desired fuel blends to the engine according to the load and speed demand. Overall, the research provided a sustainable, practical solution for commercializing clean-burning and high-thermal efficiency agricultural diesel engines.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/iir-qoit-gnz','','',1,'2024-04-22 12:28:22','Active'),(176,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Mpemba effect: An anomalous relaxation phenomenon','R.

Moreover, the treatment cost is one of the major factors that prevents treatment of many of these waste streams, leading to the pollution and unavailability of the water and land resources that can be utilized for production of useful commodities.  Therefore, for the sustenance of the environment and thriving of humanity, cost-effective treatment strategies are needed. Resource recovery is one of the perspectives whose adoption in our treatment philosophy can bring down the treatment cost and would augment the available resources for further utilization. In this paradigm, waste streams are not considered waste but as a repository of rich resources that can be profitably recovered. In our lab, we have been consistently working on integrating resource recovery strategies in developing the treatment processes. We are specifically working on perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) removal from aqueous streams using naturally-derived waste material as adsorbents, resource recovery from seawater desalination plant reverse osmosis concentrate, developing electrospun nanofiber air filters using food waste, phosphorus recovery from poultry litter waste and treatment of oil field wastewater (produced water). We are observing that resource recovery strategies can offer a sustainable alternative to the existing treatment methods by providing economic benefits of waste treatment and also creating an alternative source of raw materials for manufacturing processes.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','EVENT HOST: Dr Himanshu Goyal, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Madras-web confernce link','seminar23-04-2024 07:20','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar23-04-2024 07:20',1,'2024-04-23 07:20:31','Active'),(184,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Gendering the Small Town: Globalization and Representation of Women in post-2010 Hindi cinema','Ms. Sayanty Chatterjee','PhD research scholar, HS15D026','Prof. Aysha Viswamohan (Guide), Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras','HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES','2024/05/07 17:00','2024-05-07','','Google meet [Online]  Link: meet.google.com/kho-wwpd-oxg','    This research attempts to understand the representation of female identity, aspiration and desire in selected post-2010 Hindi cinema situated in Hindi-speaking small-town India, while interrogating the larger negotiation of â€˜traditionâ€™ and â€˜modernityâ€™. The study is interested in addressing the questions of aspirational social mobility among small town women in the globalized Hindi heartland. In order to understand the exploration of female sexuality grappling with the gendered construction of a small town in the larger context of modernity and the several offshoots of globalization, the work focuses on films where  â€˜the woman question(s)â€™ are addressed against the backdrop of neoliberal times.\r\n\r\n     Drawing on the theories of Arjun Appadurai, Partha Chatterjee, Laura Mulvey and Judith Butler, the research investigates the mediated constructs of global modernity and space.

However, controlling the chemo- and regioselectivity is an important consideration for the success of this type of annulation reaction due to the presence of two Ï€-components. Realizing the need for a viable synthetic transformation for selective functionalization, we have demonstrated transition-metal-catalyzed site-selective tandem annulation of 1,6-diynes with various substituted indolines, indoles, pyridones, and amides through consecutive dual C H bond activation for the synthesis of various polycyclic molecules in a highly regioselective manner.5 Further, we explored selective C-H functionalization of sulfoxonium ylide with 1,3 diynes to synthesize highly useful substituted 3-alkynelated-1-naphthol derivatives.6 In addition, we have also reported the synthesis of biologically important 3,4-dihydroisoquinolinone via Co(III)-catalyzed annulation of substituted N-Cl benzamides with various allylic coupling partners in a redox-neutral manner.7\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

Potential strategies like carbon capture, storage, and utilization have been explored to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic CO2. The current work focuses on the thermocatalytic conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals like methanol using metal-metal oxide catalysts, which can be upgraded further to hydrocarbons using metal oxide/zeolite catalysts. Cu/ZnO/ZrO2-based catalysts are widely explored for CO2 conversion to methanol due to their high activity and stability. However, experiments in the literature show high variability in the performance of the Cu/ZnO/ZrO2-based catalysts owing to differences in the catalyst structure. Additionally, a mechanistic understanding of the performance of such multifunctional catalysts is lacking due to ambiguity regarding the actual active sites. In this context, a thermodynamically consistent microkinetic model was developed by analyzing the complex reaction network and the associated energetics using density functional theory (DFT) simulations for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol on Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3. This study focuses on unraveling the role of interfaces on Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3  catalyst by detailed mechanistic investigations using the DFT framework. This study also involves evaluating the facet-dependent activity of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst on all the catalytically relevant surfaces of ZnOx/Cu(hkl) considering low indexed facets such as (111), (110), (100), (211) of Cu. \r\nThe second part of the work focuses on the influence of metal oxides on the proximity-dependent reactivity and hydrocarbon selectivity of tandem MeOx/HZSM-5 (MeOx â€“ ZnO, ZrO2, In2O3, Cr2O3, ZnZrOx) catalyst. Experimental evidence suggests ion exchange of BAS of HZSM-5 catalyst with cationic species from the MeOx. The metal vacancy formation energy on MeOx catalysts was investigated to help deduce the likelihood of ion exchange with BAS of HZSM-5. Experiments show the reactivity and hydrocarbon distribution in such cases varies for different MeOx/ZSM-5 catalysts. Mechanistic details of the modification of methanol conversion to gasoline range hydrocarbons due to the ion exchange will be investigated on the metal-modified/HZSM-5 catalyst to understand the reactivity and hydrocarbon distribution differences. \r\nOverall, this work offers a comprehensive exploration of CO2 utilization to hydrocarbons, employing first principles DFT simulations in understanding the mechanisms and reaction behavior. This work would help in developing strategies for catalyst design for CO2 conversion to value-added chemicals towards a sustainable low-carbon future.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/pdn-qkyz-hyq','seminar24-04-2024 04:35','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar24-04-2024 04:35',1,'2024-04-24 04:35:17','Active'),(190,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','â€œEXPLORING THE CONTENT DIVERSITY OF MARKETER-GENERATED FOOD POSTS ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND USER MOTIVATIONS IN ENGAGING WITH THEM.â€','Ms. CHRISTY MARIA TS, Roll no.

Marketing of unhealthy food, particularly through social media platforms, is recognized as a significant contributor to this issue. Food brands are heavily investing in social media platforms, generating a substantial volume of marketer-generated content (MGC) to enhance consumer engagement. Thus, understanding consumer engagement and its underlying motivations is paramount to comprehending consumer behaviour. However, limited research exists regarding the motivations driving consumer engagement with marketer-generated food content, particularly across social media platforms. Additionally, only sparse studies compare content types between healthy and unhealthy food brands and their impact on consumer engagement. This study is undertaken to fulfil two objectives: firstly, to examine the content diversity and engagement patterns of MGC between healthy and unhealthy food brands across social media platforms, and secondly, to explore consumer motivations in engaging with such content. The findings of this research will contribute to both theoretical knowledge and practical insights, enabling healthy food brands and policymakers to develop effective consumer engagement strategies aimed at promoting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','--web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadras/j.php?MTID=m66d5d55e9f91','','',1,'2024-04-24 04:41:06','Active'),(191,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Association in like-charged surfactant-nanoparticle systems: Interfacial and Bulk effects',' Manaswini (ch21s004)  ',' Manaswini (ch21s004)  ','Dr. Basavaraja Madivala Gurappa (Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Sumesh P Thampi (Co - Guide)','Department of Chemical Engineering','2024/04/24 14:00','2024-04-24','yes','Online','Surfactant-nanoparticle systems have been extensively studied both from a fundamental standpoint and due to their industrial relevance. While the interactions between charged nanoparticles and oppositely charged or non-ionic surfactants have been well understood, the association of similarly charged surfactants and nanoparticles in an aqueous solution still needs to be solved, and the understandings reported in the literature are conflicting. To address this issue, we undertake a fundamental study to investigate bulk and interfacial phenomena in binary mixtures of (i) positively charged nanoparticles and cationic surfactants, and (ii) negatively charged nanoparticles (of different sizes) and anionic surfactants. We find that the surfactant molecules adsorb on the surface of the nanoparticle despite similar charge leading to super-charging of particles and simultaneously driving more surfactant molecules to the interface, lowering the surface tension. This effect is more pronounced at low surfactant concentrations and is observed irrespective of size of nanoparticles and surfactant-particle combination. Further, we elucidate the important role of electrostatic interactions in the surfactant-particle complexation process by varying the pH of the dispersions. Contrary to changes in the properties of the dispersed species and interface, the presence of particles does not appreciably change the bulk property such as critical micellar concentration. Additionally, fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to gain insights into the nature of the dispersed species at surfactant concentrations higher than the CMC.','Chemical Engineering Office','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/fvp-rejc-wts','','',1,'2024-04-24 04:45:09','Active'),(192,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Food Sovereignty and the Changing Agrarian and Socio-Economic Life of Kondhs in Rayagada','MS.Abhinita Mohanty','Ph.D Research Scholar [HSD16D029]','Prof.Sudhir Chella Rajan, Guide','HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES','2024/04/25 16:00','2024-04-25','','Google meet [Online]https://meet.google.com/unw-scbb-xud.','This thesis uses a political ecology framework to examine the co-existence of swidden and capitalist agriculture among the Dongaria Kondhs in Rayagada District, Odisha, India. Political ecology is helpful in understanding the relationship between humans and nature, which is affected by power imbalances in resource distribution. The study explores the impact of capitalism and neoliberal markets on tribal food, ecosystems and the emergence of a novel expression of the global food sovereignty movement. The research reveals that the Dongaria Kondhs can navigate capitalism while preserving traditional practices, agroecology and food diversity. The study also analyses the relationships among different social classes, including Kondhs, Dalits, OBCs, and non-tribal classes, to interpret the complex interplay of class, caste, and tribe in the context of capitalist transitions. Ultimately, the research unveils the resilience and adaptation of tribal communities within the changing socio-economic and ecological landscape. It argues that a broader conception of what constitutes food sovereignty movements and necessary adaption to local realities are crucial to determine the long-term success of such forms of resistance. \r\n ','HSS OFFICE','hsoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/unw-scbb-xud.','','',1,'2024-04-24 05:18:07','Active'),(193,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Relative Freshness Stochastic Hybrid Systems Markov Chain (RF-SHS-MC) model for the study of Age of information','Mr. Y.

AoI  is the time elapsed since the generation of the latest successfully received update at the destination. Specifically, at time t, if the monitor received an update with time-stamp u(t), AoI is the random process âˆ†(t) = t âˆ’ u(t). AoI can be analyzed by modeling status update systems as queuing systems. AoI is helpful in many applications like safety alarms, autonomous driving,  stock market, remote health monitoring, navigation Maps, aviation etc.,.  In status-update systems featuring parallel servers between the source and destination, the received packets at the destination may arrive out of sequence. Such situations complicate the analysis of AoI using conventional methods.  In the seminar, we propose a novel method of defining the discrete states of the stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) Markov Chain by using the relative freshness of packets in a queuing system that makes the analysis of the SHS easier compared to conventional methods. The proposed Relative Freshness Stochastic Hybrid Systems Markov Chain (RF-SHS-MC) model has been verified for the M/M/1/1 , M/M/1/2 queues with FCFS queuing discipline and the dual queue status update system.\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/iuh-fmgg-qip','','',1,'2024-04-24 06:08:37','Active'),(194,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Mechanical Strength Characterization of Plant Fiber Hybrid Composite','Mr.Sharad Shukla (AE21S045)','M.S.

Numerical modelling of the extreme wave interaction with a floating body for fully non-linear cases has been done within the framework of Weakly Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH). SPH is a meshless Lagrangian method that has gained popularity for modelling free surface flows and fluid-structure interaction problems due to its ability to handle large deformations and complex geometries. Studying steep wave interaction with a floating body using WCSPH involves simulation of the complex fluid-body interactions with accuracy. In order to evaluate the accuracy and to improve the computational cost of SPH, variable mass particle distributions is employed. The SPH method is implemented using suitable numerical techniques, such as neighbour search algorithms, time integration schemes, and artificial viscosity formulations, to solve the discretized SPH equations efficiently. An appropriate boundary condition is defined to generate steep waves in the computational domain to represent its interaction with the floating body. The study of regular wave interaction with a floating body has also been done, to show that the variable mass particle distribution on the preselected free surface region models the wave evolution sufficiently well to compare with the experimental results and also to verify the accuracy and convergence of the numerical results.\r\n\r\n','Department of Ocean Engineering','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-24 10:03:01','Active'),(198,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Development of Formulation and Processes for Full Scale Inclusion of Nano-Aluminium in Industrial Grade Solid Rocket Propellants','Mr.Bedabrata Sanyal (AE14D414)','PhD Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering.','Prof. S R Chakravarthy - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/04/26 15:00','2024-04-26','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/yni-euod-oqk','','',1,'2024-04-25 04:27:28','Active'),(199,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Role of catestatin and its naturally-occurring variant Gly364Ser in regulating endothelial function','Kajal Rathod (BT22D006)','PhD scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Research supervisor: Prof. Nitish R Mahapatra','Department of Biotechnology','2024/04/29 15:30','2024-04-29','','BT Seminar Hall','The endothelium, which forms the inner lining of all the blood and lymphatic vessels, from the aorta to tiny capillaries, is the primary regulator of vascular homeostasis.

Deleterious modifications in endothelial physiology or morphology that impact the vasoprotective homeostatic function may lead to endothelial dysfunction (ED), which is associated with the emergence and progression of several cardiovascular disorders (CVDs) such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, etc. Catestatin (CST) is an endogenously derived peptide from the proteolytic cleavage of the neuroendocrine hormone - Chromogranin A (CHGA). Several studies by us and others demonstrated the cardioprotective roles of CST in various cardiometabolic disease states, whereas its naturally occurring human Gly364Ser variant exhibited a higher risk for hypertension and coronary disease in the Indian population. This study seeks to comprehensively investigate the differential impact of the wild-type and variant CST on endothelial dysfunction through a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches.

These techniques rely on understanding the optical properties of tissues, which are closely tied to their structure and cellular composition, enabling the detection of diseases like cancer. Mueller matrix polarimetry, in particular, stands out for its capability to offer detailed tissue information vital for diagnosing tissue diseases, leveraging the polarization nature of light to analyse how light\'s polarization changes after interacting with the sample.  However, fully utilizing its potential requires integrating AI to improve detection accuracy beyond manual interpretation. Achieving optimal AI performance requires a substantial dataset, which is challenging to obtain solely from real tissue samples. To overcome this hurdle, we propose refining the modelling of polarized light and tissue interaction by introducing heterogeneity into the sample model to closely replicate real tissue structure. By utilizing this approach, we aim to address the data insufficiency issue and enhance AI performance. Consequently, we propose a methodology that combines computational modelling, experimental validation, and AI algorithms for automated diagnosis, focusing on optimizing Mueller matrix polarimetry for detecting skin, endometrial, and breast cancer.

Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a widely used method to reduce the oxygen content of polyols. However, converting polyols into diols is challenging due to the formation of undesired by-products, especially with long-chain polyols. Selective diol formation requires specialized catalysts and precise reaction conditions. Cu-based metallic catalysts show promise in cleaving primary hydroxyl groups, while HDO on inverse metal oxide-on-metal catalysts like Pt-WOx and Ir-ReOx facilitates secondary C-O cleavage. In this context, our Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations predicted glycerol\'s C-O bond cleavage on BrÃ¸nsted acidic Pt-WOx catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere to proceed via a \"protonation dehydration\" mechanism. We showed that that the Pt-WOx interface ensures BrÃ¸nsted acid (BA) regeneration during HDO. Strong BA sites on Pt-WOx facilitate selective 1,3-PDO formation due to significant differences in primary and secondary C-O bond cleavage barriers. DFT simulations also predicted a similar kinetic preference for secondary C-O cleavage in erythritol, a longer chain molecule than glycerol, on Ir-ReOx and Pt-WOx catalysts, explaining the predominant formation of 1,2,4-butanetriol (1,2,4-BTO) and 1,4-BDO during erythritol HDO reaction.  Our simulations suggests that fine dispersion of WOx to trimeric units on Pt nanoparticles, preventing W doping and WOx and agglomeration to 3D WO3 on small Pt nanoparticles, are desirable for high BA strength. Such catalysts are expected to boost selective secondary C-O cleavage in polyols. Identifying thermodynamically stable WxOy clusters on the Pt surface and BA concentration on the WOx unit is crucial in catalyst design. However, the high computational costs of DFT restrict the exhaustive exploration space, limiting insights into the catalyst structure and hindering rational catalyst design. To overcome this, we developed and deploy a Machine-Learned-Force-Field (MLFF) driven approach to elucidate the complex structure of Pt-WOx catalyst. Additionally, an MLFF was used to investigate the complex reaction mechanisms involved in glycerol hydrodeoxygenation on Cu(111), allowing for the exploration of additional conformational space of the intermediates. This provided insights into the selective formation of 1,2-PDO through the glyceraldehyde-hydroxy acetone route on Cu catalyst. This study addresses existing knowledge deficits and could motivate the development of non-precious catalysts for selective polyol HDO.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/skw-khct-abnâ€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬','seminar25-04-2024 09:10','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar25-04-2024 09:10',1,'2024-04-25 09:10:16','Active'),(204,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Development of Formulation and Processes for Full Scale Inclusion of Nano-Aluminium in Industrial Grade Solid Rocket Propellants','Mr.Bedabrata Sanyal (AE14D414)','PhD Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering.','Prof. S R Chakravarthy - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/04/26 15:00','2024-04-26','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/yni-euod-oqk','','',1,'2024-04-25 10:13:52','Active'),(205,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','SiOx  based RRAMs for brain-inspired Computation','Mr. Sourodeep Roy (EE19D414) ','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. Enakshi Bhattacharya\r\nCo-Guide:  Bhaswar Chakrabarti ','Electrical Engineering','2024/05/16 15:00','2024-05-16','yes','ESB 244/Online','Resistive Random-Access Memories (RRAMs), among the emerging non-volatile memory technologies, have received interest as components in circuits designed for brain-inspired computation, offering an alternative to systems based on Von Neumann\'s architecture.

RP allele-specific strains and populations were phenotyped in different environments, and their relative fitness was compared. This study revealed the effect of RP alleles to differentially modulate phenotype in a genetic context and environment-dependent manner. To study the potential mechanism of phenotypic regulation, an analysis of cellular translation dynamics by SUnSET assay and polysome profiling was performed. The SUnSET assay showed that these RP alleles can differentially modulate efficiency in different environments. Currently, I am carrying our RNAseq in monosomal and polysomal fractions to identify the transcripts that are prefrentially translated by the RP alleles, leading to phenotypic plasticity.

Therefore, for the sustenance of the environment and thriving of humanity, cost-effective treatment strategies are needed. Resource recovery is one of the perspectives whose adoption in our treatment philosophy can bring down the treatment cost and would augment the available resources for further utilization. In this paradigm, waste streams are not considered waste but as a repository of rich resources that can be profitably recovered.

In this work, gas hydrate based Hythane storage and transportation has been studied with three different Hythane gas mixtures ranging in hydrogen concentrations from 8-30 % in methane. Further, to improve hydrate growth, the influence of specific chemical additives to promote the gas hydrate formation was investigated, including surfactants (kinetic hydrate promoters) and tetrahydrofuran (thermodynamic hydrate promoters). Separately, nanohybrids and biosurfactants were synthesized to reduce the foam generation during the use of surfactants. A thermodynamic study was performed for every system, followed by a hydrate growth kinetics study to understand mole consumption and induction time distributions for all the systems. Finally, hydrogen storage capacity in Hythane hydrate at a moderate pressure of 6 MPa and 274.15 K temperature has been reported. The highest hydrogen storage and faster kinetics of hydrate growth were observed with THF as an additive. Hythane gas hydrate pellets were made and stored at 1 MPa and 283.15 K for extended periods without any significant loss of hydrogen from the hydrate phase.

This type of functionalization faces a lot of challenges as C(sp3)âˆ’H bonds are ubiquitous in nature. The difficulty in selective activation of the ortho-methyl C(sp3)âˆ’H bond over the ortho-aromatic C(sp2)âˆ’H bond arises due to the facile formation of a five-membered palladacycle as compared with a six membered one.1 The only strategy to address this issue is directing group assisted transition-metal catalyzed benzylic C(sp3)âˆ’H bond activation, where an exogenous group or native directing group orients the transition metal catalyst towards the particular Cï€­H bond in a highly selective manner.2 In this research proposal seminar, a comprehensive survey on various directing group assisted Pd-metal catalyzed benzylic C(sp3)âˆ’H functionalization will be discussed along with future prospects of the Pd-catalyzed  benzylic C(sp3)âˆ’H alkylation and annulation with alkenes via Cï€­H activation.\r\n \r\nReferences: 1.

The pivotal breakthrough in isolating stable NHCs facilitated their comprehensive characterization, including the quantification of their diverse chemical and structural attributes. The pronounced Ïƒ-donor capability of NHCs, coupled with the facile modification of their electronic and steric characteristics, has rendered them a preferred option across various domains of metal-based chemistry.1 The key applications of NHC ligands lies in the area of homogeneous catalysis although, recently found suitable for the construction of metal assisted three-dimensional assemblies. These assemblies find potential applications in host-guest/medicinal chemistry, while the specially designed hetero-/homobimetallic catalysts with their cooperative potential can be used for orthogonal tandem catalysis.2 Recent studies suggest that unsymmetrical bis(azolium) salts serve as excellent NHC precursors for the construction of above-mentioned assemblies as well as hetero/homo-bimetallic catalysts as they can provide the selectivity as well as rigid platform required for fixing the two metals effectively.3-5 Accordingly, we have synthesized various types of unsymmetrical bis(NHC) precursors based on (benz)imidazolylidene and 1,2,4-triazolylidene donors to employ them in the formation of coinage metal assisted self-assembled structures as well as hetero/homo-bimetallic complexes. Utilizing these unsymmetrical ligands, several hetero/homo-bimetallic complexes have been synthesized involving various metals (IrIII, PdII, AuI etc.) and some of these complexes have been studied as effective catalysts in various tandem catalytic transformations as well as challenging hydrodefluorination (HDF) reactions. Moreover, these ligands have also been instrumental in the synthesis of unique multinuclear MI-polycarbene complexes (M = AgI/CuI/AuI). A comprehensive discussion of these catalytic processes and multinuclear molecular self-assembly will be presented during the seminar.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.	a) Huynh, H. V. Chem.

Designing electrocatalysts for the reduction of these small molecules is of prime importance in the renewable energy domain. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a slow reaction at the cathode side that limits the performance of fuel cells and metal-air batteries for a variety of power applications. The Pt/C is the best electrocatalyst for ORR [1-4]. Manganese oxide phases (MnO, Mn2O3 and Mn3O4) are rich in redox chemistry, which have been explored as non-noble metal oxide electrocatalysts for ORR [5]. In addition, manganese oxide-based electrocatalysts are known to decompose H2O2 intermediate disproportionately to facilitate 4-electron ORR pathway [6]. We have investigated manganous oxide/activated charcoal nanocomposites as potential materials for ORR activity and established a volcanic trend with 18 wt% MnO as the best composite.  \r\nHaber-Bosch process is an established energy intensive industrial process for converting nitrogen to ammonia [7,8]. The Nâ‰¡N bond activation on metal surfaces has been studied using surface spectroscopy techniques to understand the mechanism of ammonia synthesis [9]. Electrocatalytic N2 reduction to NH3 under ambient conditions is emerging as an alternative to HB process [10-12]. However, the low conversion rate, poor Faradaic efficiency and concurrent HER process are some of the drawbacks identified [13]. Introducing Lewis acidic sites in the electrocatalyst can cause preferential adsorption of nitrogen over H+ enhancing the yield and Faradaic efficiency of NH3 formation [14]. In our work, bimetallic iron cobalt borate and 2D molybdenum boride (MBene) electrocatalysts are designed and tested for N2 reduction to NH3 under ambient conditions. These catalysts have produced NH3 in higher yields with good Faradaic efficiencies. These results will be presented in this colloquium.  \r\nReferences:\r\n(1)	P. Justin, P.H.K. Charan, G.

Li-ion batteries (LIBs) play a crucial role in energy storage, leading to a significant increase in their usage and, consequently, a rise in scrap generation1. Considering the environmental consequences and the high cost of lithium and heavy metals found in spent LIBs, it is essential to pursue a sustainable and effective recovery process. Recently, Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES), a type of biocompatible solvents has emerged as a category of biocompatible solvents, offering promise as effective lixiviants for leaching applications. DES are low-melting mixtures composed of a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) in a particular ratio2. Herein, we investigated the use of DES composed of choline chloride (ChCl) and Î±-Keto Carboxylic Acids as a potential alternative to the conventional mineral acids for the extraction of metals from spent LIB cathode materials3. Adding water as a co-solvent enhances the extraction efficiency by reducing the viscosity of the system and promoting mass transfer. The presence of water alters the molecular environment of DES through the establishment of hydrogen bonds with its constituent elements. Molecular Dynamics (MD) has been employed to investigate the molecular environment of aqueous DES systems with varying amounts of water. Additionally, investigations into the physicochemical characteristics of aqueous DES mixtures have been conducted to forecast structural modifications within the DES. This is accomplished by scrutinizing the volumetric and excess thermodynamic properties of the DES: H2O system. \r\nReferences:\r\n1. P. Meshram, R. V. Jaiswal, Abhilash, C. Baiju and R. L.

Existing 3-10GHz UWB channel model parameters are adapted for 0.5-2GHz IEMI transmission and verified experimentally.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the experimental observations, we effectively detect ultra wideband (UWB) IEMI using multiband spectrum sensing techniques. We devise a system-level IEMI receiver to facilitate this detection. The frequency band is segmented into eight sub-bands, and a software-defined radio ADRV9009 is employed to downconvert and digitize each sub-band. A comparative study of receiving and combining the eight sub-bands simultaneously and in a time-interleaved manner is presented.\r\n\r\nThe challenge of receiving a high power wide bandwidth signal is addressed by designing a highly linear receiver front-end IC in TSMC 65nm CMOS to process the wideband simultaneously. First, a single-ended 1-28dB tunable attenuator matched to antenna 50-Ohms impedance drives an active balun with minimal gain and phase mismatch across the wide bandwidth (BW). Second, the output of balun is filtered and downconverted separately in eight sub-bands with 200MHz bandwidth. Harmonic mixing and crosstalk are minimized during the simultaneous processing of eight sub-bands. The fabricated prototype operates on a 1.2V supply, consuming 264mW power to output the down-converted sub-bands from the specified frequency range. Subsequently, these down-converted sub-bands are digitized and processed off-chip to retrieve the IEMI signal accurately.\r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/cow-mwzy-qnu','','',1,'2024-04-26 09:44:47','Active'),(221,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','\"Evolution of Computational Chemistry - Understanding Concept to Expediting Commercialization\" ','Dr.Rajappan Vetrivel, PoornaPrajna Institute of Scientific Research,Bengaluru&Sravathi AI Technology Private Limited,Bengaluru ','Dr. Rajappan Vetrivel, an Honorary Professor at Poorna Prajna Institute of Science\r\nand Technology, Bangalore, is a distinguished Computational Chemist.

Its natural frequency of vibration is higher than the peak ocean wave frequency. Generally, the response of the jacket structure platform is significantly small in comparison to other floating offshore structures. But the small response is good enough to generate significant stress at the joint level of jacket members. This is due to the rigid connection between the members at the joint level. In literature also, itâ€™s well-studied that the joint of the jacket structure is vulnerable to stress developed and shows fatigue damage. Further, a reduction in the response of jacket structure using conventional design procedures may have a huge financial burden. So, dynamic response control of such a structure to reduce the effect of fatigue damage at the joint of members is the most economical and practical approach.\r\nA tuned liquid column damper (TLCD) is used as a passive control device to control the response of the jacket structure. The control in response is achieved by tuning the TLCD at the natural frequency of the Jacket structure. This gives control only at the natural frequency of the structure. This way, the total control achieved is not good enough. Further, TLCD is converted to semi-active TLCD by changing the pressure at the column.  The pressure in TLCD column is governed by the frequency change in the displacement response of jacket structure. So, liquid sloshing frequency should match with real time displacement frequency. Further, the robustness of Semi-active TLCD is also shown based on a change in the nature of excitation. \r\n','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-26 12:21:43','Active'),(226,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Topological Data Analysis, Basics, Computation and Applications','Prof. Siddharth Pritam','Siddharth Pritam is a faculty member in the computer science group at Chennai Mathematical Institute.

Given a sequence of simplicial complexes (filtered simplicial complex) applying a homology functor yields a sequence/chain of vector spaces with linear maps between two consecutive vector spaces. We call such sequences a persistence module. A persistence module captures the evolution of the topology of the filtered simplicial complex. It is a dynamic variant of the classical homology theory. The theory of persistent homology has found many applications and has become an important tool in scientific investigation. Due to the huge size and large dimensions of data, computation of persistent homology has been a central challenge.

Also, it has become imperative to resolve conventional diesel enginesâ€™ pollutant emission and performance problems. The present research investigated the advanced diesel combustion mode of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) by retrofitting an agricultural diesel engine. The HCCI engine was effectively operated using seven biofuels: methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, diisopropyl ether, acetone, and ethyl acetate. The HCCI engine reduced carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and soot emissions by 17%, 58%, and 98%, simultaneously increasing indicated thermal efficiency by 30% maximum and 3% on average compared to the conventional diesel engine. The 3-D computational fluid dynamics simulations of HCCI combustion in the test engine were conducted to elucidate the experimental findings. The validated CFD tool was used to select the most suitable ignition improver, piston bowl shape, and compression ratio. The optimal fuel parameters for HCCI combustion control were obtained using machine learning and statistical tools. Further, a dynamic fuel blending system was developed and implemented to supply the desired fuel blends to the engine according to the load and speed demand.

Dumping the pollutant directly into water sources is a major environmental concern because Cr(VI) is carcinogenic, highly toxic, and can enter the food chain. The permissible limit of chromium in drinking water is 0.05 mg/L, beyond which, if consumed, may cause cancer, organ damage, or other life-threatening problems. Several methods are available to treat chromium-contaminated wastewater, like adsorption, chemical precipitation, ion exchange separation, membrane filtration, electrocoagulation, and electrochemical processes. Among all techniques, the electrochemical remediation of Cr(VI) has received significant attention due to ease of operation, no chemical requirement, and no residual contamination.\r\n \r\nCarbon derived from biomass is among the promising materials for electrochemical reduction, which is explored in different forms in this study. Moreover, biomass derived carbon acts as a suitable adsorbent, trapping chromium from the water matrix. A low-cost but efficient composite generated from water hyacinth biomass is explored for its contribution to the electrochemical reduction of Cr(VI). The combination of water hyacinth carbon, catalysts, and additives showed increased reduction efficacy due to simultaneous adsorption and electrochemical reduction.

Among DP steels, DP 980 grade steel is gaining wide acceptance. However, DP steels fail easily during stamping operations due to their poor stretch flangeability. Stretch flangeability of a material is the resistance to through-thickness crack propagation during edge stretching. Hole expansion testing (HET) is successfully used to predict tendency for edge cracking. There are various heat treatment methods available to improve stretch flangeability. The current research uses localized heat treatment of specimen edges on DP980 steel sheets to increase formability which prevents edge cracking during forming operations like the stamping process. Therefore, in the current study, techniques have been developed to improve the stretch flangeability of DP 980 steel by locally modifying the microstructure at the hole edge using a microplasma heat source. Standard HET specimens 90 mm x 90 mm square with a 10 mm diameter central hole were prepared A microplasma torch with a controlled heat input was used to locally heat treat the edge of the hole. This ensures local softening around the circumference of the circle. The hole expansion test (as per standard ISO 16630) was carried out to identify the stretch flangeability of DP 980 steel. It is found that at optimized heat input of microplasma power source, the hole expansion ratio is increased.','MME Office','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-29 04:08:20','Active'),(231,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL',' \"Palladium-Catalyzed Atroposelective Câ€‘H Bond Functionalization via Transient Directing Group Strategy â€','Mr. Arjun V(CY21D014)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-prof.

This encompasses asymmetric cross-coupling reactions, enzyme-catalyzed kinetic resolutions, asymmetric cycloaddition reactions, asymmetric transfer hydrogenations, and asymmetric reduction reactions.3 Nevertheless, the practicality of these strategies has been hampered by the necessity of prefunctionalized substrates, poor competence and limited stereoselectivity. Consequently, the requirement of peculiar and streamlined asymmetric catalytic approach to access valuable axially chiral biaryls is highly coveted. In recent years, due to the atom-economical features, the atroposelective Câˆ’H functionalization has surfaced as an innovative and a robust strategy for the expeditious acquisition of axially chiral biaryl scaffolds.4 However, despite the remarkable progress made for atroposelective Câˆ’H functionalization, the extra synthetic steps required to install and cleave the directing group on the molecules. To avoid the extra synthetic steps, the concept of transient directing group (TDG) has been developed. Encouraged by this new synthetic tool, the scientific community showed a real endeavor toward the design and use of chiral transient directing groups to achieve the highly challenging atroposelective Câˆ’H bond functionalization reactions.5 In this seminar, the recent developments made in palladium-catalyzed atroposelective Câˆ’H bond functionalization reactions by using directing group and TDG strategy will be discussed.

They exhibit several advantages, such as being flexible, low-weight, low-cost, semi-transparent, and so on.1 However, till 2017, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs were only 10%, which is way behind the PCEs of silicon solar cells (30%).2 In the last five years, the PCEs of OSCs have improved from 10% to ~ 20%, mainly due to the replacement of traditional fullerene acceptors with non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).3 Among the NFAs, molecules like â€˜Y6â€™ with donor (D) and acceptor (A/AÊ¹) units arranged in a configuration of A-D-AÊ¹-D-A are being widely studied due to their enhanced photovoltaic performance.4 However, to commercialize Y6-based OSCs, further improving their PCEs is needed. In this seminar, first we will discuss the existing methods in the literature for improving PCEs, such as replacing the core moiety, end groups, chalcogen atoms, and alkyl chain length of the Y6 molecule.5â€“8 Next, we will introduce a few crucial experimental parameters governing the PCE, namely, the open circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, and fill factor.9,10 We will show how some of these factors can be computed using first-principle calculations for donor-acceptor complexes. In this context, we will discuss the results of our recent work, where we studied the effects of replacing various moieties of the Y6 molecule, namely, the pyrrole units with phospholes,11 the terminal F-atoms with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like Cl, CF3, and NO2, and substituting S with Se, and computed the PCEs for each case using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) simulations. In general, we find that the modified acceptors exhibit red-shifted absorption spectra and enhanced short circuit current density. However, the open circuit voltage of the modified acceptors (computed using the well-studied PM6 as the complementary donor) is lower than the unsubstituted Y6, leading to only a nominal increase in the PCEs. Since all the experimental parameters governing the PCE cannot be computed from first-principles, we computed charge transfer (CT) rates between the donor and acceptor complexes, which can be measured experimentally. To compute the CT rates from first-principles, we employed both Marcus theory12 and real-time time-dependent density functional tight binding theory (RT-TD-DFTB),13 where the latter is a semi-empirical alternative to RT-TD-DFT, and it can be used to simulate the CT rates of mesoscale systems. Using Marcus theory, we were able to reproduce the results outlined in Ref 14.14 We are in the process of assessing the RT-TD-DFTB predicted rates with the experimental results. After establishing the validity of these methods, we would like to explore several donor-acceptor complexes.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n(1)	Colsmann, A.; RÃ¶hm, H.; Sprau, C.

Depending on the number of crossings, they are subdivided into 31, 41, 52, 61, etc. Albeit populating ~1% of known PDB structure1, their role in protein is still a riddle to solve. However, some initial studies propose that knots may provide protein with enhanced mechanical stability against cellular degradation2, while another proposes that it depends on the direction of degradation3. In the proposed research, we look deeply into the degradation of various knotted protein substrates by ATP-dependent proteases ClpXP and ClpAP. In our study, we found that the degradation of 41 knotted miRFP proceeds smoothly with ClpXP, while ClpAP fails to degrade it. Such behavior can arise due to knot jamming in the translocation chamber of the ClpAP protease chamber. Employing a single-molecule optical tweezers-based assay, we propose to look deeply into the mechanism of degradation by these ATP-dependent proteases, as it is impossible to do so from bulk degradation assays.\r\nIn addition, the folding mechanisms of knotted proteins are ambiguous. The fate of a knot in a folded protein remains unclear when folded domains hinder the free termini. Initial investigations show that folded proteins can form knots despite bulky folded proteins at their termini4. Although these studies provide the idea of the simplest 31-knotted protein folding, the folding of complex higher-order knots remains elusive. In the proposed research, we will explore the possibility of knot formation in such chimeric protein constructs employing single molecule force spectroscopy by AFM to detect the knots.\r\nReferences:\r\n1) FaÃ­sca, P.

The emergence of metamaterials has offered a new route to control material properties and a novel way of interacting waves with matter. Metamaterials constituting artificial sub-wavelength inclusions are macroscopically treated as a bulk material and can be characterized by a set of effective parameters. Tailoring these effective parameters by engineering the constituent artificial structures holds great promise for applications, including absorbers and polarization manipulation. The first part of the work consists of the realization of a broadband, bidirectional absorber. Subduing the inherent narrow bandwidth of absorbers is the prime goal in metamaterial absorber research, as this can widen the application areas. A more significant challenge is to construct a bidirectional absorber, which provides direction-insensitive absorption, as most of the existing designs exhibit single-sided absorption due to the complete metal film used in the design. The second part of the work explores a polarization sensitive transmission effect called asymmetric transmission, which is the property of a structure to allow the radiation to pass through in one direction while restricting it in the opposite direction. The third part of the work involves the realization of a bandwidth-enhanced, linear to circular polarization converter using a simple, planar structure utilizing chirality and asymmetry. This talk will explain the design aspects, mechanism and experimental results of these metamaterial devices.  \r\nPublications forming part of the thesis:\r\n1.  L. Stephen, N. Yogesh, and V.

Several methods are available to treat chromium-contaminated wastewater, like adsorption, chemical precipitation, ion exchange separation, membrane filtration, electrocoagulation, and electrochemical processes. Among all techniques, the electrochemical remediation of Cr(VI) has received significant attention due to ease of operation, no chemical requirement, and no residual contamination.\r\n \r\nCarbon derived from biomass is among the promising materials for electrochemical reduction, which is explored in different forms in this study. Moreover, biomass derived carbon acts as a suitable adsorbent, trapping chromium from the water matrix. A low-cost but efficient composite generated from water hyacinth biomass is explored for its contribution to the electrochemical reduction of Cr(VI). The combination of water hyacinth carbon, catalysts, and additives showed increased reduction efficacy due to simultaneous adsorption and electrochemical reduction. This work offers a facile method for complete Cr(VI) removal and proposes a reduction mechanism that helps in cell design for large-scale applications.\r\n ','Chemical Engineering Office','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkLink https://meet.google.com/fqb-zzus-rsv','','',1,'2024-04-29 05:26:04','Active'),(237,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\" Time series models with additive noise with finite- and infinite- variance distributions - statistical and AI based approaches â€œ','Mr. Sayantan Banerjee, MA19D201','Research Scholar, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','DC Members: Dr. M.

However, many factors heavily impact Wi-Fi performance, such as WLAN standards, radio capabilities, bandwidth, operating band, channel quality, interference, noise, rate adaptation, hardware, infrastructure, client type, and others. Therefore, it is crucial to understand Wi-Fi performance for effective planning and management of Wi-Fi deployment. Our work aims to study Wi-Fi performance under various scenarios through in-site measurements and develop a recommendation mechanism for real-time deployment that guarantees the desired quality of service. Our primary focus is on passive in-site experiments and measurements in Indian homes to evaluate Wi-Fi parameters at low-layer levels and comprehend their impact on performance in terms of coverage, throughput, speed, and channel utilization. This work creates a new dataset for WLAN network performance recorded from more than 15 Indian homes, performing thousands of experiments with various traffic protocols and application bandwidths in a clean and static environment. The dataset allows us to understand the performance of Wi-Fi at various layers and its effect on overall performance. The dataset also enables us to predict real-time expected throughput, retries, and coverage at Indian homes.

Several types of polymer-modified clays have been developed, and the present study focuses on the use of superabsorbent polymer to modify bentonite clay by in-situ polymerization. To address the problem of polymer elution, the response surface method was employed to formulate a new optimized polymer composition for developing polymerized bentonites. The hydraulic performance of the developed polymerized bentonite was assessed by using a newly designed constant flow permeameter. Hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted using various inundating pore fluids mimicking the field scenario. A low-cost Arduino based data acquisition system was developed to log the data during the permeation experiment. Further, the durability of polymerized bentonites under cyclic wet-dry cycles was also investigated.

Ships with limited maneuverability must find safe routes that are free from collisions well ahead of time while operating between confined waters and the open sea. In tandem with this, the development of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) for large vessels to conduct commercial activities is also gaining momentum. In this article, we bring out a methodology for operating a MASS of an oil tanker class type KVLCC2 vessel by introducing a Collision Avoidance Module (CAM) in an autopilot design. The CAM is based on a cooperative Velocity and Heading Set approach in a dynamic marine environment. It is developed to perform in compliance with the COLREGs formulated by IMO for the prevention of collision at sea. It delivers the required course and speed to be maintained considering the maneuvering characteristics of the vessel for a collision-free path. The proposed method is validated by simulating it in several conventional colliding scenarios, including head-on, crossing, over-taking and close-quarter conditions for a single target ship as well as multiple target ship encounter situations. It is observed that the vessel can circumvent the target ships and converge back to its path in a closed-loop autonomous mode of operation.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-30 02:51:57','Active'),(247,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','A novel snubber circuit and Active gate driving  technique for SiC MOSFET','Mr. Vamshi Krishna Miryala (EE14D010) ','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr.Kamalesh Hatua ','Electrical Engineering','2024/05/15 14:00','2024-05-15','yes','Online','SiC MOSFETs have emerged as the latest technology switching devices replacing Si-IGBTs in 600V to 1.7kV voltage range. Its worth noting here that SiC MOSFETs can switch five to ten times faster than conventional Si-IGBTs. So extracting the full switching potential of SiC MOSFETs is still a challenging task. The current work proposes a simple passive snubber that enables SiC MOSFETs to switch at its full speed. It also recovers the switching losses in SiC MOSFET with the help of layout inductance present in the converter. The performance of the proposed snubber method is verified in boost converter setup at various loading conditions and its  performance is found to be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, current work also discloses an active gate driving technique to series connect multiple SiC MOSFETs. Series connection of SiC MOSFETs enables power electronic designers to provide the benefits of SiC MOSFET technology to medium voltage converter applications as well. The proposed active gate driver (AGD) is designed to reduce turn-off losses and achieve voltage balancing even in the presence of moderate gate pulse delay mismatches.  The proposed gate driving technique is verified in hardware setups that had  SiC MOSFETs connected in series.\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/zwh-pjag-vpg','','',1,'2024-04-30 04:38:57','Active'),(248,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Metamaterial based devices for microwave applications','Ms. LINCY STEPHEN, (PH13D006)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide: Dr. Subramanian V','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/04/30 16:00','2024-04-30','yes','https://meet.google.com/qvy-qpej-hyc','The human quest for understanding material properties and manipulating them for various applications dates back to ancient times. The emergence of metamaterials has offered a new route to control material properties and a novel way of interacting waves with matter. Metamaterials constituting artificial sub-wavelength inclusions are macroscopically treated as a bulk material and can be characterized by a set of effective parameters. Tailoring these effective parameters by engineering the constituent artificial structures holds great promise for applications, including absorbers and polarization manipulation. The first part of the work consists of the realization of a broadband, bidirectional absorber. Subduing the inherent narrow bandwidth of absorbers is the prime goal in metamaterial absorber research, as this can widen the application areas. A more significant challenge is to construct a bidirectional absorber, which provides direction-insensitive absorption, as most of the existing designs exhibit single-sided absorption due to the complete metal film used in the design. The second part of the work explores a polarization sensitive transmission effect called asymmetric transmission, which is the property of a structure to allow the radiation to pass through in one direction while restricting it in the opposite direction. The third part of the work involves the realization of a bandwidth-enhanced, linear to circular polarization converter using a simple, planar structure utilizing chirality and asymmetry. This talk will explain the design aspects, mechanism and experimental results of these metamaterial devices.  \r\nPublications forming part of the thesis:\r\n1.  L. Stephen, N. Yogesh, and V.

The proposed framework was evaluated using several benchmark sets from recent UAI competitions and large digital benchmark circuits.

This flexibility in system design can be utilized to incorporate several custom features. Security is one such feature that plays a crucial role in the modern era of connected devices. Ever since the era of the Internet began, the number of security breaches across computers worldwide has increased enormously. Deploying countermeasures for security threats in the hardware promises to be more efficient than the software-only counterparts. This thesis begins with a survey of the security features incorporated in hardware over the last five decades. We observe that two categories of security vulnerabilities have gained recurring attention over the years. They are, what we term as Memory vulnerabilities and Micro-architecture based vulnerabilities. Around 47% of the total works surveyed deal with Memory vulnerabilities, while around 25% of them deal with Micro-architecture based vulnerabilities. Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), a forum that ranks security threats, ranks Memory Vulnerability and Micro-Architecture based vulnerabilities among the top ten software and hardware weaknesses respectively. In this thesis, we present countermeasures for attacks from each of the two categories. We propose a framework to analyze micro-architecture based vulnerabilities over branch predictors and establish a tuneable scheme of defense to satisfy the orthogonal constraints of security and performance. In the later part of the thesis, we present solutions that thwart memory vulnerabilities that arise out of unsafe coding practices in languages such as C and C++. Our comprehensive solution for memory vulnerabilities exhibits very low performance and area overheads. All our solutions are implemented on open-source processors and verified on FPGA platforms.','CS Office','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/sij-jpdv-rex','','',1,'2024-04-30 11:28:04','Active'),(253,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','\"Computational Advancement towards Efficient Catalytic Materials: Connecting a Few Dots\"','Dr. Sudip Chakraborty, Reader F, Materials Theory for Energy Scavenging (MATES) Lab, Harish-Chandra Research Institute (HRI) Allahabad, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), India','Dr. Sudip Chakraborty is leading Materials Theory for Energy Scavenging (MATES Lab)\r\ngroup(http://www.hri.res.in/~sudipchakraborty/) in Indiaâ€™s premier theoretical research Institute Harish-\r\nChandra Research Institute (HRI) Allahabad (Prayagraj), Department of Atomic Energy, Govt. of India.\r\nAfter completing his Ph.D. in collaboration between Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and\r\nUniversity of Pune, India, he moved to Max Planck Institute, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany in March, 2011 as a Max\r\nPlanck Postdoctoral Fellow.
