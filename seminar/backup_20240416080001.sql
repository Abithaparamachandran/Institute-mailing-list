The quantum\r\nextremal island method investigates the information paradox within lower-dimensional\r\nGaussâ€“Bonnet gravity, specifically focusing on a three-dimensional EGB black hole.\r\nAlso, we employ the island prescription to explore the information paradox within\r\nnon-AdS spacetime, specifically in the context of warped Anti-de Sitter black holes. We\r\nare examining eternal black holes which do not undergo evaporation. These black holes\r\nare connected to an external reservoir, facilitating the radiation reaching the boundary.\r\nThrough this process black holes can completely evaporate and disappear. The results\r\nindicate that initially, the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation exhibits a linear\r\ngrowth with time, eventually becoming unbounded later. However, when accounting for\r\nthe emergence of an island later and just beyond the event horizon, the growth in the\r\nentanglement entropy of Hawking radiation stabilizes at a constant value. This constant\r\nvalue is precisely twice the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We also examine the Page time\r\nand the Scrambling time and their dependence on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second part, we examine a quantum field propagating within a spacetime generated\r\nby a specific Z2 quotient of the BTZ black hole. We investigate how the presence of the\r\nmatter field influences the spacetime geometry, considering linear perturbations in the\r\nmetric. The exact computation of the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor is\r\nachievable by evaluating its pull-back onto the covering space. By selecting appropriate\r\nboundary conditions for the quantum field along a non-contractible cycle of the quotient\r\nmanifold, it becomes feasible to achieve a negative average energy along a null geodesic,\r\nforming a traversable wormhole.\r\n','HoD Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-03 06:19:05','Active'),(3,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\"Carbone [(L)2C(0)] Based Complexes Towards Dinitrogen Activation and Catalysisâ€','Ms. Madhuri Bhattacharya (CY21D094)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide- Dr. Kartik Chandra Mondal, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/08 15:00','2024-04-08','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','Nitrogen fixation by the reduction of N2 to NH3 is a requisite transformation for life. This can be done on a vast scale by the industrial Haberâ€“Bosch (HB) process using Mittasch catalyst at very high temperature (300ËšC) and pressure (100 bar), but in nature by nitrogenase enzymes present in certain micro-organisms under ambient conditions. Researchers have attempted to mimic nitrogenase, but due to the complex mechanism of N2 activation and inertness of N2, have met with limited success[1]. \r\nFor N2 activation, metalâ€“N Ï€-backbonding plays a crucial role. Higher the electron density on the metal, higher will be the backbonding. In this regard, carbone [(L)2C(0)] having two lone pairs of electrons, is a strong Ïƒ- and Ï€-donor ligand enhancing the electron density on the metal. Now carbodiphosphorane (CDP) is a particular type of carbone where L = phosphine. Although there are several works on expensive late transition metal and coinage metal carbone complexes[2]; early transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni) complexes, which are comparably cheaper, remain challenging to synthesis due to instability. Here I will be proposing different CDP ligands based 3d-transition metal complexes which can be implemented for N2 binding as expected from the theoretical calculations done by our group. Such strong electron donor ligands can stabilise coordinatively unsaturated metal centers, promoting catalysis[3]. In this seminar, an extensive presentation of carbodiphosphorane chemistry and itâ€™s metal complexes synthesized to date will be discussed, followed by my work done and the future perspective.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

For example, developing a new drug costs an average of 2.6 billion U.S. dollars and takes approximately a decade. Traditional computer-aided drug design methods are still ineffective due to the enormous size of the chemical space of drugs (estimated to be in the order of $10^{60}$) to be explored. Moreover, successfully designing a molecule for a particular context is just one piece of the puzzle. Once a potential lead molecule with optimized properties is generated, to realize its full therapeutic potential, a robust, economical, and sustainable pathway for synthesizing the molecule must be designed for practical application. Recent successes of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in different domains encourage us to investigate domain-specific generative and multimodal AI\'s role in solving the ``De-Novo Drug Discovery\" and ``Novel Reaction Pathway Discovery\" problems. In this presentation, we discuss our approach to addressing the prediction of drug properties, molecule generation, and synthesis pathway design, leveraging the power of AI in conjunction with domain knowledge. By harnessing various biochemical modalities such as sequences, 3D structures, and pathway networks, our method allows us to improve the pace of drug discovery and facilitates the sustainable production of a broader spectrum of compounds. We will highlight results from our work on developing chemistry-inspired interpretable representations for molecular property prediction and a de-novo molecule generation framework using Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we explore the integration of multiple biological modalities and capitalize on their synergies for synthesis pathway generation.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-04 03:44:01','Active'),(11,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Design, optimization, and experimental verification of superficial hyperthermia treatment of cancer using near-field microstrip patch antennas and ultrasound tissue thermometry.','Mr. Muthu Rattina Subash, ED19D700','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Engineering Design.','Dr.   Nilesh J Vasa (Chair)\r\n\r\nDr. Kavitha Arunachalam  (Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Arun K Thittai, AM (Co-Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Tuhin Subhra Santra,\r\n\r\nDr. M Ramasubba Reddy, AM','Department of Engineering Design','2024/04/04 15:00','2024-04-04','','ED107 ( Cybernetic Center)',' Hyperthermia is an adjuvant cancer treatment that elevates tumor temperature to 40-\r\n45 â„ƒ for 60-minute duration.

These low-dimensional materials exhibit a strong Coulomb interaction owing to reduced dielectric screening, resulting in stable excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) at room temperature [1,2]. In this work, we have studied the 2D oxide material Î±-MoO3 and its heterostructure with other TMDC materials. Our primary objective is to investigate many-body complexes, such as excitons and trions, for excitonic-based device applications. The Î±-MoO3 is a unique 2D oxide semiconductor that has recently gained immense potential in the field of optoelectronics because of its high workfunction (~6.0â€‰eV) and band gap (~3.0 eV) [3]. A large workfunction enables spontaneous electron transfer from most 2D materials to Î±-MoO3 in a heterostructure design, making Î±-MoO3 a viable candidate for designing self-driven photodetectors and hole transport layers in solar cells [3]. Our initial study was devoted to examining the charge transfer in the Î±-MoO3/MoS2 heterostructure and the subsequent formation of positive trions composed of one electron and two holes at low temperatures [4]. These trions are electrically controllable and contain information about energy, charge, and spin  [1]. In the next part of the work, we utilized H+-ion irradiation to tune the photoluminescence (PL) emission of Î±-MoO3 in a visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum  [5]. In addition, we have observed that the as-grown Î±-MoO3 crystals exhibit strong in-plane Raman anisotropy due to their low symmetric crystal structure. Furthermore, in-plane Raman anisotropy has been characterized by angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy, and the degree of anisotropy in Î±-MoO3 is quantified, which will be helpful for designing polarization-sensitive photonic devices. In the Final part of the work, we demonstrated the selective tuning of memristive characteristics of Î±-MoO3 through synthesizing two distinct single crystal types (referred to as type-I&II) using the physical vapor deposition technique.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1]	T.

Local scour around piers is a major cause of bridge failures. This research aimed to study the effect of (i) pier shape, (ii) footing geometry on local scour depth, and (iii) the flow field, turbulence, and scouring around different-shaped piers. The effect of pier shape on the scour depth is investigated using circular (M1) (diameter, D = 5 cm) and two modified pier shapes (M2 and M3), where M2 is a combination of semi-circle and triangle oriented either way (M2a and M2b), and M3 is a further modification to M2a with a small protrusion on the semi-circular end. The results showed that the scour depth for M2a, M2b, and M3 piers is reduced by 23.5%, 50%, and 55% compared to the M1. However, the scour depth increases if a skew angle is imposed. Also, tests with the piers in tandem showed that M1 as front pier and M2a as rear pier spaced at 1.0D, and M1 as rear pier and M3 as front pier spaced at 1.75D produced the least scour depths. The sensitivity analysis shows skew angle and flow velocity are the most influential parameters.\r\nBridge foundations can be exposed to flow due to long-term riverbed degradation, which affects the scour around compound piers. Experiments are conducted using a compound pier with pier diameter D and footing diameter (Df = 2D) located at different elevations. The footing at or just below the riverbed reduced the scour depths up to 57% than the pier alone, while those projecting into the flow aided scouring. Footing diameter and flow depth are the key parameters influencing scour depth prediction. Further, flow field, turbulence, and scouring around different-shaped piers are studied through 3-D velocity measurements, revealing the shielding effect of footing from the impact of downflow and horseshoe vortices in reducing scour depth around compound piers. The distribution of velocities, Reynolds shear stresses, turbulent kinetic energy, vorticity, and bed shear stresses around each pier model are studied. The developed M5 models for estimating scour depth around different-shaped piers are accurate (R2 > 0.85) than existing scour equations. This research proposes efficient pier shapes for scour reduction and contributes to safe bridge designs.','G Mathangi','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-04 12:21:03','Active'),(47,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Dynamics and control of an underwater glider','Mr.Kumar Vaibhav, Roll No: OE21S002','Mr.Kumar Vaibhav, Roll No: OE21S002, MS Scholar.','Guide: Dr. Suresh Rajendran, Department of Ocean Engineering.','OCEAN ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT','2024/04/05 16:00','2024-04-05','','Seminar Hall, Department of Ocean Engineering','The research is divided into two main sections.

To achieve path following of an underwater glider (taken as a point mass model), a virtual target method is used. The primary objective of path following is to obtain control inputs that allow the glider to converge to the desired path with high accuracy and minimum control input. To achieve this, the path following problem is first converted into an optimal control problem, and a pseudo-spectral (PS) framework is employed to solve it. Finally, the study concludes with the implementation of control inputs derived from the PS framework into a 6 DOF glider model.','OCEAN ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-05 03:30:28','Active'),(48,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','A Systematic Analysis of the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 Using Uncertainty Quantification','Hariharan R K (ch21s006)','Hariharan R K (ch21s006) MS Scholars','Guide : Dr. Himanshu Goyal','Department of Chemical Engineering','2024/04/05 17:00','2024-04-05','yes','online','\r\nA Systematic Analysis of the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 Using Uncertainty Quantification\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nElectrochemical reduction of CO2 has emerged as a promising technology to combat climate change. Despite significant advancements in catalyst materials and electrolyzer optimization, translating this progress into practical applications is challenging due to the system\'s complex multiphase and multiscale nature, particularly under industrially relevant conditions. To develop more accurate models, accounting for uncertainties in the physical system is crucial, ranging from estimating kinetic parameters to biases in transport parameters. In this study, we perform uncertainty quantification of an electrochemical cell model validated against experimental data. We explore the uncertainties associated with the input model parameters and compare them with the experimental measurements, assessing the reliability of the model predictions. Our analysis also sheds light on the contribution of different parameters to the variation in current density predictions, which can help build confidence in the model. By quantifying the biases and uncertainties in model parameters, we can develop more accurate models, which could accelerate the translation of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into practical applications.\r\n\r\n','K P GEETHA','choffice','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/nmq-khdy-avs','','',1,'2024-04-05 05:04:24','Active'),(49,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Optimization of utility-based shortfall risk: A non-asymptotic viewpoint','Mr. Sumedh Sunil Gupte, Roll No: CS21D014','Ph.D. Research Scholar','Dr. Sutanu Chakraborti - DC Chair,\r\nDr. Prashanth L A - Guide,\r\nDr. Sanjay P Bhat - Co-Guide - EE,\r\nDC Members:\r\nDr. Mitesh Khapra - CSE,\r\nDr. Harish Guruprasad - CSE,\r\nDr. Abhishek Sinha - EE.','Computer Science and Engineering','2024/04/10 11:00','2024-04-10','','A M Turing Hall (SSB 334, Second Floor)','We consider the problems of estimation and optimization of utility-based shortfall risk (UBSR), which is a popular risk measure in finance.

Next, in the context of UBSR optimization, we derive an expression for the UBSR gradient under a smooth parametrization. This expression is a ratio of expectations, both of which involve the UBSR. We use SAA for the numerator as well as denominator in the UBSR gradient expression to arrive at a biased gradient estimator. We derive non-asymptotic bounds on the estimation error, which show that our gradient estimator is asymptotically unbiased. We incorporate the aforementioned gradient estimator into a stochastic gradient (SG) algorithm for UBSR optimization.

Hydrogen is one of such alternatives; however, it will be environmentally and economically sustainable only when it is generated by using a renewable source such as solar energy. The photoelectrochemocal approach of generating hydrogen from splitting of water is an attractive option provided the photoative materials yield optimum efficiency of light absorption, photocarrier generation and reaction kinectics. In practice, no single material can achieve the desired qualities and hence the heterojunction approach has been investigated. In the proposed work, heterojunction between two metal oxide components will be fabricated in such a way that the resulting material configuration not only achieves a desired alignment of the energy bands (to help charge seperation) but also yield a high specific surface area for enhanced catalytic activity. Metal oxide nanostructures will first be fabricated using chemical techniques followed by the deposition of an overlayer with Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) technique. The basic characterization for crystallinity, microstructure, morphology, composition and optical and electronic properties will be discussed. Finally, specific investigation proposals for the heterojunction and water splitting experiments will be presented.

This is \r\nachieved through strategic utilization of transformation-induced plasticity associated with \r\nretained austenite. Hence, ensuring precise tailoring of retained austenite content, morphology \r\nand size is crucial for Q&P steels. The current research work introduces a novel processing \r\ntechnique involving a combination of hot rolling and a direct quench and partitioning \r\ntreatments to produce an ultra-high strength, low-carbon and lean-composition steel with \r\nsuperior mechanical properties and enhanced stretch flangeability. The methodology involves \r\nthe introduction of a secondary partitioning step after a one-step direct quenching and \r\npartitioning (DQP) process. A detailed investigations on microstructures, tensile properties and \r\nstretch flangeability (using hole expansion testing) were carried out. The martensite-austenite \r\ntwo phase microstructure resulted in a remarkably improved product of strength and elongation \r\n(PSE, 24 GPa.%), the hole expansion ratio of 45% and a total elongation of 21.7%. It is shown \r\nthat the stability of retained austenite, rather than its volume fraction, has a significant impact \r\non the strain hardening rate, and therefore influences strength, ductility and stretch \r\nflangeability. The results indicate that tailoring retained austenite stability is essential for \r\noptimizing the mechanical performance and stretch flangeability of quenched and partitioned \r\nsteels. Introducing secondary partitioning into the Q&P process provides a feasibility to \r\nachieve a large fraction of total retained austenite, (predominantly film-type, along with smallsized blocky retained austenite islands in the microstructure), which results in high-strength \r\nQ&P steels with excellent global and local formability.\r\nKeywords: Quenching and Partitioning Steels; Austenite; Formability; Secondary \r\nPartitioning; Stretch-flangeability','MME Office','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-05 08:21:07','Active'),(52,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Reframing Childhood: Figuration of the Child in American Independent Cinema','Mr. Arjun Anil Bhaskar.','Ph.D Research Scholar, HS20D002','Prof. Aysha Viswamohan (Guide), Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras.','HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES','2024/04/24 17:15','2024-04-24','','Online  [Google meet.google.com/qji-wbaj-efq]','This research investigates the representation of childhood in contemporary American Independent cinema and reimagines the pluralities in the portrayal as a form of resistance towards the totalizing narratives of childhood in America.

Within the American cultural imaginary, particularly mainstream Hollywood, the distinction given to childhood has become ubiquitous, creating â€˜hyperrealâ€™ idealizations of innocence, vulnerability, and dependency, with children often perceived as embryonic adults.\r\n\r\nDrawing on the theories of Baudrillard, Bourdieu, Jameson and Butler, the attempt is to deconstruct the representational strategies underpinning the depiction of the child image in select filmic texts.

Furthermore, this research aims to discern the multifaceted modalities through which Independent cinema engages with and reimagines the child subject within the evolving cultural landscape of America.

This study focuses on a divergent 2-stage supply chain encompassing a distributor and multiple retailers. Unfulfilled demands at the retailer are considered lost sales, while unmet demand is considered backordering at the distributor. The objective is to identify the optimal continuous review inventory ordering policy for a multi-period problem integrated with routing strategies, aiming to maximize the Total Supply Chain Profit (TSCP) over a finite planning horizon. This research incorporates real-world complexities in perishable products inventory management, such as demand uncertainty, price-dependent demand, markdown prices, and inventory rationing. A hybrid continuous review (s, S, $\\beta$, Q) inventory policy, commonly used in blood inventory management, is proposed for other perishable products such as fruits, vegetables, and dairy products and benchmarked against established continuous review policies, including (s, Q), (s, S), and (s, S, q, Q), all integrated with inventory routing. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid policy surpasses classical and hybrid continuous review policies regarding total supply chain profit when combined with routing and other complexities. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis explores variations in results with changing model parameters, such as time horizon, product shelf-life, demand distributions, and lead-time settings.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','MS SEMINAR-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-05 13:42:32','Active'),(55,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','When surfaces matter: how nano-scaled surface features effect macro-scale transport','Prof. Gary Rosengarten, Mechanical Engineering at RMIT, Australia','Professor Gary Rosengarten is Director of the Sustainable Technologies and Systems Enabling Impact Platform at RMIT University, and leader of the Laboratory for Innovative Fluid Thermal Systems in Mechanical Engineering.\r\n\r\nBefore deciding on an academic career, he spent 3 years at Australiaâ€™s National research laboratory, CSIRO, and 2 years as an Engineering consultant in sustainable building design.\r\n\r\nHe completed a double honours degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering at Monash University and a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the University of New South Wales.\r\n\r\nHe applies his research expertise in thermofluids and energy systems, to help solve a wide variety of problems, particularly in energy storage, solar energy, thermal control, energy efficiency, and biosystems, working closely with interdisciplinary teams from academia and industry.\r\n\r\nHe has developed solar absorbers using radiative selective surfaces and is one of the pioneers of solar spectral splitting using vo','Host Faculty: Prof. Arvind Pattamatta, ME, IITM','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/04/08 15:00','2024-04-08','yes','Hybrid Mode: MSB 211 & through Google Meet link:- https://meet.google.com/vkv-qoct-mzw','Typical heat transfer correlations or surface property data assume that surfaces are smooth or that they donâ€™t affect transport properties such as convection or radiation. \r\nHowever micro to nano-scaled features can have a massive effect on many  macroscale continuum transport properties.\r\nIn this presentation I will showcase some of our work on a simple and cheap chemical method to create superhydrophilic copper surfaces that we apply to copper foams to significantly enhance capillarity- primary for heat pipe wicks,   surface metamaterials for selective solar thermal absorbers and superhydrophobic surfaces for enhanced spray cooling heat transfer rates.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/vkv-qoct-mzw','','',1,'2024-04-08 01:33:27','Active'),(56,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Evaluating Critical Influencing Factors for Indiaâ€™s Transition to a Gas based Economy Using Multi-Agent Supply Chain Models','MR.

The \r\nAsia-Pacific region accounts for almost 65% of the global LNG demand. There was a 4.5% \r\ngrowth in global LNG consumption in 2022 compared to 2021. A substantial increase in NG \r\nconsumption is forecasted in China and India at 7% and 4%, respectively, compared to the \r\n2022-2023 levels. Further, to ensure energy security3, it is imperative to plan investments and \r\nestablish a gas supply chain (SC) infrastructure based on the forecasted end-use uptake. Thus, \r\nhere we seek to develop a systematic framework for planning gas SC infrastructure to \r\nenable large developing countries like India to plan optimal national-level supply chain \r\nnetworks for natural gas. \r\nExisting energy transition literature emphasizes the role of government policy and \r\ntechnological innovation, while little has been written to integrate â€œtop-downâ€ approaches \r\nencompassing government policy and â€œbottom-upâ€ individual enterprise-level decisions. \r\nTherefore, here we develop a hybrid top-down, bottom-up production-consumption model \r\ntowards intra-national energy transition planning using a decentralized agent-based approach, \r\nincluding a detailed geographic coverage utilizing GIS to map individual energy units. This \r\nenables the SC-level dynamics of end-users to be considered when pursuing economic \r\nobjectives subject to regulatory constraints.  \r\nThe NG supply chain comprises natural gas production sites, floating storage and \r\nregasification units (FSRUs), and LNG import and regasification terminals as the suppliers, \r\npipeline grids supplemented by virtual pipelines based on road or rail transport as \r\ninfrastructure, and end-users who use gas as fuel or feedstock as the consumers. In large \r\ncountries such as India, estimating the demand for NG would necessitate estimating the landed \r\nprice of gas for each end-user. A key component of the landed price is the supply chain cost, \r\nwith significant spatio-temporal dependence. Gas pipelines are the cheapest means to transport \r\nNG over long distances but are economically viable only for large quantities. Road and rail\r\nbased virtual pipelines have higher unit shipping costs. However, they are economically \r\nattractive for smaller demands and shorter distances. This intricate interplay between \r\n1 \r\ndemand and economics of NG makes planning the supply chain at the national level a \r\nchallenging yet critical problem for developing national policies and studying related \r\neconomics.  \r\nThe proposed methodology comprises two distinct models â€“ an agent-based \r\nProduction Consumption Model (PCM) to assess the spatially distributed demand for NG \r\nand an Infrastructure Planning Model (IPM) to estimate the logistics costs of transporting \r\ngas from the various supply nodes to the demand centers. NG suppliers (LNG regasification \r\nterminals and NG production facilities) and end-users are distributed spatially and, along with \r\nlogistic providers, are modeled as rational, self-interested decision-making entities in PCM. \r\nEach end-user agent may desire to switch to an alternate fuel at a future time, subject to \r\navailability, affordability, and national environmental regulations. Capital expenditure on \r\nbuilding pipelines is estimated through the IPM, considering factors like geographic location \r\n(e.g., presence of terrains and water bodies).  \r\nIn this work, we present the application of the integrated simulation-optimization model \r\nin estimating demand for NG from 2022 to 2042 across Pan India, along with planning the \r\nnecessary infrastructure to meet the demand. The model comprises over ~2100 spatially \r\ndistributed end-users, including large power plants, refineries, fertilizer units, petrochemicals, \r\nas well as city gas distributors across various urban centers. The spatiotemporal demand and \r\nSC infrastructure evolution of NG arising from these end-users\' decisions over the 20-year \r\nhorizon are estimated by the model for different market and policy scenarios. Our results \r\nfeaturing natural gas usage across India suggest the power and city gas sectors to be the \r\nconsistent demand drivers, with their share rising from ~40% of the total in 2022 to ~60% by \r\n2032. This is consistent with IEA and IRENA projections.  The proposed agent-based model \r\nthus provides multiple benefits: It enables the identification of key sectors driving the \r\nenergy transition; it helps analyze critical factors like resource availability, supply chain \r\ninfrastructure, and economics; and it can be used to develop decision support tools to \r\ninvestigate clean energy policies. \r\nKeywords: production-consumption model; supply chain dynamics; technology switch; clean \r\nand low carbon fuel; strategic decisions ','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/sco-xuwj-tcp','seminar08-04-2024 03:32','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar08-04-2024 03:32',1,'2024-04-08 03:32:46','Active'),(57,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','â€œSCREENING OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLASTIC WASTES TO EVALUATE RESOURCE RECOVERY POTENTIAL THROUGH ANALYTICAL PYROLYSIS','MR.

Among various anthropogenic waste materials, plastic waste has been a promising source of energy and feedstock recovery, and their conversion into valuable fuels and platform chemicals can promote sustainable management and utilization of plastic solid wastes and circular economy. Ocean debris comprises 80% of plastic waste which also can be used as a source of energy and feedstock recovery. The present study aims at collection of beach plastic wastes from the sea shore in Chennai, India, and characterizations are done to determine their composition and polymer types. The quantification of pyrolysis vapours (pyrolysates) was carried out to determine the resource and monomer recovery potential in perspectives to petrochemical industries. Moreover, the study is also focused on in-depth characterization of post-consumer multi-layered plastic packaging waste (MLPW) by various methods such as thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, bomb calorimetry, proximate and ultimate analyses. Further, based on the chemical composition of the MLPW, its non-catalytic pyrolysis and zeolite-catalysed pyrolysis was studied. The activity of various conventional zeolites is evaluated and the salient process conditions like pyrolysis temperature and feed-to-catalyst ratio are optimized for the maximum yield of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) in the pyrolysates.

In this seminar, we explore leveraging the spatial cues in sound and vision to solve two problems:  generating immersive binaural audio for videos and 360Â° depth estimation.\r\n\r\n     In the first part of the seminar, we explore the problem of generating binaural audio (two-channel) for videos, even if they only have regular monaural (single-channel) audio. These binaural videos provide a more immersive video experience for users. Such videos are more immersive, enhancing user experience. Here, we tackle a more difficult version of this problem by synthesizing binaural audio for a video with monaural audio in a weakly semi-supervised setting (in the absence of a lot of annotated data).  Our approach relies on using any downstream task that requires binaural audio as a proxy for supervision, reducing the need for explicit supervision. In this work, we use Sound Source Localization with only audio as a proxy task for weak supervision. Using this proxy task as supervision, we leverage the visual cues to understand where sounds are coming from in the scene and infuse them into audio to create a realistic 3D audio effect. \r\n\r\n    In the second part of the seminar, we explore how sound, along with RGB images, can be leveraged to improve the depth map of the scene. We experiment with echoes, which are sound reflections from the environment. Given that the echoes encode room geometry, it is possible to reconstruct the 3D room geometry, thereby depth, from echoes. We investigate how echoes, along with limited camera views, can be used to create a complete 3D depth map of a surrounding environment. This technique enables us to estimate 360Â° depth perception with limited camera views and gives spatial awareness even if we can\'t see everything around us. Our experiments demonstrate that echoes can significantly improve depth estimation accuracy, particularly for 360Â° cameras. Furthermore, the use of audio-visual information together provides a complementary approach to estimating 360Â° depth maps with limited information.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/eia-gxsb-tiu','','',1,'2024-04-08 08:21:55','Active'),(62,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Metal-organic framework and coordination polymer-based materials for supercapacitor applications','Mr. Tapan Kumar Ghosh(CY17D015)','Ph.

The framework of differential privacy renders analysis on the congregated data while ensuring that any individual\'s contribution to the dataset remains indistinguishable. Differential privacy is typically ensured by perturbation with additive noise that is sampled from a known distribution. In this talk, we will discuss an additive noise mechanism for differential privacy that adds noise sampled from a new noise density called flipped Huber distribution. It is a hybrid density that resembles Laplace in the centre and Gaussian in the tail. With a sharper centre and light, sub-Gaussian tail, this density has the best characteristics of both distributions and renders a better trade-off between privacy and accuracy than other existing mechanisms. We theoretically analyze the proposed mechanism, and we derive the necessary and sufficient condition in one dimension and a sufficient condition in high dimensions for the mechanism to guarantee (Ïµ,Î´)-differential privacy. Numerical simulations corroborate the efficacy of the proposed mechanism compared to other existing mechanisms in achieving a better trade-off between privacy and accuracy.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/nzo-uyzr-egc  ','','',1,'2024-04-10 04:12:05','Active'),(71,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Hybrid Stochastic Modelling of Daily Precipitation and Daily Streamflow','Ms. Shalini B, Roll No. CE15D041','Ph.D Scholar','Dr. R.G.

A unique feature of these ring systems is that they generally exhibit favourable structural and physicochemical properties. This characteristic made them appear to be appropriate functional group isosteres in place of other functional groups or ring systems. According to the study, replacing less desirable functional groups with azetidine and oxetane moieties can have a significant impact on PK/PD-related parameters. Introduction of a stable, small, and less lipophilic motif may lead to better fit in the receptor pockets, thereby blocking the active sites and enhancing intrinsic activity. Moreover, shielding nearby functional groups from chemical or metabolic susceptibility, without increasing lipophilicity. This study aims to explore the effect of replacing a large lipophilic substituent with a smaller, more polar group (i.e oxetane and azetidine) can improve metabolic stability and decrease the risk of adverse effects. Understanding these often drives both the lead optimisation and lead identification phases of a drug discovery program forward. In this contest virtual screening (VS) was performed on clinically approved drugs, including antineoplastic, anti-hyperglycaemic drugs, and NSAIDs, using AutoDock4 software for computer-aided drug screening. This analysis will help develop more potent drugs with better binding modes. Computational ADME prediction followed by synthesizing analogues and performing biological screening can yield promising results. Successful optimization of drug discovery programs requires identifying structural changes in leads that enhance potency. This study focuses on molecular modification as a strategy to identify new classes of lead compounds with superior pharmacotherapeutic activity, reducing the need for extensive synthetic work and increasing the likelihood of discovering more effective and safer medications.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-10 05:02:34','Active'),(75,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Static, dynamic analysis and prototype development using Aluminum 2024 alloy through additive manufacturing technology.','Mr. Saurabh Gairola, ED18D007','Ph.D. Scholar, Department of Engineering Design.

However, the additive\r\nmanufacturing of the additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy is scarce in literature due to its high\r\nsolidification cracking and low processing window. This is primarily due to the fact that the\r\ncomposition of the Al 2024 alloy is not well-suited for additive manufacturing. The high solidification\r\nrange of the Al 2024 alloy (135 K) coupled with the columnar grains formed in the additive\r\nmanufacturing due to extreme thermal gradient ( K/s) promotes solidification cracking along the grain\r\nboundaries in the additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy. The solidification cracking can be reduced\r\nby promoting the columnar to equiaxed transformation and by tailoring the composition that is better\r\nsuited for the additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy. The current study explores the Ti addition in Al\r\n2024 alloy as Ti has been conventionally used as the grain refining agent in the casting; however,\r\nstudies investigating the grain refining effect of Ti on additively manufactured Al alloy are scarce in\r\nthe literature.\r\nThe various mechanical properties such as tensile, hardness, fracture toughness, fatigue life, and\r\nfatigue crack growth behaviour were investigated for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) fabricated Ti-\r\nmodified Al 2024 alloy. The corresponding microstructural features were investigated with different\r\ncharacterisation techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron\r\nmicroscopy (TEM), electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The microstructural features such as\r\ngrain size, precipitate dislocation interaction, etc, were correlated with the mechanical properties of Ti\r\naddition in additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy. The fully equiaxed ultra-fine grained\r\nmicrostructure with an average grain size of 0.4 was observed in the alloy. The present work has\r\nshown that tensile strength, fracture toughness, and fatigue crack growth behaviour of the additively\r\nmanufactured Al 2024 alloy are comparable to the conventional wrought counterparts, and the yield\r\nstrength, hardness, and fracture toughness were better compared to the conventional wrought\r\ncounterparts.\r\nThe mechanical properties obtained were further utilised to design lightweight prototypes of\r\nstructural components of Al 2024 alloy for aerospace applications. The different lightweight\r\nmethodologies, such as topology optimization and internal lattice structure, were combined to explore\r\nthe maximum weight reduction without compromising the strength of the component.

However, recent studies indicate that launching rockets from offshore platforms offers greater advantages compared to land-based launches. Primarily, this approach accommodates the diverse orbital inclination needs of satellites more effectively [1,2]. Furthermore, launching rockets from the sea offers environmentally friendly space launch options by reducing the risk to populated areas in case of launch failures or emergencies. Any emissions and noise produced during launch operations are dispersed across the ocean, potentially lessening their impact on terrestrial ecosystems and human populations. Consequently, deep ocean space launches come with notable benefits such as easy environment clearance and reduced public scrutiny. Despite these advantages, sea launches present unique challenges, necessitating specialized launch platforms capable of withstanding the impulsive forces of rocket propulsion and the harsh marine environment. Therefore, a multi-utility offshore platform must be designed, serving not only for traditional oil production and exploration but also for launching rockets. Developing such platforms for seaborne rocket launches enhances the nationâ€™s space exploration capabilities and contributes to economic growth. Repurposing offshore platforms for rocket launches, makes it suitable for launching satellites for earth exploration, space sciences, and meteorology. Therefore, the present research chose offshore triceratops for its desirable response characteristics. The platform is set apart by a novel ball and socket joint connecting the deck with the buoyant legs, which provides translational dependency between the deck and buoyant legs while ensuring the rotational independence between them. Design principles and analysis methods that govern the dynamics of offshore structures, in general, and Triceratops, in particular, are well-established [3-5]. As the seaborne launch exerts dynamic loading on the platform, the present research focuses on evaluating the dynamic response and stability of the deep ocean triceratops during the rocket launch, through both numerical simulations and experimental analyses.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING ','oeoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-10 06:57:20','Active'),(78,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\'\'CONTEMPORARY WORK AND EMPLOYEE VOICE & SILENCE BEHAVIOR: A VR AND PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION\".','Ms. Apoorva Goel, Roll no.

TRC elements can be lighter in weight, since non-ferrous reinforcements have lower density and require minimal clear cover. The reinforcement in TRC is typically textiles woven using continuous filaments/yarns and aligned in the direction of the tensile stresses, thus reducing the fibre volume up to 50% than that of conventional fibre reinforced concrete (FRC). Normally, TRC systems have AR-glass textiles, made with zirconium glass, to ensure adequate durability in the highly alkaline cementitious system (pH varies from 12.5 to 13). However, AR-glass is expensive and necessities the development of TRC with E-glass, which is available predominantly due to its application in GFRP (glass fibre reinforced polymer). The challenges associated with the development of TRC using E-glass arise from its degradation in the highly alkaline environment of concrete. The replacement of cement with SCMs could be promising due to the reduction in pH and increased rate of carbonation (reduction in pH of the concrete to less than 10 after carbonation). However, the lack of understanding of the mechanisms and rate of degradation of E-glass textiles in concrete with different SCMs, which govern the long-term performance of such composites, is evident. Coating of E-glass is common in textiles and the degradation mechanisms would be different from those of uncoated E-glass and AR-glass, which are not readily available in literature. \r\nThe current study focuses on understanding the mechanism of degradation and the performance of coating against dissolution in simulated pore solution of pH 13 using microstructural analysis. Further, the degradation of coated E-glass subjected to different pH and temperature is quantified in terms of loss of its tensile strength. A correlation among the rate of degradation, pH and temperature is established. The existing binders for AR-glass and E-glass are further optimized for the replacement of cement with SCMs to facilitate higher carbonation rates, necessary to lower the pH at a faster rate, along with adequate strength. Finally, the long-term mechanical performance of the coated E-glass composites will be assessed with the developed binders (with and without carbonation) under accelerated and natural aging conditions. Also, an analytical model to estimate the service life of E-glass TRC composites by incorporating the effect of various factors such as temperature, pH, and relative humidity will be developed. \r\nThis seminar summarizes the existing knowledge on the glass reinforcement, binders and long-term performance of the composites under various factors and lists out the research gaps in the literature.

Due to their omnipresence and unique reactivity, the functionalization of alkenes has become a powerful method for constructing complex organic molecules.[1] In this context, direct chelation-assisted C-H olefination at the inert C-H bonds represents the most straightforward synthetic method for introducing the alkenyl group into organic compounds in a highly regio- and stereoselective manner.[2] Despite the remarkable advances in chelation-assisted C-H olefination reaction, most of the successful transformations are restricted to activated or electronically biased olefins such as acrylates, styrenes, acrylamides, vinyl sulfones, and vinyl phosphonates.[3] Literature reports on chelation-assisted C-H olefination with unactivated or electronically unbiased alkenes are limited due to poor intrinsic reactivity and regioselectivity issues. Despite these notable challenges, highly selective C-H alkenylation and alkylation reactions of unactivated alkenes with the assistance of various directing groups have been achieved in the past few years.[4] Due to novel breakthroughs in this area, there are still limited examples of selective C-H functionalization of olefins. Realizing the need for a viable synthetic transformation for selective alkenylation and alkylation, we have demonstrated the ortho-alkenylation of benzimidates and chalcones with unactivated olefins. [5a,b] Furthermore, we also developed the methodology to synthesize 1H-isoindole derivatives via ortho-olefination followed by aza-Michael addition. On the other hand, we have also demonstrated the Ru-catalyzed ortho-alkylation of benzamides with unactivated olefins.

A variational quantum classifier (VQC) using ultrasonic phased arrays is proposed to extract weld defect features, improving the classification accuracy due to simultaneous qubits. The VQC is trained using a simulation-assisted weld dataset generated using finite element (FE) models and deep convolution generative adversarial networks (DCGAN). The total focusing method (TFM) weld images of porosity and slag are generated using time-transmitted signals received by performing full matrix capture and modeling various defect morphologies using FE simulations. These datasets are then fed to train a DCGAN to generate synthetic TFM images. A feature selection method is used to obtain the best results with a quantum circuit with minimal qubits. Prominent features obtained are supplied to the encoder circuit of the VQC to convert it to a quantum domain, thereby passing to an ansatz circuit to train quantum hyperparameters. The loss is computed for every iteration by optimizing the learnable parameters of the VQC. The VQC is trained by varying quantities of datasets to improve the reliability and efficiency of the weld defect classifications. It is found that VQC, with an accuracy of 96%, outperforms some of the classical machine learning algorithms.\r\n\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkThrough Zoom Meeting Link: https://us05web.zoom.us/j/8582580759?pwd=N0VXMEtlbFNNQ','','',1,'2024-04-11 15:37:43','Active'),(87,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Bio-ionic liquids based soft and adhesive Film for therapeutic applications','Kumari Kiran (BT21D124)','PhD scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Prof. Sanjib Senapati','Department of Biotechnology','2024/04/15 14:30','2024-04-15','','BT Seminar Hall','Bio-ionic liquids, often abbreviated as Bio-ILs, are a class of ionic liquids designed specifically for use in biological or biomedical applications.

The battery serves as the energy source in an electric vehicle due to its high energy density. However, it has a limitation in terms of low power density. Battery life is reduced when exposed to high peak power demand brought on by frequent vehicle acceleration and deceleration. Therefore, the battery is integrated with a supercapacitor to fulfill the high-power requirement. A power management algorithm is needed to effectively utilize both the battery and supercapacitor. This work proposes a power management scheme based on a rule-based filtering technique. The algorithm uses the current division factor based on the instantaneous power loss minimization technique to reduce the system\'s energy loss. In addition, the algorithm uses a novel control approach, which includes a low-pass filtering approach to regulate the supercapacitor SoC. With the proposed algorithm, the improvement is seen in terms of battery power loss and energy loss compared to the existing rule-based algorithm. The algorithm\'s workings and the comparison study are validated through MATLAB/SIMULINK. The experimental studies validated the feasibility of the proposed scheme.','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/pvd-gcqs-ddb','','',1,'2024-04-12 04:54:30','Active'),(89,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','The Semiotics of Contemporary Indian Cricket','Surya Nandana','Ph.D. Research Scholar','Guide: Prof  S P Dhanavel','Humanities and Social Sciences','2024/04/16 15:00','2024-04-16','','Google meet','\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis study examines the significatory practices involved in Indian cricket â€“ in today\r\nâ€™s world of flamboyant performance, affective intensity, dynamic sociocultural identities and functions, corporeality, materiality, digitisation, commercialisation and commemoration â€“ through the lens of Barthesian semiotics.\r\n\r\nThe literature review traces the development of Indian cricket and its sociocultural implications. Cricket histories and journalistic texts by veteran scholars like Ramachandra Guha, Boria Majumdar and Mihir Bose are supported by writings on various dimensions of sport, such as spectacle, stardom and narrativity, by theoreticians like Francis W.

This study applies Barthesian semiotics to analyse cricket matches as texts of human activity (Miles et al., 2014).

Historically, the design of service disciplines focused on optimizing the average linear functions of sojourn times (rewards). Although the goal of optimizing linear rewards is well investigated, hardly any work considers optimizing nonlinear rewards, which have become crucial in many emerging delay-sensitive applications, including quantum communication, multimedia streaming, and online service platforms. \r\n\r\nIn our work, we focus primarily on identifying a single service discipline that maximizes the long-term average of nonlinear rewards. In particular, we view this problem for two arrival models - the first is a burst arrival model, wherein all jobs arrive at the server at the same instant. We show that the shortest job first (SJF) discipline maximizes the average reward for any monotonic function of the sojourn times. In the second setting, jobs arrive according to some stochastic process with i.i.d. service requirements. This setting is significantly more challenging to analyze, and identifying an optimal discipline remains elusive. We introduce a new service discipline, shortest predicted sojourn time (SPST), and provide analytical guarantees under specific settings. Numerically, we demonstrate that SPST outperforms well-known disciplines across multiple settings.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-12 09:39:59','Active'),(99,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\"Synthetic Lipids with Tunable Polarity Characteristics for Drug Delivery Applications\"','Ms. Akshaya K V (CY17D025)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Muraleedharan K M, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/17 15:00','2024-04-17','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','Drug delivery vehicles are generally formed from lipids, polymers or metal-organic frameworks, and are used to modulate the ADMET profiles of therapeutic entities. Apart from being bio-compatible, supramolecular or macromolecular matrices thus formed should not only favour high drug entrapment but also allow the release of constituents in a controlled manner. Because of rapid resistance induction on using monotherapy, use of drug combination has become inevitable in most of the disease areas. This has necessitated the development of carriers which can entrap more than one drug. This is challenging since the final concentration of individual constituents at the target site depends on multiple factors which include their stability under physiological conditions, differences in release rates etc. Previous research from our laboratory has shown the potential of oxanorbornane-based amphiphiles for drug delivery applications.1 The present work focusses on specific modifications on the head group for achieving multi-drug delivery. Considering the therapeutic relevance of low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (gasotransmitter), we have conjugated 1,2-dithiol-3-thione unit to the head group of such synthetic lipids and have used the conjugate as a vehicle for ibuprofen.2a Conjugation of 5FA (Anti-cancer agent) to the head group and use of the conjugates for co-delivery of Doxorubicin, and alteration of the polarity characteristics of the head group to modulate the uptake and toxicity profile of Doxorubicin are the other areas investigated.2b\r\nReferences:\r\n1. a) Gadde, S.

Experiments are conducted in the Weber number\r\nrange of 179 - 929; the corresponding Reynolds numbers are 5253 - 12091. The profile\r\nof the droplet interface is studied. Assuming self-similarity in the internal flow at the\r\ndroplet interface, the profiles are scaled using appropriate scales. It is observed that\r\nthe profiles of the droplet interface at different points of time collapse close to each\r\nother when plotted in this manner. This observation is experimental evidence of the\r\nself-similarity of the internal flow in this phase. Based on this fact, kinetic\r\nenergy is estimated at the early stages of droplet impact. The surface energy is also estimated by assuming axisymmetric droplet profile obtained through back-light imaging. We observe that a considerable amount of kinetic energy is lost during the early stages of droplet impact. We believe that an accurate estimation of this deficit in kinetic energy at an early stage of impact will be necessary to account for the energy-based models for droplet impact. Also due to initial kinetic energy, the droplet rapidly spreads outward upon impact until the viscous dissipation and the surface tension force slow the spreading. After a period, the droplet spreads slower while the film thinning rate becomes stagnant, resulting in a residual thickness. A measurement technique using a Chromatic Confocal Sensor is used here for the thickness measurement. This sensor allows to measure droplet thickness with high precision. Using the information on early phase energy dissipation and experimental data on spreading diameter and thickness, a model can be developed to capture the temporal evolution of droplet diameter during spreading.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/bdx-wojv-dqa','','',1,'2024-04-12 10:07:25','Active'),(101,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\"Metal-Free Synthesis of Stable Imidazolium and Pyrrolium Salts: Comprehensive Investigation of their Chemical, Photophysical, and Redox Properties\"','Mr. Prathap R (CY19D006)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Dr. Kartik Chandra Mondal, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/17 16:00','2024-04-17','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','The Ïƒ-donor stable singlet CAAC/NHC carbene has been reacted with in situ generated electron hungry aryne leading to the formation of initial carbene-aryne intermediate which further undergoes aryl group migration from N-atom of carbene to arynes leading to air-stable cyclic imine/imidazole product with C2 blocking in very good to excellent yields.

Electrochemical energy storage systems such as supercapacitor present promising solutions for meeting the rising energy demands due to their high-power density and cyclic stability.1,2 There is a continuous quest for discovering new materials that can outperform conventional electrode materials, driving significant demand for researchers to explore nanoparticles.3 In this work, copper tellurate (Cu3TeO6) has been synthesized and investigated as novel active nanomaterial for electrode fabrication for energy storage device. Among various tellurium-based compounds, Cu3TeO6 nanoparticles show promise for high-performance battery-type supercapacitor.4 Combining the high electrical conductivity and tunability of copper with structural stability of tellurium holds promise for enhancing energy storage performance.5 The colloquium will cover a brief introduction on the working principle of supercapacitor, nanomaterials and their properties relevant to diverse energy applications. In the first part, synthesis, physicochemical characterization and application of Cu3TeO6 nanoparticles for charge storage will be discussed.6 In the later part, morphological variations of Cu3TeO6 induced by surfactants during the synthesis, and their effect on the size, shape, and porous structure, and finally on their performance as supercapacitor electrodes will be presented. Surfactants functionalize the surface of nanoparticles, altering their surface chemistry and improving their compatibility with electrolyte solutions. This enhances the overall electrochemical performance of the electrode material in terms of storage and long cycling life. Further, Cu3TeO6 composite with carbon is synthesized to further enhance the storage performance and stability.

A computational framework based on the open-source CFD library OpenFOAM to study these instabilities in the context of afterburners is developed. \r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on the numerical investigation of flame dynamics and the thermo-acoustic oscillations of the bluff body combustor known as the Single Flameholder Agumentor (SFA) test rig at the Georgia Institute of Technology. These experiments used vitiated and high-velocity inlet conditions (Oxygen 15%, T=800â° C, and M=0.2-0.4) with spray-injected non-premixed mode of combustion. In these experiments, longitudinal thermo-acoustic instabilities in the range of 200-250 Hz were encountered, along with high-frequency wake flame oscillations above 1000 Hz. First comparison of modelling results with experimental data from the non-reacting conditions from the SFA is presented. Following this, results for the reacting cases with three global equivalence ratios of 0.5, 0.7, and 1 are considered. The results are analyzed to get insights into the mean temperature profiles, flame structure, pressure oscillations, fuel penetration effects, and the amplitude of the BVK oscillations. In this work, the hybrid LES model is used; this offers the advantage of not necessitating extremely fine grids by switching to RANS-based models in the near-wall regions. The Lagrangian approach is used to track droplets from the liquid spray injection into the computational domain. The simulations are carried out using the compressible Navier-Stokes solver â€œsprayFoamâ€ which also allows for the modeling of Lagrangian parcel injection. \r\nThe non-reacting results show large velocities up to 400 m/s near the flameholder trailing edge in addition to a von Karman-type vortex shedding at a Strouhal number of 0.25.  The reacting flow results show variation in the flame topology depending on the fuel injection rates.  The simulations show large amplitude pressure oscillations at 250 Hz for the highest equivalence ratio case, mirroring the experimental observations. By applying the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) technique, we confirm the excitation of the Â¾ th longitudinal of the combustor during the instability. Furthermore, the DMD of the fuel mass fraction field also confirmed the oscillations in the spray stream at the thermoacoustic frequency, indicating a thermoacoustic coupling. Also, high frequency (>1200 Hz) oscillations of the wake flame due to flame holder vortex shedding are correctly reproduced in the simulations. \r\n\r\nThus, this part of the work forms a basis for the development of a comprehensive computational framework for predicting and diagnosing thermoacoustic instabilities in the context of afterburners using OpenFOAM. Further studies can build upon these findings to optimize afterburner design and mitigate thermo-acoustic instabilities.','Varunkumar S','varuns@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-14 06:27:23','Active'),(105,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','OFFSHORE TOPSIDE WITH STEEL AND FGM STIFFENED COPED BEAM','Mr. Thennavan M,OE21D004, Ph.D Scholar','Mr. Thennavan M,OE21D004, Ph.D Scholar','Prof. Srinivasan chandrasekaran - Guide','Ocean Engineering Department','2024/04/15 14:00','2024-04-15','','Seminar Hall, Department of Ocean Engineering','Coped steel beams are the preferred option for enhancing the functionality and structural integrity of an offshore topside. Implementing coping strategies helps prevent the accumulation of multiple pipelines and cables in the workspace. The steel coped beam experiences local yielding and buckling due to the combined effects of waves, wind, impact, and accidental loads, which result in high-stress concentration. Functionally-graded materials (FGM) are viable substitutes for structural components in unique circumstances. This study addresses the development of a new material for strengthening coped beams using functionally grading Stellite-6 steel, which is a highly corrosion-resistant alloy, with carbon-manganese steel. The mechanical properties of the newly developed FGM are evaluated and compared to those of the alloying materials to demonstrate their superiority. FGM samples are produced using Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM), a cost-effective method known for its high deposition rates. Tensile test specimens conforming to ASTM E8 standards are extracted from the FGM build to evaluate its structural properties. The newly developed FGM demonstrates approximately 50% higher yield strength and 48% higher ultimate strength compared to X52 steel. The suitability of FGM for offshore applications is confirmed by its advantages in terms of carbon equivalency and weldability. The FGM-stiffened coped beams are suggested as alternative options because of their improved structural characteristics and durable character. The current study utilizes FGM (Functionally Graded Materials) to reinforce the coped beam by incorporating stiffeners. The mechanical properties of the constituent materials, Stellite-6 and Carbon Manganese steel, are improved by functionally grading them to better suit structural engineering applications. This study investigates the microstructure evaluation and mechanical properties of FGMs (Functionally Graded Materials), specifically Stellite-6 and Carbon Manganese steel, which were produced using wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). Variation in thermal gradient during layer deposition affects microstructure, improving the novel FGM\'s structural properties over its constituents. The alloy grain structure, precipitated phases, and improved mechanical properties are evaluated using SEM analysis. Experimental investigations validate a notable decrease in the rate of corrosion in the functionally graded material (FGM) as a result of the inclusion of Stellite-6. Additionally, it enhances the strength and durability, qualities that are greatly desired for coped beam stiffeners. \r\nCoped beams are often used in the fabrication of land structures; however, the existence of coped regions significantly restricts the maximum load-bearing capacity and may even lead to unfavorable failure modes. This study aims to examine the recently introduced coped beam concept in offshore construction, as well as the failure modes of coped steel and FGM Stiffened beams. The steel beams with coping and the FGM-strengthened coped beam was produced and subjected to experimental evaluation. Furthermore, a finite element model was created and verified using the experimental data. Subsequently, a parametric analysis was performed to measure the impact of different cope geometries. The steel and FGM Stiffened coped beams were analyzed and compared using the 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method. The results were compared to both numerical and experimental data, and a strong correlation was observed. The maximum load for specimen CB-600 exceeds the maximum load for specimens CB-500 and CB-300 by 22% and 50% respectively. The duration of the post-peak and instability stages in specimen CP-600 is greater than that of specimens CB-500 and CB-300. The results demonstrate that the cope has an impact on the loading carrying capacity and buckling of coped beams with varying cope geometries. The parametric analysis results indicated that the shape of the cope had a significant impact on the structural performance of the steel beams. The Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique facilitated the quantification of strain and deformation in the steel-coped beams, yielding a valuable understanding of their response to various loading conditions. The comparison between numerical and experimental results further confirmed the precision of the finite element model, emphasizing its utility in predicting the performance of coped steel and FGM beams in offshore construction. The overall study highlights the importance of using new FGM materials in offshore topside and heavy industries that require coped beams to accommodate service mains.\r\n','Ocean Engineering Department','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-15 03:41:46','Active'),(106,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\'\'PROFITABLE MARKET MECHANISM FOR PLATFORM, BASED AGGREGATOR TAXI SERVICES\'\'','Mr. SWAMINATHAN RAMMOHAN, MS16D009','Ph.D. SCHOLAR','Prof. RAHUL R .

While the pioneering works of M. K. Geraghty and W. J. Carroll provided a fundamental understanding of this field, a multitude of studies in the past two decades have aimed to improve the profitability of taxi services. We begin with an extensive examination of contemporary literature concerning RM practices specifically applied in the taxi industry. The literature review is centered around essential aspects such as pricing mechanisms, market structure, business models, technological innovations, and marketing strategies. Through a comprehensive analysis of relevant research articles, this study aims to unveil novel trends and progressive research avenues in the domain of the taxi industry RM. Additionally, the literature review aims to identify significant gaps in existing literature, thereby paving the way for future investigations and scholarly exploration.\r\nBased on the literature review, it was evident that the selection of sales channels plays a critical role in the context of platform-based taxi services (PATS). Notably, PATS recently incorporated a variant of opaque selling known as group rides, where passengers with nearby pick-up and drop-off locations and coinciding departure times are grouped together for a single ride. Typically, PATS employ a listed price strategy for both regular and opaque channels, which limits passengers and drivers to accept or decline rides without any scope for further negotiation or engagement. To address this limitation, we propose the introduction of an alternative channel called \'Name Your Own Price\' (NYOP). This novel channel introduces a certain level of opacity regarding ride features and additional waiting time, while efficiently capturing the preferences of both passengers and drivers. The introduction of NYOP presents a valuable opportunity to accommodate passengers with lower ride valuations, who were previously excluded due to higher fixed prices. By enabling passengers to suggest their own prices, the NYOP channel facilitates the provision of rides at reduced rates, making transportation more accessible and affordable for a wider range of passengers.\r\nIn our first analytical model, we demonstrate that the increased level of opacity and additional waiting times in sales channels provided by the NYOP leads to improved passenger segmentation, resulting in higher revenue for the platform. Moreover, the NYOP channel creates additional ride opportunities for drivers, enabling them to generate extra revenue and\r\nachieve the incentive threshold set by the platform. Furthermore, our research delves into the decision-making processes of drivers when faced with the option of an NYOP channel in the presence of target-based incentives, providing valuable insights into their bidding behaviour.\r\nSubsequently, our second analytical study delves into the examination of driver behavior through the lens of PATS in the presence of market competition. If a driver has the choice of selecting a taxi ride when there are two platforms available, it is worth investigating the driver\'s switching behavior, especially in the presence of incentives. In this study, we propose a framework for optimally designing the platform policies in a duopoly market in the presence of driver incentives for completing a threshold number of rides in a given time period. Our analysis has uncovered a pattern in the decision-making of platform 1, and our findings indicate that platform 1 maximizes its utility by prioritizing the ease of sending rides to a driver when she is commencing her day, thus aligning its interests with the driver\'s goal of accumulating rides. However, as the driver approaches the target-based threshold for incentives, platform 1 diminishes its motivation to provide additional ride opportunities to the driver.\r\nOur contributions in the field of operations management play a crucial role in enhancing taxi utilization rates. Further, we provide recommendations to platforms for increasing the taxi market efficiency, especially during non-peak hours. In addition, we focus on understanding customer behavior by segmenting passengers based on their valuation, opacity quotient, and waiting times. Further, we introduce alternative pricing strategies and devise revenue maximization techniques for PATS. These contributions are aimed at optimizing the overall performance and effectiveness of the taxi industry during periods of lower demand, ultimately benefiting passengers, taxi drivers, and platforms.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION.-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadr','','',1,'2024-04-15 04:43:57','Active'),(107,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Integrative biology approach to unravel the mechanism of immunogenic response and protein assembly in  Dengue and Zika viruses','Jaya Vasavi P (BT21D402)','Ph.D. scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Dr. Sanjib Senapati (BT)','Department of Biotechnology','2024/04/17 15:30','2024-04-17','','BT Seminar Hall','Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are most prevalent mosquito-borne pathogens belonging to the Flaviviridae family. Globally, about 400 million DENV infections and nearly 40,000 deaths are reported every year. In 2015 alone, ZIKV affected over 200,000 individuals, causing Microcephaly and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. Despite their severity in transmission, no approved drugs/vaccines are available, presumably due to the structural complexity and lack of molecular-level insights of the virus particles. During viral infection, innate immune cells present degraded viral proteins via MHC proteins. T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognize these antigens presented by MHC, initiating a T-cell immune response. However, the underlying mechanism of triggered immune response during MHC-antigen-TCR interaction is unknown. Using coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we explore conformational changes in TCR that lead to T-cell immunogenicity and introduce Machine Learning strategies to extract important features. This can aid in the in-silico identification of viable viral antigens priming vaccine design. Another approach to inhibit viral infection is to rupture the virion assembly. Here, we investigate the self-assembly process of viral E proteins through accelerated MD simulations. Elucidating the atomic details of E protein dimerization could pave ways to examine various pockets for drug binding and, thus, to design drugs to inhibit DENV and ZIKV.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-15 04:56:23','Active'),(108,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Modeling failure of solids in fluid-structure interaction problems','Mr. S P Krishna Phanindra,  ED19D750','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Engineering Design','Dr. Shankar Ram C S (Chair)\r\n\r\nDr. Srikanth Vedantam  (Guide)\r\n\r\nDr.  Sandipan Bandyopadhyay,\r\n\r\nDr. R Jayaganthan\r\n\r\nDr. Sarith P Sathian, AM','Engineering Design Department','2024/04/15 16:30','2024-04-15','','Google Meet joining info Video call link: https://meet.google.com/jss-stdc-oxh','Modeling fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems is of great importance in diverse engineering areas. Traditional grid-based frameworks are used to study such problems but have been found to suffer from various difficulties, especially in problems involving large deformations of the solid and structural failure. Particle-based approaches for modeling the fluid as well as the solid are gaining prominence due to their advantages in these settings. However, most of these approaches limit themselves to linear elastic solids. In this study, we present a novel particle-based fluid-structure interaction framework based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model for fluids and a recently developed constitutively informed particle dynamics (CPD) model for solids. We present the detailed methodology for coupling these approaches to solve FSI problems. The advantage of this framework is its ability to model failure and a wide range of solid constitutive behavior, which hasn\'t been studied earlier in the literature. Using the proposed model, we study the failure of notched hyperelastic obstacles impacted by fluid flow.','EDOffice','edoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-15 05:55:03','Active'),(109,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','â€œANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF OPERATING CONDITIONS ON LITHIUM-ION BATTERY DEGRADATIONâ€','MR.

The technology has established itself as a reliable energy storage mechanism over the past decade. Nevertheless, it continues to face challenges, including safety concerns, prolonged charging duration, and a decline in capacity over time. One of the major safety concerns is the lithium plating phenomenon encountered in lithium-ion batteries. Lithium plating is the reduction of lithium ions on the surface of the negative electrode while charging a lithium-ion battery. Lithium plating reaction can eventually lead to dendrite formation and shorting of the battery. The lithium plating phenomenon has been attributed to two major factors, viz. increased charging voltage and charging at low temperatures. Charging a battery under these conditions increases the concentration of lithium ions at the anode compared to what can be intercalated into the electrode. This leads to a drop in electrochemical potential, and the ions get reduced on the surface of the electrode.\r\n\r\nTo understand the degradation of lithium-ion batteries at different temperatures, a first-principles-based electro-thermal battery model was developed. The model incorporates two different parasitic side reactions: the lithium plating reaction and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formation reaction. These two reactions consume the lithium ions in the battery, leading to its degradation. The first principles-based model can detect changes in desired and undesired reactions at different temperatures. The model can also quantify the amount of lithium lost to the parasitic side reactions. Understanding these side reactions in the battery will help develop methodologies to mitigate its degradation while improving its safety.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','The Ph.D. RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM SEMINAR in respect of Mr. ARUN MUTHUKKUMARAN (CH19D751) will be held o','seminar15-04-2024 06:09','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar15-04-2024 06:09',1,'2024-04-15 06:09:27','Active'),(110,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\"Spectroscopic and Kinetic investigations of Aromatic, Aliphatic Volatile Organic Compounds, and Halogen Monoxide Using State-of-the-Art Experimental Techniques and Theoretical Methods\"','Mr. Prasanna Kumar Bej (CY18D098)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Rajakumar B, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/18 16:00','2024-04-18','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','The atmospheric oxidants, such as OH, Cl, NOx, or ozone, react with the relevant atmospheric substrate or transient species, forming radicals and stable products, which could potentially impact the environment by creating soot particles or aerosols. The pollutants reportedly have an impact on the human respiratory system as well as on the biotic world1.\r\nAromatic hydrocarbons like benzene, toluene, and xylene are oxidized to form resonance-stabilized radicals in the atmosphere. Among all the isomers of xylene, o-xylene is one of the most widely used isomers, which finds its usage in paints, adhesives, coating, etc. When o-xylene gets emitted into the atmosphere, it reacts with atmospheric oxidants and forms the resonance stabilized o-xylyl radical. The study involving the measurement of the absolute absorption cross-section of o-xylyl radical in the wavelength range of 460.1â€“475.1 nm using CRDS will be discussed1. The five-membered hetero-aromatic compounds like pyrrole, furan, and thiophene play a critical role in cloud formation, influencing cloud properties like albedo, lifetime and consequently affect the Earth\'s radiative balance. The experimental and theoretical temperature-dependent reaction kinetics of Cl-atom and OH-radical with methyl thiophene will be discussed as one part of the study.\r\nThe reduction of the ozone layer in the stratosphere is effectively facilitated by the emission of halogen compounds (X=F, Cl, Br, and I) from anthropogenic and artificial resources, mostly in coastal areas (2,3). The oxide substituent of these compounds, especially monoxides (XO), has a significant role in ozone depletion. Peroxy radicals, RO2 (R=H, CH3, C2H5, C3H7, etc.) are the primary consumers of halogen monoxides in the atmosphere. Therefore, one of the studies will encompass a discussion on the experimental and theoretical determination of reaction rates between propyl peroxy and iso-propyl peroxy with BrO radical, facilitated by CRDS methodology. Furthermore, a theoretical kinetic study of isoprene (known as Bio VOCs) with XO (Cl, Br, I) will be discussed to analyze the oxidation impact of isoprene.\r\nReferences:\r\n1)	Bej, P.
