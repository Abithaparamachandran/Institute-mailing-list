The quantum\r\nextremal island method investigates the information paradox within lower-dimensional\r\nGaussâ€“Bonnet gravity, specifically focusing on a three-dimensional EGB black hole.\r\nAlso, we employ the island prescription to explore the information paradox within\r\nnon-AdS spacetime, specifically in the context of warped Anti-de Sitter black holes. We\r\nare examining eternal black holes which do not undergo evaporation. These black holes\r\nare connected to an external reservoir, facilitating the radiation reaching the boundary.\r\nThrough this process black holes can completely evaporate and disappear. The results\r\nindicate that initially, the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation exhibits a linear\r\ngrowth with time, eventually becoming unbounded later. However, when accounting for\r\nthe emergence of an island later and just beyond the event horizon, the growth in the\r\nentanglement entropy of Hawking radiation stabilizes at a constant value. This constant\r\nvalue is precisely twice the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We also examine the Page time\r\nand the Scrambling time and their dependence on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second part, we examine a quantum field propagating within a spacetime generated\r\nby a specific Z2 quotient of the BTZ black hole. We investigate how the presence of the\r\nmatter field influences the spacetime geometry, considering linear perturbations in the\r\nmetric. The exact computation of the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor is\r\nachievable by evaluating its pull-back onto the covering space. By selecting appropriate\r\nboundary conditions for the quantum field along a non-contractible cycle of the quotient\r\nmanifold, it becomes feasible to achieve a negative average energy along a null geodesic,\r\nforming a traversable wormhole.\r\n','HoD Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-03 06:19:05','Active'),(3,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\"Carbone [(L)2C(0)] Based Complexes Towards Dinitrogen Activation and Catalysisâ€','Ms. Madhuri Bhattacharya (CY21D094)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide- Dr. Kartik Chandra Mondal, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/08 15:00','2024-04-08','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','Nitrogen fixation by the reduction of N2 to NH3 is a requisite transformation for life. This can be done on a vast scale by the industrial Haberâ€“Bosch (HB) process using Mittasch catalyst at very high temperature (300ËšC) and pressure (100 bar), but in nature by nitrogenase enzymes present in certain micro-organisms under ambient conditions. Researchers have attempted to mimic nitrogenase, but due to the complex mechanism of N2 activation and inertness of N2, have met with limited success[1]. \r\nFor N2 activation, metalâ€“N Ï€-backbonding plays a crucial role. Higher the electron density on the metal, higher will be the backbonding. In this regard, carbone [(L)2C(0)] having two lone pairs of electrons, is a strong Ïƒ- and Ï€-donor ligand enhancing the electron density on the metal. Now carbodiphosphorane (CDP) is a particular type of carbone where L = phosphine. Although there are several works on expensive late transition metal and coinage metal carbone complexes[2]; early transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni) complexes, which are comparably cheaper, remain challenging to synthesis due to instability. Here I will be proposing different CDP ligands based 3d-transition metal complexes which can be implemented for N2 binding as expected from the theoretical calculations done by our group. Such strong electron donor ligands can stabilise coordinatively unsaturated metal centers, promoting catalysis[3]. In this seminar, an extensive presentation of carbodiphosphorane chemistry and itâ€™s metal complexes synthesized to date will be discussed, followed by my work done and the future perspective.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

For example, developing a new drug costs an average of 2.6 billion U.S. dollars and takes approximately a decade. Traditional computer-aided drug design methods are still ineffective due to the enormous size of the chemical space of drugs (estimated to be in the order of $10^{60}$) to be explored. Moreover, successfully designing a molecule for a particular context is just one piece of the puzzle. Once a potential lead molecule with optimized properties is generated, to realize its full therapeutic potential, a robust, economical, and sustainable pathway for synthesizing the molecule must be designed for practical application. Recent successes of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in different domains encourage us to investigate domain-specific generative and multimodal AI\'s role in solving the ``De-Novo Drug Discovery\" and ``Novel Reaction Pathway Discovery\" problems. In this presentation, we discuss our approach to addressing the prediction of drug properties, molecule generation, and synthesis pathway design, leveraging the power of AI in conjunction with domain knowledge. By harnessing various biochemical modalities such as sequences, 3D structures, and pathway networks, our method allows us to improve the pace of drug discovery and facilitates the sustainable production of a broader spectrum of compounds. We will highlight results from our work on developing chemistry-inspired interpretable representations for molecular property prediction and a de-novo molecule generation framework using Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we explore the integration of multiple biological modalities and capitalize on their synergies for synthesis pathway generation.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-04 03:44:01','Active'),(11,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Design, optimization, and experimental verification of superficial hyperthermia treatment of cancer using near-field microstrip patch antennas and ultrasound tissue thermometry.','Mr. Muthu Rattina Subash, ED19D700','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Engineering Design.','Dr.   Nilesh J Vasa (Chair)\r\n\r\nDr. Kavitha Arunachalam  (Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Arun K Thittai, AM (Co-Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Tuhin Subhra Santra,\r\n\r\nDr. M Ramasubba Reddy, AM','Department of Engineering Design','2024/04/04 15:00','2024-04-04','','ED107 ( Cybernetic Center)',' Hyperthermia is an adjuvant cancer treatment that elevates tumor temperature to 40-\r\n45 â„ƒ for 60-minute duration.

UCA consists of microbubbles of varying sizes, ranging from 1 Âµm to 10 Âµm in diameter. Although this method is expected to have great potential for clinical use, the variability observed in the acoustic amplitude with respect to the portal pressure is a challenge. Therefore, a clear understanding of the mechanics of microbubble response under acoustic excitation is required to explain this variability and optimize this methodology. However, there is a lack of systematic exploration into the mechanics and factors that affect microbubble response to acoustic excitation in the literature. This paper presents a novel finite element analysis-based framework for estimating portal pressure, which bridges this gap. The numerical model is developed in two stages: first, the subharmonic response of a single bubble subject to an acoustic excitation of 50 kPa at 4 MHz frequency is captured.

UCA consists of microbubbles of varying sizes, ranging from 1 Âµm to 10 Âµm in diameter. Although this method is expected to have great potential for clinical use, the variability observed in the acoustic amplitude with respect to the portal pressure is a challenge. Therefore, a clear understanding of the mechanics of microbubble response under acoustic excitation is required to explain this variability and optimize this methodology. However, there is a lack of systematic exploration into the mechanics and factors that affect microbubble response to acoustic excitation in the literature. This paper presents a novel finite element analysis-based framework for estimating portal pressure, which bridges this gap. The numerical model is developed in two stages: first, the subharmonic response of a single bubble subject to an acoustic excitation of 50 kPa at 4 MHz frequency is captured. The effect of bubble size on acoustic response is explored at this stage. In the second stage, the single bubble response is systematically applied to determine the effect of microbubble population, size distribution, and spatial distribution on the estimation of portal pressure. The developed framework is able to clarify the experimental variability, providing future direction for UCA in the field of pressure measurements.','EDOffice','edoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-04 07:18:36','Active'),(32,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\"Applications of 1,8 â€“ Diazabicyclo [5.4.0] undecâ€“7â€“ene based Ionic Liquids as Efficient Solvent Media for Selected Biopolymers\"','Ms. Jisha K J(CY17D048)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide- Prof. Ramesh Gardas, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/10 15:30','2024-04-10','yes','Online-Google meet','','CY Office','cyoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','ALL ARE WELCOME-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/nrs-souw-gav','','',1,'2024-04-04 09:04:30','Active'),(33,'','Closed Holiday',NULL,'test',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'test','test','test','test','','',1,'2024-04-04 09:07:55','default_value'),(34,'','Sports',NULL,'test',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'test','test','test@iitm.ac.in','','','',1,'2024-04-04 09:32:51','default_value'),(36,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Valorization of Bauxite Residue: Energy and other applications.','Mr. M.

These low-dimensional materials exhibit a strong Coulomb interaction owing to reduced dielectric screening, resulting in stable excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) at room temperature [1,2]. In this work, we have studied the 2D oxide material Î±-MoO3 and its heterostructure with other TMDC materials. Our primary objective is to investigate many-body complexes, such as excitons and trions, for excitonic-based device applications. The Î±-MoO3 is a unique 2D oxide semiconductor that has recently gained immense potential in the field of optoelectronics because of its high workfunction (~6.0â€‰eV) and band gap (~3.0 eV) [3]. A large workfunction enables spontaneous electron transfer from most 2D materials to Î±-MoO3 in a heterostructure design, making Î±-MoO3 a viable candidate for designing self-driven photodetectors and hole transport layers in solar cells [3]. Our initial study was devoted to examining the charge transfer in the Î±-MoO3/MoS2 heterostructure and the subsequent formation of positive trions composed of one electron and two holes at low temperatures [4]. These trions are electrically controllable and contain information about energy, charge, and spin  [1]. In the next part of the work, we utilized H+-ion irradiation to tune the photoluminescence (PL) emission of Î±-MoO3 in a visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum  [5]. In addition, we have observed that the as-grown Î±-MoO3 crystals exhibit strong in-plane Raman anisotropy due to their low symmetric crystal structure. Furthermore, in-plane Raman anisotropy has been characterized by angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy, and the degree of anisotropy in Î±-MoO3 is quantified, which will be helpful for designing polarization-sensitive photonic devices. In the Final part of the work, we demonstrated the selective tuning of memristive characteristics of Î±-MoO3 through synthesizing two distinct single crystal types (referred to as type-I&II) using the physical vapor deposition technique.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1]	T.

Local scour around piers is a major cause of bridge failures. This research aimed to study the effect of (i) pier shape, (ii) footing geometry on local scour depth, and (iii) the flow field, turbulence, and scouring around different-shaped piers. The effect of pier shape on the scour depth is investigated using circular (M1) (diameter, D = 5 cm) and two modified pier shapes (M2 and M3), where M2 is a combination of semi-circle and triangle oriented either way (M2a and M2b), and M3 is a further modification to M2a with a small protrusion on the semi-circular end. The results showed that the scour depth for M2a, M2b, and M3 piers is reduced by 23.5%, 50%, and 55% compared to the M1. However, the scour depth increases if a skew angle is imposed. Also, tests with the piers in tandem showed that M1 as front pier and M2a as rear pier spaced at 1.0D, and M1 as rear pier and M3 as front pier spaced at 1.75D produced the least scour depths. The sensitivity analysis shows skew angle and flow velocity are the most influential parameters.\r\nBridge foundations can be exposed to flow due to long-term riverbed degradation, which affects the scour around compound piers. Experiments are conducted using a compound pier with pier diameter D and footing diameter (Df = 2D) located at different elevations. The footing at or just below the riverbed reduced the scour depths up to 57% than the pier alone, while those projecting into the flow aided scouring. Footing diameter and flow depth are the key parameters influencing scour depth prediction. Further, flow field, turbulence, and scouring around different-shaped piers are studied through 3-D velocity measurements, revealing the shielding effect of footing from the impact of downflow and horseshoe vortices in reducing scour depth around compound piers. The distribution of velocities, Reynolds shear stresses, turbulent kinetic energy, vorticity, and bed shear stresses around each pier model are studied. The developed M5 models for estimating scour depth around different-shaped piers are accurate (R2 > 0.85) than existing scour equations. This research proposes efficient pier shapes for scour reduction and contributes to safe bridge designs.','G Mathangi','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-04 12:21:03','Active'),(47,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Dynamics and control of an underwater glider','Mr.Kumar Vaibhav, Roll No: OE21S002','Mr.Kumar Vaibhav, Roll No: OE21S002, MS Scholar.','Guide: Dr. Suresh Rajendran, Department of Ocean Engineering.','OCEAN ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT','2024/04/05 16:00','2024-04-05','','Seminar Hall, Department of Ocean Engineering','The research is divided into two main sections.

To achieve path following of an underwater glider (taken as a point mass model), a virtual target method is used. The primary objective of path following is to obtain control inputs that allow the glider to converge to the desired path with high accuracy and minimum control input. To achieve this, the path following problem is first converted into an optimal control problem, and a pseudo-spectral (PS) framework is employed to solve it.

Despite significant advancements in catalyst materials and electrolyzer optimization, translating this progress into practical applications is challenging due to the system\'s complex multiphase and multiscale nature, particularly under industrially relevant conditions. To develop more accurate models, accounting for uncertainties in the physical system is crucial, ranging from estimating kinetic parameters to biases in transport parameters. In this study, we perform uncertainty quantification of an electrochemical cell model validated against experimental data. We explore the uncertainties associated with the input model parameters and compare them with the experimental measurements, assessing the reliability of the model predictions. Our analysis also sheds light on the contribution of different parameters to the variation in current density predictions, which can help build confidence in the model. By quantifying the biases and uncertainties in model parameters, we can develop more accurate models, which could accelerate the translation of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into practical applications.\r\n\r\n','K P GEETHA','choffice','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/nmq-khdy-avs','','',1,'2024-04-05 05:04:24','Active'),(49,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Optimization of utility-based shortfall risk: A non-asymptotic viewpoint','Mr. Sumedh Sunil Gupte, Roll No: CS21D014','Ph.D. Research Scholar','Dr. Sutanu Chakraborti - DC Chair,\r\nDr. Prashanth L A - Guide,\r\nDr. Sanjay P Bhat - Co-Guide - EE,\r\nDC Members:\r\nDr. Mitesh Khapra - CSE,\r\nDr. Harish Guruprasad - CSE,\r\nDr. Abhishek Sinha - EE.','Computer Science and Engineering','2024/04/10 11:00','2024-04-10','','A M Turing Hall (SSB 334, Second Floor)','We consider the problems of estimation and optimization of utility-based shortfall risk (UBSR), which is a popular risk measure in finance.

Hydrogen is one of such alternatives; however, it will be environmentally and economically sustainable only when it is generated by using a renewable source such as solar energy. The photoelectrochemocal approach of generating hydrogen from splitting of water is an attractive option provided the photoative materials yield optimum efficiency of light absorption, photocarrier generation and reaction kinectics. In practice, no single material can achieve the desired qualities and hence the heterojunction approach has been investigated. In the proposed work, heterojunction between two metal oxide components will be fabricated in such a way that the resulting material configuration not only achieves a desired alignment of the energy bands (to help charge seperation) but also yield a high specific surface area for enhanced catalytic activity. Metal oxide nanostructures will first be fabricated using chemical techniques followed by the deposition of an overlayer with Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) technique. The basic characterization for crystallinity, microstructure, morphology, composition and optical and electronic properties will be discussed. Finally, specific investigation proposals for the heterojunction and water splitting experiments will be presented.

This is \r\nachieved through strategic utilization of transformation-induced plasticity associated with \r\nretained austenite. Hence, ensuring precise tailoring of retained austenite content, morphology \r\nand size is crucial for Q&P steels. The current research work introduces a novel processing \r\ntechnique involving a combination of hot rolling and a direct quench and partitioning \r\ntreatments to produce an ultra-high strength, low-carbon and lean-composition steel with \r\nsuperior mechanical properties and enhanced stretch flangeability. The methodology involves \r\nthe introduction of a secondary partitioning step after a one-step direct quenching and \r\npartitioning (DQP) process. A detailed investigations on microstructures, tensile properties and \r\nstretch flangeability (using hole expansion testing) were carried out. The martensite-austenite \r\ntwo phase microstructure resulted in a remarkably improved product of strength and elongation \r\n(PSE, 24 GPa.%), the hole expansion ratio of 45% and a total elongation of 21.7%. It is shown \r\nthat the stability of retained austenite, rather than its volume fraction, has a significant impact \r\non the strain hardening rate, and therefore influences strength, ductility and stretch \r\nflangeability.

The figure of the child has been used extensively in cinema, turning it into a valuable â€“ in fact, potentially overwhelming resource for reflecting on the cultural histories of childhood. Within the American cultural imaginary, particularly mainstream Hollywood, the distinction given to childhood has become ubiquitous, creating â€˜hyperrealâ€™ idealizations of innocence, vulnerability, and dependency, with children often perceived as embryonic adults.\r\n\r\nDrawing on the theories of Baudrillard, Bourdieu, Jameson and Butler, the attempt is to deconstruct the representational strategies underpinning the depiction of the child image in select filmic texts. While doing so, it seeks to situate the child within the familial context, viewed as an emblematic microcosm reflective of broader American societal dynamics, thus unpacking the regulatory power structures and ideological interplay inherent within the familial domain. Furthermore, this research aims to discern the multifaceted modalities through which Independent cinema engages with and reimagines the child subject within the evolving cultural landscape of America. By scrutinizing the cinematic construction of childhood and the family unit, this research illuminates the complexities of representing childhood agency, autonomy, and subjectivity amidst shifting cultural paradigms, offering insights into the socio-political implications of these cinematic narratives.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKeywords: Child figure, American Independent Cinema, Agency, American Dream, American Family, Postmodernism.','HSS OFFICE','hsoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link[Google meet.google.com/qji-wbaj-efq]','','',1,'2024-04-05 09:44:23','Active'),(53,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\"Metal-organic framework and coordination polymer-based materials for supercapacitor applicationsâ€','Mr. Tapan Kumar Ghosh(CY17D015)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Ranga Rao G, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/10 16:30','2024-04-10','yes','Online-Google Meet','','CY Office','cyoffice@smail.iitm.ac.in','ALL ARE WELCOME-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/ggt-fton-qps','','',1,'2024-04-05 09:47:37','Active'),(54,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','â€˜â€™INTEGRATED ROUTING AND INVENTORY OPTIMIZATION FOR A 2-STAGE DIVERGENT SUPPLY CHAIN WITH PERISHABLE ITEMSâ€™â€™.','Mr. DEVANSH RAI, Roll no.

This study focuses on a divergent 2-stage supply chain encompassing a distributor and multiple retailers. Unfulfilled demands at the retailer are considered lost sales, while unmet demand is considered backordering at the distributor. The objective is to identify the optimal continuous review inventory ordering policy for a multi-period problem integrated with routing strategies, aiming to maximize the Total Supply Chain Profit (TSCP) over a finite planning horizon. This research incorporates real-world complexities in perishable products inventory management, such as demand uncertainty, price-dependent demand, markdown prices, and inventory rationing. A hybrid continuous review (s, S, $\\beta$, Q) inventory policy, commonly used in blood inventory management, is proposed for other perishable products such as fruits, vegetables, and dairy products and benchmarked against established continuous review policies, including (s, Q), (s, S), and (s, S, q, Q), all integrated with inventory routing. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid policy surpasses classical and hybrid continuous review policies regarding total supply chain profit when combined with routing and other complexities. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis explores variations in results with changing model parameters, such as time horizon, product shelf-life, demand distributions, and lead-time settings.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','MS SEMINAR-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-05 13:42:32','Active'),(55,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','When surfaces matter: how nano-scaled surface features effect macro-scale transport','Prof. Gary Rosengarten, Mechanical Engineering at RMIT, Australia','Professor Gary Rosengarten is Director of the Sustainable Technologies and Systems Enabling Impact Platform at RMIT University, and leader of the Laboratory for Innovative Fluid Thermal Systems in Mechanical Engineering.\r\n\r\nBefore deciding on an academic career, he spent 3 years at Australiaâ€™s National research laboratory, CSIRO, and 2 years as an Engineering consultant in sustainable building design.\r\n\r\nHe completed a double honours degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering at Monash University and a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the University of New South Wales.\r\n\r\nHe applies his research expertise in thermofluids and energy systems, to help solve a wide variety of problems, particularly in energy storage, solar energy, thermal control, energy efficiency, and biosystems, working closely with interdisciplinary teams from academia and industry.\r\n\r\nHe has developed solar absorbers using radiative selective surfaces and is one of the pioneers of solar spectral splitting using vo','Host Faculty: Prof. Arvind Pattamatta, ME, IITM','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/04/08 15:00','2024-04-08','yes','Hybrid Mode: MSB 211 & through Google Meet link:- https://meet.google.com/vkv-qoct-mzw','Typical heat transfer correlations or surface property data assume that surfaces are smooth or that they donâ€™t affect transport properties such as convection or radiation. \r\nHowever micro to nano-scaled features can have a massive effect on many  macroscale continuum transport properties.\r\nIn this presentation I will showcase some of our work on a simple and cheap chemical method to create superhydrophilic copper surfaces that we apply to copper foams to significantly enhance capillarity- primary for heat pipe wicks,   surface metamaterials for selective solar thermal absorbers and superhydrophobic surfaces for enhanced spray cooling heat transfer rates.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/vkv-qoct-mzw','','',1,'2024-04-08 01:33:27','Active'),(56,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Evaluating Critical Influencing Factors for Indiaâ€™s Transition to a Gas based Economy Using Multi-Agent Supply Chain Models','MR.

The \r\nAsia-Pacific region accounts for almost 65% of the global LNG demand. There was a 4.5% \r\ngrowth in global LNG consumption in 2022 compared to 2021. A substantial increase in NG \r\nconsumption is forecasted in China and India at 7% and 4%, respectively, compared to the \r\n2022-2023 levels. Further, to ensure energy security3, it is imperative to plan investments and \r\nestablish a gas supply chain (SC) infrastructure based on the forecasted end-use uptake. Thus, \r\nhere we seek to develop a systematic framework for planning gas SC infrastructure to \r\nenable large developing countries like India to plan optimal national-level supply chain \r\nnetworks for natural gas. \r\nExisting energy transition literature emphasizes the role of government policy and \r\ntechnological innovation, while little has been written to integrate â€œtop-downâ€ approaches \r\nencompassing government policy and â€œbottom-upâ€ individual enterprise-level decisions. \r\nTherefore, here we develop a hybrid top-down, bottom-up production-consumption model \r\ntowards intra-national energy transition planning using a decentralized agent-based approach, \r\nincluding a detailed geographic coverage utilizing GIS to map individual energy units. This \r\nenables the SC-level dynamics of end-users to be considered when pursuing economic \r\nobjectives subject to regulatory constraints.  \r\nThe NG supply chain comprises natural gas production sites, floating storage and \r\nregasification units (FSRUs), and LNG import and regasification terminals as the suppliers, \r\npipeline grids supplemented by virtual pipelines based on road or rail transport as \r\ninfrastructure, and end-users who use gas as fuel or feedstock as the consumers. In large \r\ncountries such as India, estimating the demand for NG would necessitate estimating the landed \r\nprice of gas for each end-user. A key component of the landed price is the supply chain cost, \r\nwith significant spatio-temporal dependence. Gas pipelines are the cheapest means to transport \r\nNG over long distances but are economically viable only for large quantities. Road and rail\r\nbased virtual pipelines have higher unit shipping costs. However, they are economically \r\nattractive for smaller demands and shorter distances. This intricate interplay between \r\n1 \r\ndemand and economics of NG makes planning the supply chain at the national level a \r\nchallenging yet critical problem for developing national policies and studying related \r\neconomics.  \r\nThe proposed methodology comprises two distinct models â€“ an agent-based \r\nProduction Consumption Model (PCM) to assess the spatially distributed demand for NG \r\nand an Infrastructure Planning Model (IPM) to estimate the logistics costs of transporting \r\ngas from the various supply nodes to the demand centers. NG suppliers (LNG regasification \r\nterminals and NG production facilities) and end-users are distributed spatially and, along with \r\nlogistic providers, are modeled as rational, self-interested decision-making entities in PCM. \r\nEach end-user agent may desire to switch to an alternate fuel at a future time, subject to \r\navailability, affordability, and national environmental regulations. Capital expenditure on \r\nbuilding pipelines is estimated through the IPM, considering factors like geographic location \r\n(e.g., presence of terrains and water bodies).  \r\nIn this work, we present the application of the integrated simulation-optimization model \r\nin estimating demand for NG from 2022 to 2042 across Pan India, along with planning the \r\nnecessary infrastructure to meet the demand. The model comprises over ~2100 spatially \r\ndistributed end-users, including large power plants, refineries, fertilizer units, petrochemicals, \r\nas well as city gas distributors across various urban centers. The spatiotemporal demand and \r\nSC infrastructure evolution of NG arising from these end-users\' decisions over the 20-year \r\nhorizon are estimated by the model for different market and policy scenarios. Our results \r\nfeaturing natural gas usage across India suggest the power and city gas sectors to be the \r\nconsistent demand drivers, with their share rising from ~40% of the total in 2022 to ~60% by \r\n2032. This is consistent with IEA and IRENA projections.  The proposed agent-based model \r\nthus provides multiple benefits: It enables the identification of key sectors driving the \r\nenergy transition; it helps analyze critical factors like resource availability, supply chain \r\ninfrastructure, and economics; and it can be used to develop decision support tools to \r\ninvestigate clean energy policies. \r\nKeywords: production-consumption model; supply chain dynamics; technology switch; clean \r\nand low carbon fuel; strategic decisions ','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/sco-xuwj-tcp','seminar08-04-2024 03:32','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar08-04-2024 03:32',1,'2024-04-08 03:32:46','Active'),(57,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','â€œSCREENING OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLASTIC WASTES TO EVALUATE RESOURCE RECOVERY POTENTIAL THROUGH ANALYTICAL PYROLYSIS','MR.

Among various anthropogenic waste materials, plastic waste has been a promising source of energy and feedstock recovery, and their conversion into valuable fuels and platform chemicals can promote sustainable management and utilization of plastic solid wastes and circular economy. Ocean debris comprises 80% of plastic waste which also can be used as a source of energy and feedstock recovery. The present study aims at collection of beach plastic wastes from the sea shore in Chennai, India, and characterizations are done to determine their composition and polymer types. The quantification of pyrolysis vapours (pyrolysates) was carried out to determine the resource and monomer recovery potential in perspectives to petrochemical industries. Moreover, the study is also focused on in-depth characterization of post-consumer multi-layered plastic packaging waste (MLPW) by various methods such as thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, bomb calorimetry, proximate and ultimate analyses. Further, based on the chemical composition of the MLPW, its non-catalytic pyrolysis and zeolite-catalysed pyrolysis was studied. The activity of various conventional zeolites is evaluated and the salient process conditions like pyrolysis temperature and feed-to-catalyst ratio are optimized for the maximum yield of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) in the pyrolysates.

In this seminar, we explore leveraging the spatial cues in sound and vision to solve two problems:  generating immersive binaural audio for videos and 360Â° depth estimation.\r\n\r\n     In the first part of the seminar, we explore the problem of generating binaural audio (two-channel) for videos, even if they only have regular monaural (single-channel) audio. These binaural videos provide a more immersive video experience for users. Such videos are more immersive, enhancing user experience. Here, we tackle a more difficult version of this problem by synthesizing binaural audio for a video with monaural audio in a weakly semi-supervised setting (in the absence of a lot of annotated data).  Our approach relies on using any downstream task that requires binaural audio as a proxy for supervision, reducing the need for explicit supervision. In this work, we use Sound Source Localization with only audio as a proxy task for weak supervision. Using this proxy task as supervision, we leverage the visual cues to understand where sounds are coming from in the scene and infuse them into audio to create a realistic 3D audio effect. \r\n\r\n    In the second part of the seminar, we explore how sound, along with RGB images, can be leveraged to improve the depth map of the scene. We experiment with echoes, which are sound reflections from the environment. Given that the echoes encode room geometry, it is possible to reconstruct the 3D room geometry, thereby depth, from echoes. We investigate how echoes, along with limited camera views, can be used to create a complete 3D depth map of a surrounding environment. This technique enables us to estimate 360Â° depth perception with limited camera views and gives spatial awareness even if we can\'t see everything around us. Our experiments demonstrate that echoes can significantly improve depth estimation accuracy, particularly for 360Â° cameras. Furthermore, the use of audio-visual information together provides a complementary approach to estimating 360Â° depth maps with limited information.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/eia-gxsb-tiu','','',1,'2024-04-08 08:21:55','Active'),(62,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Metal-organic framework and coordination polymer-based materials for supercapacitor applications','Mr. Tapan Kumar Ghosh(CY17D015)','Ph.

This study presents a novel multistep methodology for stochastic simulation of streamflow time series, leveraging the PcStream clustering algorithm to dynamically manage temporal data clusters and adapt to concept drifts in the streamflow data. The proposed approach involves fitting kappa and GEV distributions to model daily variations and extreme values, followed by PcStream clustering to categorize streamflow data based on the probability distribution of flows. A Markov chain model is then employed to regenerate cluster series, and the nearest neighbour approach is used to fill the cluster series with historical data. The flow series is classified into rising, falling, or constant phases, and these phases are simulated to generate synthetic streamflow series that closely mirror observed dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by comparing observed and simulated flow statistics across various streamflow gage stations. Results show that the model successfully reproduces seasonal patterns, low flows, high flow extremes, autocorrelations, and flow duration curves. The approach captures the nuances of streamflow pulses by explicitly modeling rising, falling, and constant flow phases based on state classifications. The flexibility of PcStream to fine-tune its parameters allows for tailored clustering that accommodates the specific characteristics of streamflow data. This study introduces a sophisticated tool for understanding and predicting the complex dynamics of hydrological systems, integrating statistical modeling, unsupervised machine learning, and temporal sequence analysis to simulate complete streamflow series. The proposed multistep methodology offers a new approach for generating synthetic yet realistic streamflow scenarios, thereby enhancing water resource planning and management in an ever-changing environment.','R.

The framework of differential privacy renders analysis on the congregated data while ensuring that any individual\'s contribution to the dataset remains indistinguishable. Differential privacy is typically ensured by perturbation with additive noise that is sampled from a known distribution. In this talk, we will discuss an additive noise mechanism for differential privacy that adds noise sampled from a new noise density called flipped Huber distribution. It is a hybrid density that resembles Laplace in the centre and Gaussian in the tail. With a sharper centre and light, sub-Gaussian tail, this density has the best characteristics of both distributions and renders a better trade-off between privacy and accuracy than other existing mechanisms. We theoretically analyze the proposed mechanism, and we derive the necessary and sufficient condition in one dimension and a sufficient condition in high dimensions for the mechanism to guarantee (Ïµ,Î´)-differential privacy. Numerical simulations corroborate the efficacy of the proposed mechanism compared to other existing mechanisms in achieving a better trade-off between privacy and accuracy.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/nzo-uyzr-egc  ','','',1,'2024-04-10 04:12:05','Active'),(71,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Hybrid Stochastic Modelling of Daily Precipitation and Daily Streamflow','Ms. Shalini B, Roll No. CE15D041','Ph.D Scholar','Dr. R.G.

This study presents a novel multistep methodology for stochastic simulation of streamflow time series, leveraging the PcStream clustering algorithm to dynamically manage temporal data clusters and adapt to concept drifts in the streamflow data. The proposed approach involves fitting kappa and GEV distributions to model daily variations and extreme values, followed by PcStream clustering to categorize streamflow data based on the probability distribution of flows. A Markov chain model is then employed to regenerate cluster series, and the nearest neighbour approach is used to fill the cluster series with historical data. The flow series is classified into rising, falling, or constant phases, and these phases are simulated to generate synthetic streamflow series that closely mirror observed dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by comparing observed and simulated flow statistics across various streamflow gage stations. Results show that the model successfully reproduces seasonal patterns, low flows, high flow extremes, autocorrelations, and flow duration curves. The approach captures the nuances of streamflow pulses by explicitly modeling rising, falling, and constant flow phases based on state classifications. The flexibility of PcStream to fine-tune its parameters allows for tailored clustering that accommodates the specific characteristics of streamflow data. This study introduces a sophisticated tool for understanding and predicting the complex dynamics of hydrological systems, integrating statistical modeling, unsupervised machine learning, and temporal sequence analysis to simulate complete streamflow series. The proposed multistep methodology offers a new approach for generating synthetic yet realistic streamflow scenarios, thereby enhancing water resource planning and management in an ever-changing environment.','R.

A unique feature of these ring systems is that they generally exhibit favourable structural and physicochemical properties. This characteristic made them appear to be appropriate functional group isosteres in place of other functional groups or ring systems. According to the study, replacing less desirable functional groups with azetidine and oxetane moieties can have a significant impact on PK/PD-related parameters. Introduction of a stable, small, and less lipophilic motif may lead to better fit in the receptor pockets, thereby blocking the active sites and enhancing intrinsic activity. Moreover, shielding nearby functional groups from chemical or metabolic susceptibility, without increasing lipophilicity. This study aims to explore the effect of replacing a large lipophilic substituent with a smaller, more polar group (i.e oxetane and azetidine) can improve metabolic stability and decrease the risk of adverse effects. Understanding these often drives both the lead optimisation and lead identification phases of a drug discovery program forward. In this contest virtual screening (VS) was performed on clinically approved drugs, including antineoplastic, anti-hyperglycaemic drugs, and NSAIDs, using AutoDock4 software for computer-aided drug screening. This analysis will help develop more potent drugs with better binding modes. Computational ADME prediction followed by synthesizing analogues and performing biological screening can yield promising results. Successful optimization of drug discovery programs requires identifying structural changes in leads that enhance potency. This study focuses on molecular modification as a strategy to identify new classes of lead compounds with superior pharmacotherapeutic activity, reducing the need for extensive synthetic work and increasing the likelihood of discovering more effective and safer medications.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-10 05:02:34','Active'),(75,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Static, dynamic analysis and prototype development using Aluminum 2024 alloy through additive manufacturing technology.','Mr. Saurabh Gairola, ED18D007','Ph.D. Scholar, Department of Engineering Design.

However, the additive\r\nmanufacturing of the additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy is scarce in literature due to its high\r\nsolidification cracking and low processing window. This is primarily due to the fact that the\r\ncomposition of the Al 2024 alloy is not well-suited for additive manufacturing. The high solidification\r\nrange of the Al 2024 alloy (135 K) coupled with the columnar grains formed in the additive\r\nmanufacturing due to extreme thermal gradient ( K/s) promotes solidification cracking along the grain\r\nboundaries in the additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy. The solidification cracking can be reduced\r\nby promoting the columnar to equiaxed transformation and by tailoring the composition that is better\r\nsuited for the additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy. The current study explores the Ti addition in Al\r\n2024 alloy as Ti has been conventionally used as the grain refining agent in the casting; however,\r\nstudies investigating the grain refining effect of Ti on additively manufactured Al alloy are scarce in\r\nthe literature.\r\nThe various mechanical properties such as tensile, hardness, fracture toughness, fatigue life, and\r\nfatigue crack growth behaviour were investigated for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) fabricated Ti-\r\nmodified Al 2024 alloy. The corresponding microstructural features were investigated with different\r\ncharacterisation techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron\r\nmicroscopy (TEM), electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The microstructural features such as\r\ngrain size, precipitate dislocation interaction, etc, were correlated with the mechanical properties of Ti\r\naddition in additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy. The fully equiaxed ultra-fine grained\r\nmicrostructure with an average grain size of 0.4 was observed in the alloy. The present work has\r\nshown that tensile strength, fracture toughness, and fatigue crack growth behaviour of the additively\r\nmanufactured Al 2024 alloy are comparable to the conventional wrought counterparts, and the yield\r\nstrength, hardness, and fracture toughness were better compared to the conventional wrought\r\ncounterparts.\r\nThe mechanical properties obtained were further utilised to design lightweight prototypes of\r\nstructural components of Al 2024 alloy for aerospace applications.

However, recent studies indicate that launching rockets from offshore platforms offers greater advantages compared to land-based launches. Primarily, this approach accommodates the diverse orbital inclination needs of satellites more effectively [1,2]. Furthermore, launching rockets from the sea offers environmentally friendly space launch options by reducing the risk to populated areas in case of launch failures or emergencies. Any emissions and noise produced during launch operations are dispersed across the ocean, potentially lessening their impact on terrestrial ecosystems and human populations. Consequently, deep ocean space launches come with notable benefits such as easy environment clearance and reduced public scrutiny. Despite these advantages, sea launches present unique challenges, necessitating specialized launch platforms capable of withstanding the impulsive forces of rocket propulsion and the harsh marine environment. Therefore, a multi-utility offshore platform must be designed, serving not only for traditional oil production and exploration but also for launching rockets. Developing such platforms for seaborne rocket launches enhances the nationâ€™s space exploration capabilities and contributes to economic growth. Repurposing offshore platforms for rocket launches, makes it suitable for launching satellites for earth exploration, space sciences, and meteorology. Therefore, the present research chose offshore triceratops for its desirable response characteristics. The platform is set apart by a novel ball and socket joint connecting the deck with the buoyant legs, which provides translational dependency between the deck and buoyant legs while ensuring the rotational independence between them. Design principles and analysis methods that govern the dynamics of offshore structures, in general, and Triceratops, in particular, are well-established [3-5]. As the seaborne launch exerts dynamic loading on the platform, the present research focuses on evaluating the dynamic response and stability of the deep ocean triceratops during the rocket launch, through both numerical simulations and experimental analyses.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING ','oeoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-10 06:57:20','Active'),(78,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\'\'CONTEMPORARY WORK AND EMPLOYEE VOICE & SILENCE BEHAVIOR: A VR AND PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION\".','Ms. Apoorva Goel, Roll no.

TRC elements can be lighter in weight, since non-ferrous reinforcements have lower density and require minimal clear cover. The reinforcement in TRC is typically textiles woven using continuous filaments/yarns and aligned in the direction of the tensile stresses, thus reducing the fibre volume up to 50% than that of conventional fibre reinforced concrete (FRC). Normally, TRC systems have AR-glass textiles, made with zirconium glass, to ensure adequate durability in the highly alkaline cementitious system (pH varies from 12.5 to 13). However, AR-glass is expensive and necessities the development of TRC with E-glass, which is available predominantly due to its application in GFRP (glass fibre reinforced polymer). The challenges associated with the development of TRC using E-glass arise from its degradation in the highly alkaline environment of concrete. The replacement of cement with SCMs could be promising due to the reduction in pH and increased rate of carbonation (reduction in pH of the concrete to less than 10 after carbonation). However, the lack of understanding of the mechanisms and rate of degradation of E-glass textiles in concrete with different SCMs, which govern the long-term performance of such composites, is evident. Coating of E-glass is common in textiles and the degradation mechanisms would be different from those of uncoated E-glass and AR-glass, which are not readily available in literature. \r\nThe current study focuses on understanding the mechanism of degradation and the performance of coating against dissolution in simulated pore solution of pH 13 using microstructural analysis. Further, the degradation of coated E-glass subjected to different pH and temperature is quantified in terms of loss of its tensile strength. A correlation among the rate of degradation, pH and temperature is established. The existing binders for AR-glass and E-glass are further optimized for the replacement of cement with SCMs to facilitate higher carbonation rates, necessary to lower the pH at a faster rate, along with adequate strength. Finally, the long-term mechanical performance of the coated E-glass composites will be assessed with the developed binders (with and without carbonation) under accelerated and natural aging conditions. Also, an analytical model to estimate the service life of E-glass TRC composites by incorporating the effect of various factors such as temperature, pH, and relative humidity will be developed. \r\nThis seminar summarizes the existing knowledge on the glass reinforcement, binders and long-term performance of the composites under various factors and lists out the research gaps in the literature. A detailed methodology of the current research along with the preliminary results will also be presented.\r\n','R.

Due to their omnipresence and unique reactivity, the functionalization of alkenes has become a powerful method for constructing complex organic molecules.[1] In this context, direct chelation-assisted C-H olefination at the inert C-H bonds represents the most straightforward synthetic method for introducing the alkenyl group into organic compounds in a highly regio- and stereoselective manner.[2] Despite the remarkable advances in chelation-assisted C-H olefination reaction, most of the successful transformations are restricted to activated or electronically biased olefins such as acrylates, styrenes, acrylamides, vinyl sulfones, and vinyl phosphonates.[3] Literature reports on chelation-assisted C-H olefination with unactivated or electronically unbiased alkenes are limited due to poor intrinsic reactivity and regioselectivity issues. Despite these notable challenges, highly selective C-H alkenylation and alkylation reactions of unactivated alkenes with the assistance of various directing groups have been achieved in the past few years.[4] Due to novel breakthroughs in this area, there are still limited examples of selective C-H functionalization of olefins. Realizing the need for a viable synthetic transformation for selective alkenylation and alkylation, we have demonstrated the ortho-alkenylation of benzimidates and chalcones with unactivated olefins. [5a,b] Furthermore, we also developed the methodology to synthesize 1H-isoindole derivatives via ortho-olefination followed by aza-Michael addition. On the other hand, we have also demonstrated the Ru-catalyzed ortho-alkylation of benzamides with unactivated olefins.

A variational quantum classifier (VQC) using ultrasonic phased arrays is proposed to extract weld defect features, improving the classification accuracy due to simultaneous qubits. The VQC is trained using a simulation-assisted weld dataset generated using finite element (FE) models and deep convolution generative adversarial networks (DCGAN). The total focusing method (TFM) weld images of porosity and slag are generated using time-transmitted signals received by performing full matrix capture and modeling various defect morphologies using FE simulations. These datasets are then fed to train a DCGAN to generate synthetic TFM images. A feature selection method is used to obtain the best results with a quantum circuit with minimal qubits. Prominent features obtained are supplied to the encoder circuit of the VQC to convert it to a quantum domain, thereby passing to an ansatz circuit to train quantum hyperparameters. The loss is computed for every iteration by optimizing the learnable parameters of the VQC. The VQC is trained by varying quantities of datasets to improve the reliability and efficiency of the weld defect classifications. It is found that VQC, with an accuracy of 96%, outperforms some of the classical machine learning algorithms.\r\n\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkThrough Zoom Meeting Link: https://us05web.zoom.us/j/8582580759?pwd=N0VXMEtlbFNNQ','','',1,'2024-04-11 15:37:43','Active'),(87,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Bio-ionic liquids based soft and adhesive Film for therapeutic applications','Kumari Kiran (BT21D124)','PhD scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Prof. Sanjib Senapati','Department of Biotechnology','2024/04/15 14:30','2024-04-15','','BT Seminar Hall','Bio-ionic liquids, often abbreviated as Bio-ILs, are a class of ionic liquids designed specifically for use in biological or biomedical applications.

The battery serves as the energy source in an electric vehicle due to its high energy density. However, it has a limitation in terms of low power density. Battery life is reduced when exposed to high peak power demand brought on by frequent vehicle acceleration and deceleration. Therefore, the battery is integrated with a supercapacitor to fulfill the high-power requirement. A power management algorithm is needed to effectively utilize both the battery and supercapacitor. This work proposes a power management scheme based on a rule-based filtering technique. The algorithm uses the current division factor based on the instantaneous power loss minimization technique to reduce the system\'s energy loss. In addition, the algorithm uses a novel control approach, which includes a low-pass filtering approach to regulate the supercapacitor SoC. With the proposed algorithm, the improvement is seen in terms of battery power loss and energy loss compared to the existing rule-based algorithm. The algorithm\'s workings and the comparison study are validated through MATLAB/SIMULINK. The experimental studies validated the feasibility of the proposed scheme.','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/pvd-gcqs-ddb','','',1,'2024-04-12 04:54:30','Active'),(89,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','The Semiotics of Contemporary Indian Cricket','Surya Nandana','Ph.D. Research Scholar','Guide: Prof  S P Dhanavel','Humanities and Social Sciences','2024/04/16 15:00','2024-04-16','','Google meet','\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis study examines the significatory practices involved in Indian cricket â€“ in today\r\nâ€™s world of flamboyant performance, affective intensity, dynamic sociocultural identities and functions, corporeality, materiality, digitisation, commercialisation and commemoration â€“ through the lens of Barthesian semiotics.\r\n\r\nThe literature review traces the development of Indian cricket and its sociocultural implications. Cricket histories and journalistic texts by veteran scholars like Ramachandra Guha, Boria Majumdar and Mihir Bose are supported by writings on various dimensions of sport, such as spectacle, stardom and narrativity, by theoreticians like Francis W.

This study applies Barthesian semiotics to analyse cricket matches as texts of human activity (Miles et al., 2014). The section on methodology, therefore, offers an overview of semiotics, Barthesâ€™ contribution to the domain of sociocultural semiotics, and the application of memory, affect and thing theory in this semiotic approach to Indian cricket.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Indian cricket, Barthesian semiotics, myth, memory, affect, thing theory\r\n ','HS office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/dqm-tqek-mwi ','','',1,'2024-04-12 04:59:12','Active'),(90,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Generalized rotational symmetry and angular momentum conservation','Prof V Balakrishnan','Prof. V Balakrishnan received his undergraduate degree from St. Stephenâ€™s College, Delhi and PhD from Brandeis University in 1970.

Historically, the design of service disciplines focused on optimizing the average linear functions of sojourn times (rewards). Although the goal of optimizing linear rewards is well investigated, hardly any work considers optimizing nonlinear rewards, which have become crucial in many emerging delay-sensitive applications, including quantum communication, multimedia streaming, and online service platforms. \r\n\r\nIn our work, we focus primarily on identifying a single service discipline that maximizes the long-term average of nonlinear rewards. In particular, we view this problem for two arrival models - the first is a burst arrival model, wherein all jobs arrive at the server at the same instant. We show that the shortest job first (SJF) discipline maximizes the average reward for any monotonic function of the sojourn times. In the second setting, jobs arrive according to some stochastic process with i.i.d. service requirements. This setting is significantly more challenging to analyze, and identifying an optimal discipline remains elusive. We introduce a new service discipline, shortest predicted sojourn time (SPST), and provide analytical guarantees under specific settings. Numerically, we demonstrate that SPST outperforms well-known disciplines across multiple settings.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-12 09:39:59','Active'),(99,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\"Synthetic Lipids with Tunable Polarity Characteristics for Drug Delivery Applications\"','Ms. Akshaya K V (CY17D025)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Muraleedharan K M, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/17 15:00','2024-04-17','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','Drug delivery vehicles are generally formed from lipids, polymers or metal-organic frameworks, and are used to modulate the ADMET profiles of therapeutic entities. Apart from being bio-compatible, supramolecular or macromolecular matrices thus formed should not only favour high drug entrapment but also allow the release of constituents in a controlled manner. Because of rapid resistance induction on using monotherapy, use of drug combination has become inevitable in most of the disease areas. This has necessitated the development of carriers which can entrap more than one drug. This is challenging since the final concentration of individual constituents at the target site depends on multiple factors which include their stability under physiological conditions, differences in release rates etc. Previous research from our laboratory has shown the potential of oxanorbornane-based amphiphiles for drug delivery applications.1 The present work focusses on specific modifications on the head group for achieving multi-drug delivery. Considering the therapeutic relevance of low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (gasotransmitter), we have conjugated 1,2-dithiol-3-thione unit to the head group of such synthetic lipids and have used the conjugate as a vehicle for ibuprofen.2a Conjugation of 5FA (Anti-cancer agent) to the head group and use of the conjugates for co-delivery of Doxorubicin, and alteration of the polarity characteristics of the head group to modulate the uptake and toxicity profile of Doxorubicin are the other areas investigated.2b\r\nReferences:\r\n1. a) Gadde, S.

Experiments are conducted in the Weber number\r\nrange of 179 - 929; the corresponding Reynolds numbers are 5253 - 12091. The profile\r\nof the droplet interface is studied. Assuming self-similarity in the internal flow at the\r\ndroplet interface, the profiles are scaled using appropriate scales. It is observed that\r\nthe profiles of the droplet interface at different points of time collapse close to each\r\nother when plotted in this manner. This observation is experimental evidence of the\r\nself-similarity of the internal flow in this phase. Based on this fact, kinetic\r\nenergy is estimated at the early stages of droplet impact. The surface energy is also estimated by assuming axisymmetric droplet profile obtained through back-light imaging. We observe that a considerable amount of kinetic energy is lost during the early stages of droplet impact. We believe that an accurate estimation of this deficit in kinetic energy at an early stage of impact will be necessary to account for the energy-based models for droplet impact. Also due to initial kinetic energy, the droplet rapidly spreads outward upon impact until the viscous dissipation and the surface tension force slow the spreading. After a period, the droplet spreads slower while the film thinning rate becomes stagnant, resulting in a residual thickness. A measurement technique using a Chromatic Confocal Sensor is used here for the thickness measurement. This sensor allows to measure droplet thickness with high precision. Using the information on early phase energy dissipation and experimental data on spreading diameter and thickness, a model can be developed to capture the temporal evolution of droplet diameter during spreading.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/bdx-wojv-dqa','','',1,'2024-04-12 10:07:25','Active'),(101,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\"Metal-Free Synthesis of Stable Imidazolium and Pyrrolium Salts: Comprehensive Investigation of their Chemical, Photophysical, and Redox Properties\"','Mr. Prathap R (CY19D006)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Dr. Kartik Chandra Mondal, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/17 16:00','2024-04-17','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','The Ïƒ-donor stable singlet CAAC/NHC carbene has been reacted with in situ generated electron hungry aryne leading to the formation of initial carbene-aryne intermediate which further undergoes aryl group migration from N-atom of carbene to arynes leading to air-stable cyclic imine/imidazole product with C2 blocking in very good to excellent yields.

Electrochemical energy storage systems such as supercapacitor present promising solutions for meeting the rising energy demands due to their high-power density and cyclic stability.1,2 There is a continuous quest for discovering new materials that can outperform conventional electrode materials, driving significant demand for researchers to explore nanoparticles.3 In this work, copper tellurate (Cu3TeO6) has been synthesized and investigated as novel active nanomaterial for electrode fabrication for energy storage device. Among various tellurium-based compounds, Cu3TeO6 nanoparticles show promise for high-performance battery-type supercapacitor.4 Combining the high electrical conductivity and tunability of copper with structural stability of tellurium holds promise for enhancing energy storage performance.5 The colloquium will cover a brief introduction on the working principle of supercapacitor, nanomaterials and their properties relevant to diverse energy applications. In the first part, synthesis, physicochemical characterization and application of Cu3TeO6 nanoparticles for charge storage will be discussed.6 In the later part, morphological variations of Cu3TeO6 induced by surfactants during the synthesis, and their effect on the size, shape, and porous structure, and finally on their performance as supercapacitor electrodes will be presented. Surfactants functionalize the surface of nanoparticles, altering their surface chemistry and improving their compatibility with electrolyte solutions. This enhances the overall electrochemical performance of the electrode material in terms of storage and long cycling life. Further, Cu3TeO6 composite with carbon is synthesized to further enhance the storage performance and stability. The synthesized Cu3TeO6 material is also evaluated for its activity towards methanol oxidation and photo-electrochemical water splitting.\r\nReference:\r\n1.	T. K. Ghosh, G.

A computational framework based on the open-source CFD library OpenFOAM to study these instabilities in the context of afterburners is developed. \r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on the numerical investigation of flame dynamics and the thermo-acoustic oscillations of the bluff body combustor known as the Single Flameholder Agumentor (SFA) test rig at the Georgia Institute of Technology. These experiments used vitiated and high-velocity inlet conditions (Oxygen 15%, T=800â° C, and M=0.2-0.4) with spray-injected non-premixed mode of combustion. In these experiments, longitudinal thermo-acoustic instabilities in the range of 200-250 Hz were encountered, along with high-frequency wake flame oscillations above 1000 Hz. First comparison of modelling results with experimental data from the non-reacting conditions from the SFA is presented. Following this, results for the reacting cases with three global equivalence ratios of 0.5, 0.7, and 1 are considered. The results are analyzed to get insights into the mean temperature profiles, flame structure, pressure oscillations, fuel penetration effects, and the amplitude of the BVK oscillations. In this work, the hybrid LES model is used; this offers the advantage of not necessitating extremely fine grids by switching to RANS-based models in the near-wall regions. The Lagrangian approach is used to track droplets from the liquid spray injection into the computational domain. The simulations are carried out using the compressible Navier-Stokes solver â€œsprayFoamâ€ which also allows for the modeling of Lagrangian parcel injection. \r\nThe non-reacting results show large velocities up to 400 m/s near the flameholder trailing edge in addition to a von Karman-type vortex shedding at a Strouhal number of 0.25.  The reacting flow results show variation in the flame topology depending on the fuel injection rates.  The simulations show large amplitude pressure oscillations at 250 Hz for the highest equivalence ratio case, mirroring the experimental observations. By applying the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) technique, we confirm the excitation of the Â¾ th longitudinal of the combustor during the instability. Furthermore, the DMD of the fuel mass fraction field also confirmed the oscillations in the spray stream at the thermoacoustic frequency, indicating a thermoacoustic coupling. Also, high frequency (>1200 Hz) oscillations of the wake flame due to flame holder vortex shedding are correctly reproduced in the simulations. \r\n\r\nThus, this part of the work forms a basis for the development of a comprehensive computational framework for predicting and diagnosing thermoacoustic instabilities in the context of afterburners using OpenFOAM. Further studies can build upon these findings to optimize afterburner design and mitigate thermo-acoustic instabilities.','Varunkumar S','varuns@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-14 06:27:23','Active'),(105,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','OFFSHORE TOPSIDE WITH STEEL AND FGM STIFFENED COPED BEAM','Mr. Thennavan M,OE21D004, Ph.D Scholar','Mr. Thennavan M,OE21D004, Ph.D Scholar','Prof. Srinivasan chandrasekaran - Guide','Ocean Engineering Department','2024/04/15 14:00','2024-04-15','','Seminar Hall, Department of Ocean Engineering','Coped steel beams are the preferred option for enhancing the functionality and structural integrity of an offshore topside. Implementing coping strategies helps prevent the accumulation of multiple pipelines and cables in the workspace. The steel coped beam experiences local yielding and buckling due to the combined effects of waves, wind, impact, and accidental loads, which result in high-stress concentration. Functionally-graded materials (FGM) are viable substitutes for structural components in unique circumstances. This study addresses the development of a new material for strengthening coped beams using functionally grading Stellite-6 steel, which is a highly corrosion-resistant alloy, with carbon-manganese steel. The mechanical properties of the newly developed FGM are evaluated and compared to those of the alloying materials to demonstrate their superiority. FGM samples are produced using Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM), a cost-effective method known for its high deposition rates. Tensile test specimens conforming to ASTM E8 standards are extracted from the FGM build to evaluate its structural properties. The newly developed FGM demonstrates approximately 50% higher yield strength and 48% higher ultimate strength compared to X52 steel. The suitability of FGM for offshore applications is confirmed by its advantages in terms of carbon equivalency and weldability. The FGM-stiffened coped beams are suggested as alternative options because of their improved structural characteristics and durable character. The current study utilizes FGM (Functionally Graded Materials) to reinforce the coped beam by incorporating stiffeners. The mechanical properties of the constituent materials, Stellite-6 and Carbon Manganese steel, are improved by functionally grading them to better suit structural engineering applications. This study investigates the microstructure evaluation and mechanical properties of FGMs (Functionally Graded Materials), specifically Stellite-6 and Carbon Manganese steel, which were produced using wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). Variation in thermal gradient during layer deposition affects microstructure, improving the novel FGM\'s structural properties over its constituents. The alloy grain structure, precipitated phases, and improved mechanical properties are evaluated using SEM analysis. Experimental investigations validate a notable decrease in the rate of corrosion in the functionally graded material (FGM) as a result of the inclusion of Stellite-6. Additionally, it enhances the strength and durability, qualities that are greatly desired for coped beam stiffeners. \r\nCoped beams are often used in the fabrication of land structures; however, the existence of coped regions significantly restricts the maximum load-bearing capacity and may even lead to unfavorable failure modes. This study aims to examine the recently introduced coped beam concept in offshore construction, as well as the failure modes of coped steel and FGM Stiffened beams. The steel beams with coping and the FGM-strengthened coped beam was produced and subjected to experimental evaluation. Furthermore, a finite element model was created and verified using the experimental data. Subsequently, a parametric analysis was performed to measure the impact of different cope geometries. The steel and FGM Stiffened coped beams were analyzed and compared using the 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method. The results were compared to both numerical and experimental data, and a strong correlation was observed. The maximum load for specimen CB-600 exceeds the maximum load for specimens CB-500 and CB-300 by 22% and 50% respectively. The duration of the post-peak and instability stages in specimen CP-600 is greater than that of specimens CB-500 and CB-300. The results demonstrate that the cope has an impact on the loading carrying capacity and buckling of coped beams with varying cope geometries. The parametric analysis results indicated that the shape of the cope had a significant impact on the structural performance of the steel beams. The Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique facilitated the quantification of strain and deformation in the steel-coped beams, yielding a valuable understanding of their response to various loading conditions. The comparison between numerical and experimental results further confirmed the precision of the finite element model, emphasizing its utility in predicting the performance of coped steel and FGM beams in offshore construction. The overall study highlights the importance of using new FGM materials in offshore topside and heavy industries that require coped beams to accommodate service mains.\r\n','Ocean Engineering Department','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-15 03:41:46','Active'),(106,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\'\'PROFITABLE MARKET MECHANISM FOR PLATFORM, BASED AGGREGATOR TAXI SERVICES\'\'','Mr. SWAMINATHAN RAMMOHAN, MS16D009','Ph.D. SCHOLAR','Prof. RAHUL R .

While the pioneering works of M. K. Geraghty and W. J. Carroll provided a fundamental understanding of this field, a multitude of studies in the past two decades have aimed to improve the profitability of taxi services. We begin with an extensive examination of contemporary literature concerning RM practices specifically applied in the taxi industry. The literature review is centered around essential aspects such as pricing mechanisms, market structure, business models, technological innovations, and marketing strategies. Through a comprehensive analysis of relevant research articles, this study aims to unveil novel trends and progressive research avenues in the domain of the taxi industry RM. Additionally, the literature review aims to identify significant gaps in existing literature, thereby paving the way for future investigations and scholarly exploration.\r\nBased on the literature review, it was evident that the selection of sales channels plays a critical role in the context of platform-based taxi services (PATS). Notably, PATS recently incorporated a variant of opaque selling known as group rides, where passengers with nearby pick-up and drop-off locations and coinciding departure times are grouped together for a single ride. Typically, PATS employ a listed price strategy for both regular and opaque channels, which limits passengers and drivers to accept or decline rides without any scope for further negotiation or engagement. To address this limitation, we propose the introduction of an alternative channel called \'Name Your Own Price\' (NYOP). This novel channel introduces a certain level of opacity regarding ride features and additional waiting time, while efficiently capturing the preferences of both passengers and drivers. The introduction of NYOP presents a valuable opportunity to accommodate passengers with lower ride valuations, who were previously excluded due to higher fixed prices. By enabling passengers to suggest their own prices, the NYOP channel facilitates the provision of rides at reduced rates, making transportation more accessible and affordable for a wider range of passengers.\r\nIn our first analytical model, we demonstrate that the increased level of opacity and additional waiting times in sales channels provided by the NYOP leads to improved passenger segmentation, resulting in higher revenue for the platform. Moreover, the NYOP channel creates additional ride opportunities for drivers, enabling them to generate extra revenue and\r\nachieve the incentive threshold set by the platform. Furthermore, our research delves into the decision-making processes of drivers when faced with the option of an NYOP channel in the presence of target-based incentives, providing valuable insights into their bidding behaviour.\r\nSubsequently, our second analytical study delves into the examination of driver behavior through the lens of PATS in the presence of market competition. If a driver has the choice of selecting a taxi ride when there are two platforms available, it is worth investigating the driver\'s switching behavior, especially in the presence of incentives. In this study, we propose a framework for optimally designing the platform policies in a duopoly market in the presence of driver incentives for completing a threshold number of rides in a given time period. Our analysis has uncovered a pattern in the decision-making of platform 1, and our findings indicate that platform 1 maximizes its utility by prioritizing the ease of sending rides to a driver when she is commencing her day, thus aligning its interests with the driver\'s goal of accumulating rides. However, as the driver approaches the target-based threshold for incentives, platform 1 diminishes its motivation to provide additional ride opportunities to the driver.\r\nOur contributions in the field of operations management play a crucial role in enhancing taxi utilization rates. Further, we provide recommendations to platforms for increasing the taxi market efficiency, especially during non-peak hours. In addition, we focus on understanding customer behavior by segmenting passengers based on their valuation, opacity quotient, and waiting times. Further, we introduce alternative pricing strategies and devise revenue maximization techniques for PATS. These contributions are aimed at optimizing the overall performance and effectiveness of the taxi industry during periods of lower demand, ultimately benefiting passengers, taxi drivers, and platforms.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION.-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadr','','',1,'2024-04-15 04:43:57','Active'),(107,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Integrative biology approach to unravel the mechanism of immunogenic response and protein assembly in  Dengue and Zika viruses','Jaya Vasavi P (BT21D402)','Ph.D. scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Dr. Sanjib Senapati (BT)','Department of Biotechnology','2024/04/17 15:30','2024-04-17','','BT Seminar Hall','Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are most prevalent mosquito-borne pathogens belonging to the Flaviviridae family. Globally, about 400 million DENV infections and nearly 40,000 deaths are reported every year. In 2015 alone, ZIKV affected over 200,000 individuals, causing Microcephaly and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. Despite their severity in transmission, no approved drugs/vaccines are available, presumably due to the structural complexity and lack of molecular-level insights of the virus particles. During viral infection, innate immune cells present degraded viral proteins via MHC proteins. T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognize these antigens presented by MHC, initiating a T-cell immune response. However, the underlying mechanism of triggered immune response during MHC-antigen-TCR interaction is unknown. Using coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we explore conformational changes in TCR that lead to T-cell immunogenicity and introduce Machine Learning strategies to extract important features. This can aid in the in-silico identification of viable viral antigens priming vaccine design. Another approach to inhibit viral infection is to rupture the virion assembly. Here, we investigate the self-assembly process of viral E proteins through accelerated MD simulations. Elucidating the atomic details of E protein dimerization could pave ways to examine various pockets for drug binding and, thus, to design drugs to inhibit DENV and ZIKV.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-15 04:56:23','Active'),(108,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Modeling failure of solids in fluid-structure interaction problems','Mr. S P Krishna Phanindra,  ED19D750','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Engineering Design','Dr. Shankar Ram C S (Chair)\r\n\r\nDr. Srikanth Vedantam  (Guide)\r\n\r\nDr.  Sandipan Bandyopadhyay,\r\n\r\nDr. R Jayaganthan\r\n\r\nDr. Sarith P Sathian, AM','Engineering Design Department','2024/04/15 16:30','2024-04-15','','Google Meet joining info Video call link: https://meet.google.com/jss-stdc-oxh','Modeling fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems is of great importance in diverse engineering areas.

The technology has established itself as a reliable energy storage mechanism over the past decade. Nevertheless, it continues to face challenges, including safety concerns, prolonged charging duration, and a decline in capacity over time. One of the major safety concerns is the lithium plating phenomenon encountered in lithium-ion batteries. Lithium plating is the reduction of lithium ions on the surface of the negative electrode while charging a lithium-ion battery. Lithium plating reaction can eventually lead to dendrite formation and shorting of the battery. The lithium plating phenomenon has been attributed to two major factors, viz. increased charging voltage and charging at low temperatures. Charging a battery under these conditions increases the concentration of lithium ions at the anode compared to what can be intercalated into the electrode. This leads to a drop in electrochemical potential, and the ions get reduced on the surface of the electrode.\r\n\r\nTo understand the degradation of lithium-ion batteries at different temperatures, a first-principles-based electro-thermal battery model was developed. The model incorporates two different parasitic side reactions: the lithium plating reaction and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formation reaction. These two reactions consume the lithium ions in the battery, leading to its degradation. The first principles-based model can detect changes in desired and undesired reactions at different temperatures. The model can also quantify the amount of lithium lost to the parasitic side reactions. Understanding these side reactions in the battery will help develop methodologies to mitigate its degradation while improving its safety.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','The Ph.D. RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM SEMINAR in respect of Mr. ARUN MUTHUKKUMARAN (CH19D751) will be held o','seminar15-04-2024 06:09','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar15-04-2024 06:09',1,'2024-04-15 06:09:27','Active'),(110,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\"Spectroscopic and Kinetic investigations of Aromatic, Aliphatic Volatile Organic Compounds, and Halogen Monoxide Using State-of-the-Art Experimental Techniques and Theoretical Methods\"','Mr. Prasanna Kumar Bej (CY18D098)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Rajakumar B, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/18 16:00','2024-04-18','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','The atmospheric oxidants, such as OH, Cl, NOx, or ozone, react with the relevant atmospheric substrate or transient species, forming radicals and stable products, which could potentially impact the environment by creating soot particles or aerosols. The pollutants reportedly have an impact on the human respiratory system as well as on the biotic world1.\r\nAromatic hydrocarbons like benzene, toluene, and xylene are oxidized to form resonance-stabilized radicals in the atmosphere. Among all the isomers of xylene, o-xylene is one of the most widely used isomers, which finds its usage in paints, adhesives, coating, etc. When o-xylene gets emitted into the atmosphere, it reacts with atmospheric oxidants and forms the resonance stabilized o-xylyl radical. The study involving the measurement of the absolute absorption cross-section of o-xylyl radical in the wavelength range of 460.1â€“475.1 nm using CRDS will be discussed1. The five-membered hetero-aromatic compounds like pyrrole, furan, and thiophene play a critical role in cloud formation, influencing cloud properties like albedo, lifetime and consequently affect the Earth\'s radiative balance. The experimental and theoretical temperature-dependent reaction kinetics of Cl-atom and OH-radical with methyl thiophene will be discussed as one part of the study.\r\nThe reduction of the ozone layer in the stratosphere is effectively facilitated by the emission of halogen compounds (X=F, Cl, Br, and I) from anthropogenic and artificial resources, mostly in coastal areas (2,3). The oxide substituent of these compounds, especially monoxides (XO), has a significant role in ozone depletion. Peroxy radicals, RO2 (R=H, CH3, C2H5, C3H7, etc.) are the primary consumers of halogen monoxides in the atmosphere. Therefore, one of the studies will encompass a discussion on the experimental and theoretical determination of reaction rates between propyl peroxy and iso-propyl peroxy with BrO radical, facilitated by CRDS methodology. Furthermore, a theoretical kinetic study of isoprene (known as Bio VOCs) with XO (Cl, Br, I) will be discussed to analyze the oxidation impact of isoprene.\r\nReferences:\r\n1)	Bej, P.

It oxidizes saturated fatty acyl-CoAs at the 9th position to create a double bond to synthesize monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), e.g., Palmitoleate and oleate. Two different isoforms of SCD have been identified in human tissues: SCD1 and SCD5. SCD1 is the major isoform, ubiquitously expressed, with a prevalence in adipose tissues and various organs such as the heart, brain, liver, and lungs. MUFAs act as a substrate for the synthesis of various lipids, including phospholipids (PLs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), triacylglycerols (TAGs), and cholesteryl esters (CEs), which act as a reactant for many essential components of biological membranes, as well as a cellular energy source and intracellular signaling molecules. Overexpression of SCD1 has been correlated with cancer aggressiveness and poor prognosis across tumors. SCD1 promotes the maintenance/acquisition of stem-like features, including chemoresistance and self-renewal. A strong correlation between SCD1 and tumor signaling, cellular energetics, membrane maintenance, and anti-ferroptosis activity is demonstrated by various studies in the literature. We hypothesize that developing a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) molecule against the SCD1 protein is expected to degrade SCD1 selectively in cancer cells. PROTAC is a hetero-bifunctional small molecule comprising a ligand binding to the protein of interest (POI), which is linked with another small molecule binding to E3 ligase through the spacer. Upon binding with both partners, E3 ligase is expected to facilitate ubiquitinylation on the protein of interest (POI). After ubiquitinylation, POI would undergo degradation via the 26S proteasomal pathway. Targeted protein degradation of SCD-1 in cancer cells, would be achieved by linking small molecule ligand of E3 ligase which is expressed exclusively or overexpressed in cancer cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-16 04:06:24','Active'),(118,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Mpemba effect: An anomalous relaxation phenomenon','R.

Such research provides insights into the impacts of extreme weather events on shorelines, aiding in better preparedness and coastal management strategies. This research primarily aims to develop a statistical model that forecasts the potential peak surge height near to the landfall location of cyclone along the Bay of Bengal (BoB). The peak surge height at the landfall location leads to more extensive coastal flooding and increased damage to coastal structures. However, numerical models predict storm surges but are computationally expensive for just predicting peak surge height. Machine Learning (ML) is more efficient but demands vast datasets for accuracy. To resolve this, a new approach is essentialâ€”efficient and accurate with minimal data. Introducing the Tropical Cyclone Surge Potential Index (TCSPI) utilizes readily available real-time atmospheric data and bathymetric data. A retrospective analysis of TCSPI using Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) data from 1990â€“2021, effectively captures historical events in the Bay of Bengal. This study also incorporated various regression-based Machine Learning (ML) models, rapidly predicts the potential peak surge height across the coastal BoB region using same input parameters provided to the TCSPI. Comparing observed peak surges with observation, TCSPI demonstrates relatively lower errors as compared to best performing regression-based ML model. \r\nFurther, this study aims to improve the cyclonic wind field to better forecast the surge and inundation. Many literatures emphasized cyclonic wind field since cyclonic winds play a fundamental role in predicting surges and flooding. Therefore, a more accurate depiction of these wind fields is crucial. Further, estimating ocean wave parameters in tropical areas is difficult due to the complexity of wind fields associated with tropical cyclones (TCs). Usually, parametric and global model wind fields are the two primary sources to acquire wind and pressure fields to estimate the storm surges. The parametric models usually depict a better wind field near the cyclone center. Unlike the parametric models, the wind fields from global models have better accuracy in the areas far away from the eye of the cyclone. Owing to this inconsistency, a blended wind field approach has been introduced. \r\n','Ocean Engineering Department','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-16 04:27:19','Active'),(120,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','From multi-modal data to systems-level modeling of cellular processes','Mr. Nilesh Anantha Subramanian, CS20D300','PhD.

While established models of such bioprocesses under healthy and perturbed (disease) states exist, critical gaps around double-disease states and MMÃ GRN interactions remain. Towards this end, we propose computational frameworks based on statistical models and constraint-based (linear optimization) techniques in the context of these two studies: \r\n\r\nI)  A systematic methodology using linear models to quantify disease-disease interaction (DDI) effects in immune response: Studies have shown that immune responses in a person suffering from two diseases (comorbidity) could be more complex than the union of responses to each disease occurring separately. A data-driven quantification of this complexity is lacking though. We propose a three-step computational framework based on linear models with interaction terms to analyze data from multiple groups of individuals (healthy group, single-disease patients, and double-disease group), to identify, quantify, and interpret the double-disease (DDI) markers. Application of this framework to helminth infection and diabetes revealed DDI markers like TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, and IL-2, etc., and IL-4/13 and IL-10 immune signaling pathways to be enriched in the target genes of these DDI markers. Our approach is generic and can be applied to dissect DDI mechanisms behind other comorbid conditions as well.\r\n\r\nII) Iterative surgery on a probabilistic causal network to model MMÃ GRN feedback: Integrated MM and GRN models can help predict the behavior of a complex biological system. Several works capture the information flow from GRN to MM via Boolean rules, however none model the feedback from MM to GRN. I will present an iterative algorithm that models this feedback via causal surgeries on a probabilistic GRN network and combines inference on this network with a known linear program representation of MM. I will also present preliminary results from the application of this integrated GRNÃŸÃ MM model on simulated and real-world datasets.\r\n\r\nI will conclude the talk with a perspective on how methods and insights from the above studies encourage the development of multi-omic predictive models of bioprocesses.

Despite holding 18% of the world\'s population, India possesses only 4% of the world\'s water resources. Beyond agriculture, the most water-intensive industries include the fashion and petrochemical sectors. According to the 2019 report by the World Resources Institute (WRI), Indian textile industries consume 1.6 billion litres of water daily, with the production of a single pair of jeans requiring around 2000 litres of water. Concurrently, petrochemical wastewater production amounts to 1.3 billion litres per day, with petroleum refineries typically generating approximately 1.5 times the volume of wastewater per unit of refined petroleum oil. UN-Water forecasts a 55% increase in water demand by 2050, including a 400% rise in manufacturing water demand. Without intervention, by 2040, global water scarcity may impede both quenching the world population\'s thirst and sustaining current energy solutions. NITI Aayog warns that 21 major cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, and Chennai, face severe water crises in India. Therefore, urgent action is required for sustainable development, necessitating innovative water purification technologies to treat industrial effluents for reuse and recycling. Such technologies must overcome existing limitations and tackle emerging pollutants.\r\nGas hydrate-based water purification, an innovative technology, shows significant promise due to its unique characteristics, utilizing crystalline structures formed by water and gas molecules under specific conditions to effectively remove contaminants. These hydrates demonstrate notable purification by selectively eliminating contaminants from their structure. Additionally, aerogels have the ability to adsorb contaminants such as emerging pollutants, heavy metals, organic pollutants, and dyes from water, making them valuable in industrial water purification. This study explores the application of gas hydrates and aerogel for the purification of petrochemical complex effluent and textile effluent, offering a pathway towards sustainable water management in industrial settings.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/svp-iofa-hjk','seminar16-04-2024 04:55','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar16-04-2024 04:55',1,'2024-04-16 04:55:54','Active'),(122,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Numerical Investigation of  Shock/Boundary Layer Interaction and Its Control in an Axisymmetric  Inlet','Mr.Mohd Shahid Habib Khan','MS Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','Dr.Santanu Ghosh - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/04/17 15:00','2024-04-17','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/ejw-wdmy-fqs','','',1,'2024-04-16 05:10:44','Active'),(123,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF PILE SUPPORTED INTEGRAL ABUTMENT','Mr. Akshay T Sakhare, Roll No: CE15D072','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. G R Dodagoudar - Guide, Dr. Sanjay Nimbalkar, UTS - Co Guide, Dr. B Nageswara Rao - DC Member, Dr. S T G Raghukanth - DC Member, Dr. K V Nagendra Gopal, AE - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/04/18 10:00','2024-04-18','yes','Conference Room (BSB 104)','','Mathangi G','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-16 05:33:06','Active'),(124,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','DESIGN OF ORIGAMI-INSPIRED METAMATERIALS WITH PROGRAMMABLE POISSON EFFECTS','Mr. V Siva Poornan, Roll No: CE19D750','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. Phanisri Pradeep Pratapa - Guide, Dr. A Meher Prasad - DC member, Dr. U Saravanan - DC Member, Dr. G Saravanan Kumar, ED - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/04/26 15:00','2024-04-26','yes','Conference Room (BSB 104)','','Mathangi G','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-16 06:08:18','Active'),(125,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','System-level Investigation of Multilayered-packed Bed Thermocline Tank for CSP Plants ','Mr. Jawahar V (ME11D026)','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide: Prof. K.

In order to make the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants self-reliant and to overcome the intermittent availability of solar energy during unprecedented weather conditions, the requirement of the Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system is becoming starkly indispensable. A single-tank packed-bed thermocline TES system has the potential and economic advantage of replacing two-tank storage systems. Due to the threshold temperature imposed at the end of each charging and discharging process, the use of single fillers in thermocline systems is found to have a reduced utilization ratio and capacity factor, which compromises the thermal efficiency of the TES systems. A multi-layered packed bed system is a feasible option for addressing the poor capacity factor and utilization ratio, with improved thermal efficiency and plant efficiency close to two-tank systems. A comprehensive numerical study is carried out for a 275 MWht tank using two-dimensional, two-phase local thermal non-equilibrium models. Six different configurations are considered for the study and comparison of the options for multi-layered systems in CSP plants. In the first part of the study, a detailed parametric study was carried out using The effect of parameters such as the size of the filler, HTF inlet velocity, inlet fluid temperature, the hot storage bed temperature, porosity of the packed bed, and PCT of the PCM on the performance of TES system is studied. From the study, it is understood that it is desirable to select a filler of a smaller size due to the better charging and discharging rate over a bigger capsule size. The effective charging and discharging time is reduced from 92% to 87% with an increase in capsule size. At higher HTF velocities, the thermocline expands rapidly, adversely affecting the thermal performance of the system. It was found that the effective discharging time decreased to 82% with an increase in HTF velocity. The study of inlet HTF temperature and hot storage temperature shows that âˆ†T has a profound effect on the system\'s performance. The performance of the system reduces drastically when the âˆ†T is increased from 75 to 150 0C. The system is found to perform effectively at a lower âˆ†T. It is prudent to select PCM with a higher PCT temperature, precisely close to the cut-off temperature. It is also inferred from the study that a uniform temperature distribution can be achieved in a radial direction by insulating the tank with a multi-layered wall.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/yej-jhwy-ocd','','',1,'2024-04-16 07:10:33','Active'),(126,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Circular 4-coloring of signed graphs and complexity of near-3 choosability','Ms. Rohini S, MA17D017','Research Scholars, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','DC Members: Dr. A.V.

The battery serves as the energy source in an electric vehicle due to its high energy density. However, it has a limitation in terms of low power density. Battery life is reduced when exposed to high peak power demand brought on by frequent vehicle acceleration and deceleration. Therefore, the battery is integrated with a supercapacitor to fulfill the high-power requirement. A power management algorithm is needed to effectively utilize both the battery and supercapacitor. This work proposes a power management scheme based on a rule-based filtering technique. The algorithm uses the current division factor based on the instantaneous power loss minimization technique to reduce the system\'s energy loss. In addition, the algorithm uses a novel control approach, which includes a low-pass filtering approach to regulate the supercapacitor SoC. With the proposed algorithm, the improvement is seen in terms of battery power loss and energy loss compared to the existing rule-based algorithm. The algorithm\'s workings and the comparison study are validated through MATLAB/SIMULINK.

In order to make the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants self-reliant and to overcome the intermittent availability of solar energy during unprecedented weather conditions, the requirement of the Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system is becoming starkly indispensable. A single-tank packed-bed thermocline TES system has the potential and economic advantage of replacing two-tank storage systems. Due to the threshold temperature imposed at the end of each charging and discharging process, the use of single fillers in thermocline systems is found to have a reduced utilization ratio and capacity factor, which compromises the thermal efficiency of the TES systems. A multi-layered packed bed system is a feasible option for addressing the poor capacity factor and utilization ratio, with improved thermal efficiency and plant efficiency close to two-tank systems. A comprehensive numerical study is carried out for a 275 MWht tank using two-dimensional, two-phase local thermal non-equilibrium models. Six different configurations are considered for the study and comparison of the options for multi-layered systems in CSP plants. In the first part of the study, a detailed parametric study was carried out using The effect of parameters such as the size of the filler, HTF inlet velocity, inlet fluid temperature, the hot storage bed temperature, porosity of the packed bed, and PCT of the PCM on the performance of TES system is studied. From the study, it is understood that it is desirable to select a filler of a smaller size due to the better charging and discharging rate over a bigger capsule size. The effective charging and discharging time is reduced from 92% to 87% with an increase in capsule size. At higher HTF velocities, the thermocline expands rapidly, adversely affecting the thermal performance of the system. It was found that the effective discharging time decreased to 82% with an increase in HTF velocity. The study of inlet HTF temperature and hot storage temperature shows that âˆ†T has a profound effect on the system\'s performance. The performance of the system reduces drastically when the âˆ†T is increased from 75 to 150 0C. The system is found to perform effectively at a lower âˆ†T. It is prudent to select PCM with a higher PCT temperature, precisely close to the cut-off temperature. It is also inferred from the study that a uniform temperature distribution can be achieved in a radial direction by insulating the tank with a multi-layered wall.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/yej-jhwy-ocd','','',1,'2024-04-16 10:22:28','Active'),(129,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Novel Approaches for Heterogeneity Aware Topology Design in Decentralized Federated Learning','Mr. Jayavardhan Kondapalli, Roll No: CS21S011','MS Research Scholar','Dr. Sutanu Chakraborti - GTC Chair, Dr. Chandrashekar Lakshminarayanan - Guide, Dr. John Augustine - Co Guide, GTC Members: Dr. Kartik Nagar - CSE, Dr. Sameen A - AE.','Department of Computer Science & Engineering','2024/04/23 15:30','2024-04-23','','MR - I (SSB 233, First Floor)','In federated learning, models are trained across nodes while preserving data privacy. Centralized federated learning operates with a central server coordinating model updates across nodes, while decentralized federated learning operates in a peer-to-peer manner and models are trained by distributed stochastic gradient descent (DSGD). It is known that the success of DSGD depends critically on the underlying topology specified by a mixing matrix. Another factor that affects DSGS is data heterogeneity, a term used to denote the fact that the local data distribution of the individual nodes is different from the overall population distribution. Designing the right mixing matrix which balances such data heterogeneity is key for the success of DSGD. Recently an algorithm called Sparse Topology Learning - Frank Wolfe (STL-FW) was proposed to tackle data heterogeneity. At the start of training, STL-FW computes a sparse mixing matrix by optimizing an objective which combines the spectral gap and data heterogeneity.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we address two important shortcomings of STL-FW. Firstly, the topology returned by STL-FW may not be realizable in practice due to physical constraints. We propose a novel variant called Constrained Topology Learning - Frank Wolfe (CTL-FW) to compute an optimal mixing matrix which respects the underlying topological constraints. Secondly, during training, the local models exhibit heterogeneity. However, the mixing matrix computed by STL-FW at the start may not be sufficient to mitigate model heterogeneity occurring during training. We propose a novel variant called Dynamic Constrained Topology Learning - Frank Wolfe (DCTL-FW) which uses the test accuracies of the local models to compute a new mixing matrix every round. We show that DSGD performs better when it uses mixing matrices computed by CTL-FW and DCTL-FW in comparison to random mixing matrices (of the same topology) via experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets.','Hema G, CS Office','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-16 11:16:46','Active'),(130,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€œSOME NOVEL FRACTAL FUNCTIONS AND FRACTAL RADIAL BASIS FUNCTIONS: APPLICATIONS AND INSIGHTS â€ ','Mr. Deependra Kumar, MA19D014','Research Scholar, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','DC Members: Dr. Satyajit Roy Dr. Shruti Dubey / Dr. K.

Various oil extraction mechanisms are used for this purpose. Our study proposes an oil extraction structure and examines how channel parameters, especially height relative to droplet size, impact droplet clustering. Smaller droplets, relative to channel dimensions, follow continuous flow dynamics, allowing for simple hydrodynamic resistive modelling to estimate their parameters. However, when droplet diameter exceeds channel height, their dynamics deviate significantly, requiring a more complex modelling approach. The integration of sedimentation and hindrance theory, along with the consideration of relative hindrance (H) of a droplet due to its proximity to neighbouring droplets, has significantly improved the prediction of droplet parameters for densely packed droplets. Finally, the developed microfluidic platform enables high-throughput (200-400 droplets per second) droplet clustering for incubating (for about 30-70 minutes) a large number of cell-encapsulated droplets (about millions) efficiently.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/qgw-waew-jqr','','',1,'2024-04-17 04:37:35','Active'),(132,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Reduced-order models to predict mesoscale mechanical behavior of polycrystalline materials','Mr. K Vineet Kumar Reddy (AM17D026)','Ph.

The fatigue properties of polycrystalline metals are dictated by the mesoscale mechanical response (stress and strain) of the material to the applied load. Full-field solutions at the mesoscale, involving constitutive equations of crystal plasticity, are computationally expensive. Therefore, this dissertation aims to develop reduced-order models to efficiently: a) represent the material microstructure; and b) predict the mesoscale mechanical response of polycrystalline material.\r\n\r\nThe standard mathematical representation of polycrystalline microstructure comprises the lattice orientation field. For computational purposes, the microstructural domains are typically discretized into sub-grain size voxels, rendering the lattice orientation field a high-dimensional representation. The first part of this thesis explored two alternative low-dimensional representations based on: 1) input parameters associated with Voronoi tessellation; and 2) principal component analysis. However, both these approaches prove inadequate for the current purpose. In view of this observation, low-rank approximation (LRA), a technique suitable for high-dimensional inputs, was investigated. Specifically, a rank-one approximation of the localization tensor was developed to predict the mesoscale strain field within the elastic constitutive framework. The voxel-level strains predicted by the rank-one approximation closely match the crystal plasticity fast Fourier transform (CPFFT) solver.\r\n\r\nMetal fatigue is associated with the accumulation of plastic strains in grains. Thus, in fatigue-related applications, it is often necessary, and sufficient, to compute stresses and strains averaged over grains. Therefore, a data-science-based reduced-order model was developed to predict the grain-averaged state of stress. Towards this, a novel statistical representation called the grain-neighborhood function was constructed, which captures the occurrence frequency of various lattice orientations in the vicinity of the crystal grain of interest. The proposed methodology agrees with results obtained using crystal plasticity simulations for polycrystalline aggregates subjected to uniaxial deformation. The last part of the thesis shows that transfer learning can adapt the above model to new textures and morphologies using a limited amount of new training data.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle link : https://meet.google.com/civ-ugnb-yov','','',1,'2024-04-17 04:54:51','Active'),(133,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','INDOOR AIR POLLUTION CHARACTERISTICS, HEALTH IMPACTS AND MITIGATION OPTIONS FOR BIOMASS EMISSIONS FROM COOKING ACTIVITIES IN RURAL HOUSEHOLD KITCHENS IN INDIA','Ms. Gopika I, Roll No: CE18D405','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. S M Shiva Nagendra - Guide, Dr. Ligy Philip - DC Member, Dr. S Mathava Kumar - DC Member, Dr. Smita Srivastava, BT - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/04/23 11:15','2024-04-23','yes','Conference Room (BSB 104)','','Mathangi G','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-17 05:16:20','Active'),(134,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Flexible antennas for targeted hyperthermia treatment of cervical cancer through microwave transparent intrauterine tandem','Mr. Shabeeb Ahamed KP (BT15D050)','Ph.D. Research Scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Prof. Kavitha Arunachalam\r\nCo-Guide: Dr. Thomas Samuel Ram (CMC Vellore)\r\n','Department of Biotechnology','2024/04/18 15:00','2024-04-18','','Google Meet - https://meet.google.com/jsh-moic-pog','Locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be a socio-economic burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as India, with poor disease prognosis, and it demands affordable adjuvant treatment options. Microwave (MW) hyperthermia (HT), which involves selective heating of malignant tumour to 40-44 â„ƒ for 60 minutes has shown to improve treatment outcomes for cervical cancer when combined with radiotherapy. Commercial phased array HT device is not affordable for LMICs. This thesis presents a custom designed microwave transparent intrauterine tandem and flexible antennas for delivering intracavitary HT (IHT) at the cervix as an adjuvant therapy for high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy (BT) to improve clinical outcomes for LACC patients in LMIC. \r\nMajor challenge addressed in this research is the design and development of low-profile coaxial flexible antennas with broadband choke and water circulation ports for guidance through an intrauterine tandem with bend angle for targeted IHT delivery at the cervix. In comparison with a conventional coaxial balun, ferrite sleeve as a choke offered larger bandwidth and localized specific absorption rate (SAR) within the -15 dB bandwidth of coaxial monopole antennas, but it with an 11% lower maximum SAR than the resonant coaxial balun. Coaxial antennas with 3ï¬/8 active length and localized power deposition characteristics were realized using broadband flexible ferrite sheet as the choke. Flexible single and multi-band antennas were developed to deliver spatially varying thermal dose to address the variatons in tumor dimensions and patient anatomy. The flexible ferrite sheet is electrically small (0.46ï¬ ) compared to the resonant balun designs reported in literature and was demonstrated to effectively choke the secondary current on the coaxial MW antennas over a broad operating frquency (700-2450 MHz), where ï¬ is the effective wavelength of the medium surrounding the antenna. The broadband operation of the low profile ferrite choke was demonstrated for flexible single and multiband resonant antennas operating over 700-2450 MHz. Hyperthermia treatment delivery technique with frequency hopping and control of dwell time and delivered power was proposed to realize spatially varying localized power deposition and steady state thermal dose using multiband flexible antennas. \r\nThe fabricated prototypes of the intrauterine tandem of 8 mm diameter and 250 mm length and flexible antennas were assessed on tissue phantoms and ex-vivo bovine muscle tissues. Phantom and ex vivo tissue heating experiments demonstrated that the intrauterine tandem applicator with flexible antennas is capable of delivering localized power deposition at the target in agreement with the numerical simulations. The target volume at the cervix was 62.5 cm3 at 700 MHz and 18.3 cm3 at 2450 MHz, respectively for antennas with single resonance. For dual band antenna with resonance at 700 and 1300 MHz, tumor target volume could be varied from 28.5 to 62.4 cm3 by controlling the excitation frequency, dwell time and delivered power.  It is concluded that the antenna designs and IHT treatment delivery technique developed in this research could be used to deliver targeted IHT to the cervix. Furthermore, the proposed MW antennas and treament technique could be used to design combined intrauterine tandem applicator for delivering MW IHT and HDR BT to the cervix in sequential mode.\r\nPublications:\r\n	K.

The parasite uses differential gene expression mechanisms as strategies to adapt to different niches. Among them, parasites rely heavily on epigenetic-mediated mechanisms for controlling chromatin organization, gene regulation, morphological differentiation, and antigenic variation. The epigenome of P. falciparum is distinct from mammals as it has few transcription factors, thus tight regulation of gene expression largely depends on the nature of the chromatin structure in the parasite. Most of the research has been focused on post-translational modifications in the N-terminal tail of histones, the PTMs present within the globular domain are less well understood. How the PTMs in these domains affect chromatin-templated processes is not clear. Emerging reports have confirmed that P. falciparum chromatin harbors many modifications at unconventional residues.

High solubility is attributed to the small distortion oxygen interstitials exert \r\non these metals [2]. Similarly higher solubility of C in FCC Fe compared to BCC Fe is \r\nattributed to a small amount of strain exerted by C on Fe. But C and N interstitials prefer to be \r\nat the tetrahedral position compared to the octahedral position in metals like Pt [3]. Although \r\nthe lattice parameter of Pt is much smaller than that of Ti, N prefers to occupy an octahedral \r\nposition in Ti while it prefers to occupy a tetrahedral position in Pt. This observation is \r\ncounterintuitive to the established notion, that distortion plays a major role in the stability of \r\ninterstitials. In this work, we explore the role of the distortion and electronic binding energy of \r\nboron, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon interstitials and their relative stability in the octahedral \r\nand tetrahedral, and substitutional sites in bulk and at the surfaces. \r\nWe show that distortion alone does not play a role in the preference of a site of solute \r\natoms. These results help us understand the limitations of the thumb rule (larger atoms will \r\noccupy a larger site, and smaller ones will occupy smaller sites) and the size of space available \r\nat various sites in Fe. While B follows the thumb rule, the genesis of O\'s occupation of the Octa \r\nsite lies in the strong bonding to Fe in the Octa environment. We showed that B does not bind \r\nstrongly to Fe, and its stability is dictated by distortion alone, which could explain the \r\npreference of B to segregate at large open volumes, like grain boundary. C, N, and O form \r\nstrong bonds with Fe and have strong environmental dependence. O bonding at the Octa site is \r\nstrong enough to overcome the largest distortion among various sites in bulk Fe and stabilize \r\nthere. We also show that solute atoms could not be assumed to be a hard-sphere with fixed \r\nvolume as suggested by calculated radii. We show that the size of the atom changes when \r\nplaced in different sites in Fe, this is due to different amount of charge transfer from Fe to \r\nsolute atoms. \r\nInterstitial formation energy of oxygen atoms at their most preferred site in TM elements \r\nbecome more positive, as one move from left to right in the periodic table. Interstial formation \r\nenergy is positive for Ni, Cu, Mo, W, Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Pt, and Au. As the volume \r\navailable at either octahedral or tetrahedral site in TM decreases as one move from left to right, \r\none would expect that more positive interstitial formation energy is due to large distortion \r\nenergy. But we found that oxygen prefers tetrahedral sites in Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ta, W, Re, Os, \r\nIr, Pt, and Au, where distortion energy is higher. This suggest that distortion energy alone does \r\nnot control preference for a site. In fact, for In, Pt, and Au electronic binding energy is positive \r\nat both octahedral and tetrahedral site, oxygen is stable at tetrahedral site because electronic \r\nbinding energy is less positive at tetrahedral site. \r\nWe find that adsorption energy of oxygen, on the surfaces is more negative than their formation \r\nenergies at most stable site in the bulk. This is due to both low distortion energy at the surface \r\nand more negative electronic binding energy at the surface. This is particularly important for \r\nelements that have positive interstials formation energy in the bulk. Adsorption energy of \r\noxygen on surface of all these elements is negative. This suggests that oxygen will adsorb on \r\nthe surface but will not from interstial in the bulk. This explains why metals like, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, \r\nNb, Ta forms oxygen solid solution while other TM do not. But catalytic metals like, Pt, Pd, \r\nCu, Ni does facilitate catalytic reactions by adsorption of oxygen on the surface but oxygen \r\ndoes not get absorbed in the bulk.\r\n[1] R.W. Cahn, P.

This is primarily because it eliminates the need for the traditional method of functional group interconversion and permits the direct functionalization of the Câ€“H bond.1 With this strategy, a lot of multistep synthesis processes may be reduced to single steps; that is, a molecule\'s specific Câ€“H bond could be targeted and functionalized, providing direct access to late-stage functionalization and the synthesis of several bioactive and natural compounds. Aside from additives and solvents at a specific temperature, this technique also requires an external oxidant, typically a metal-based one. In this context, Redox-neutral C-H functionalization has emerged as a powerful tool in organic synthesis, enabling the direct installation of diverse functional groups without the need for external oxidants or reductants.2 Among all these transition metals, the charm of using cobalt complexes for catalysis has substantially increased as a result of high performance at low cost, and its combination with the internal oxidant strategy has been found wide applications for annulation reactions in the last few years.3 In this seminar, the developments made in high-valent Cp*Co(III) catalysis using the redox-neutral strategy will be discussed.\r\n \r\nReferences: \r\n1.

This ability has been capitalized to reconstitute synthetic binary/ternary lipoprotein complexes composed of apolipoproteins/peptides and lipids. The complexes are called nanodiscs and mimic native high-density lipoproteins (HDL), also known as the â€œgood cholesterolâ€. The cholesterol-accepting and transporting property of HDL has been reconfigured to develop nanodiscs as platforms for different types of molecular cargoes that have been loaded into the core for various applications.

This work culminates these research efforts to construct a comprehensive and robust surrogate kinetic model for various biodiesel fuels. In order to accurately reproduce the combustion characteristics of biodiesel, methyl butanoate, methyl crotonate, 3-hexene, and n-dodecane are chosen as surrogate components. These molecules have been chosen to replicate the functional groups found in biodiesel methyl esters. Each surrogate component is firstly validated thoroughly against a wide array of experimental studies. The kinetics of each component are improved through careful rate assignments derived from various theoretical investigations available in the literature. Subsequently, a surrogate mixture comprising these selected components is formulated by matching the functional groups of target fuels. This surrogate mechanism is used to validate the experimental data associated with various biodiesel fuels, their constituents, and methyl esters exhibiting similar functional groups to those present in actual biodiesel. The current kinetic model has demonstrated good agreement for various biodiesel fuels and its surrogates for a range of experimental studies. This comprehensive model can be reduced to obtain shorter models for biodiesel kinetics as required for specific applications. Apart from biodiesel, the surrogate components investigated as a part of this work are also suitable as representative molecules for transportation fuels with similar functional groups.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/jfe-nwhp-kns','','',1,'2024-04-20 04:42:20','Active'),(148,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Failure Mechanisms and Long-Term Performance Parameters of Galvanic Anodes for Reinforced Concrete Applications','Ms. Ananya S Ajayan, Roll No. CE21S001','M.S Scholar','Dr. Radhakrishna G Pillai â€“ Guide, \r\nDr. Piyush Chaunsali â€“ GTC Member,\r\nDr. Nilanjan Saha, OE â€“ GTC Member\r\nDr. Benny Raphael â€“ Chairperson & Head\r\n','Civil Engineering','2024/04/23 16:00','2024-04-23','yes','BSB 104 (Conference Room)','Corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete is an alarming durability issue at present. According to the NACE Impact Report 2016, 4.2% of Indiaâ€™s GDP is spent on corrosion and its associated material loss, repair, and maintenance. Less durable and hence, repeated repair interventions without considering the root cause of failure also contribute to this cost and the associated material wastage. Electrochemical repair intervention using galvanic anodes is a promising solution to prevent/control corrosion in reinforced concrete.\r\n\r\nGalvanic anodes consist of a zinc piece, an encapsulating mortar, and metallic tie wires attached to the zinc. The encapsulating mortar should have a high pH (>13.1) to facilitate the active corrosion of zinc and to dissolve and transport zinc corrosion products away from it. It should be highly porous, with interconnected pores that accumulate the corrosion products. But, with the duration of exposure, the pH reduces, and corrosion products precipitate and clog the pores. This reduces the performance (output current) of anodesâ€”leading to premature failure of the repair. Premature failure is often seen with the use of inferior galvanic anodes in the market. To improve the design of galvanic anodes, more literature on the crucial parameters affecting their long-term performance is required. \r\n\r\nThis presentation will discuss the time-dependent performance of galvanic anodes extracted from field structures of ages 3, 12 and 18 years, and in chloride and low-pH conditions. Along with those, the critical parameters for evaluating the performance of galvanic anodes will be presented, i.e., physical, chemical and electrochemical characteristics of galvanic anodes and the behaviour of steel-concrete interface upon cathodic protection. Part of this presentation will also discuss how to relate this performance data with the artificial ageing of anodes in regard to a laboratory test developed in-house (Galvanic Anode Performance test) to assess the performance of galvanic anodes. \r\n','R.

However, the dominant line of academic research in developing countries adopts an external lens linking institutional policies and stakeholder pressure to firmsâ€™ sustainability performance (Jabbour et al., 2020). Research efforts that examine the leveraging of intrinsic organizational capabilities to enhance sustainability performance are still insufficiently systematized (Bezerra et al., 2020; Buzzao & Rizzi, 2021). Although India â€œmissed the manufacturing busâ€ and transitioned to a service-based economy, much of the ecological footprint and resource consumption has been attributed to the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\nBased on a comprehensive literature review that helped formulate the research objectives, a series of independent studies were built around the theoretical framework of the Dynamic Capability View (Teece et al., 1997) to explore and examine how sustainability capabilities can be developed in the context of the Indian manufacturing sector. Study 1 employs a case study-based design and TISM-MICMAC to gain insights into how sustainability capabilities emerge in young manufacturing firms (N=12). Study 2 utilizes a cross-sectional survey in listed manufacturing firms (N=242) to examine how incumbent firms rejuvenate their sustainability capabilities by aligning their extant capabilities under diverse firm conditions. Study 3 uses a Policy Delphi instrument, which captures consensus and dissent among multiple stakeholders, namely entrepreneurs, corporate leaders in manufacturing, and other ecosystem enablers (N=60), to investigate how young and incumbent firms collaborate to foster sustainability.\r\n\r\nThese studies provide a picture of how building dynamic sustainability capabilities require resource recombination and co-specialization, and they also advance the paradigm that capability building is too complex to be viewed as a direct linear flow. The findings from the research can provide strategic direction to managers embracing sustainability capabilities as part of their firm strategy. For policymakers, these studies can act as a guide to identifying the right policy and intervention mix to balance triple bottom-line objectives.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','SEMINAR - II (RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM)-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-i','','',1,'2024-04-20 11:02:04','Active'),(151,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Embedded devices to identify and assist the hearing impaired','Velmurugan S','Velmurugan S has been a project staff at the Assistive Tech Lab, in EE, for the past few years while pursuing his MS.

The operational demands of machinery frequently result in speed fluctuations, leading to spectral smearing, thereby compromising the efficiency of the analysis methodology. Furthermore, the intricacies of parameter initialisation often increase the complexity of the analysis methods. The present study introduces a fault diagnosis algorithm that requires minimal initialisation and operates independently of tacho-pulses. The algorithm proposed in the study incorporates Variational Mode Extraction with the Maxima Tracking Algorithm for Instantaneous Frequency estimation. Hankel matrix-based selective spectral fusion is proposed to mitigate the impact of frequency tracking errors caused by transient noise.

The selective activation of ortho-methyl C(sp3)ï€­H bond instead of ortho-C(sp2)ï€­H bond is highly challenging due to the facile formation of a five-membered palladacycle as compared with a six-membered palladacycle. However, under a prominent reaction condition and by using an external ligand we have developed [3+2] annulation of substituted aromatic acids with maleimides which leads to tricyclic heterocyclic molecules with good to excellent yields.3a The reaction proceeds via a dual Cï€­H bond activation where the first C(sp3)ï€­H activation takes place selectively at the benzylic position followed by a second C(sp2)ï€­H bond activation at the meta-position to afford a five-membered cyclic ring. Similarly, weakly coordinating aromatic amides, ketones and ester have been successfully utilized for this [3+2] annulation reaction.3b In recent years, direct Câˆ’H functionalization of aliphatic carboxylic acids without incorporating any exogenous directing groups has shown significant progress.4 Moreover, the usage of less reactive allyl alcohols in aliphatic Câˆ’H functionalization is very scarce. Therefore, to increase the scope and practical application of allyl alcohols in C(sp3)âˆ’H activation, we started our investigation with ï¢-C(sp3)âˆ’H containing aliphatic acids. The reaction offered five-membered Î³-lactones containing an alkyl ketone moiety at the Î³-position and an external bis-coordinated ligand is crucial for the success of this protocol.\r\nReferences: [1] Yang, Y.; Lan, J.; You, J.

High efficiency, wider fuel flexibility, modular design and environment friendly exhaust make SOFCs favourite for auxiliary and stationary electric power generation. However, their high operating temperatures pose challenges to material selection, structural integrity, and performance consistency. Lowering the operating temperatures to intermediate ranges (~600-800Â°C) may resolve many of these issues and also allow use of metallic interconnects instead of ceramics. Hence, metallic interconnects are crucial components for SOFCs at such operation temperatures. Chromium containing alloys such as stainless steels are preferred as metallic interconnects due to their ability to form a protective oxide layer at the operating temperatures. Ferritic stainless steels are of particular interest for this purpose. However, chromium poisoning of the cathode due to formation of volatile chromium species at high temperatures is a challenge. Oxide dispersion is known to improve high temperature properties of metallic alloys. \r\nIn the present work, oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic stainless steel (AISI430) was explored as metallic interconnects. The ODS alloys were fabricated by two routes. First, a novel fabrication method, named reverse friction deposition (RFD), has been developed to process rod samples of AISI430 into tubular shaped ODS alloy interconnect. 8 wt% Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (8YSZ) powder was used as dispersoid. Second, spark plasma sintering (SPS) was employed to fabricate cylindrical ODS alloys of AISI430 by powder metallurgy route.\r\nIn the next phase of the work, oxidation behaviour of these alloy interconnects was studied at 800 Â°C for 100 h. The RFD alloy tubular product showed growth of Fe and Mn oxides on one side (top surface) and (Mn,Cr) spinels on the other side (inner surface) in accordance with the variation of oxide dispersoids. Further, interaction of both type of formed alloys was studied with the standard composite cathodic layer, 50 wt.% lanthanum strontium manganate (LSM) and 50 wt.% 8YSZ at 800 Â°C for 100 h to study the effect of volatile chromium species on the cathode degradation. High valence Cr+6 ion species block the triple phase boundaries or sites for electrochemical reduction of oxygen in the porous cathodes causing performance degradation in SOFCs. The cathodic layer was found to be structurally and chemically stable in the ODS metallic interconnects. Except trace amounts in some samples, no massive migration of Cr across the cathodic layer was observed in our experiments.','MME Office','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/vst-dukn-yko','','',1,'2024-04-22 04:25:33','Active'),(159,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','NeoHebbian Synapses for Accelerating Online Training of Neuromorphic Hardware ','Mr. Shubham R Pande (EE18D704)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. Anjan Chakravorthy\r\nCo-Guide: Dr. Bhaswar Chakrabarti\r\n\r\n','Electrical Engineering','2024/05/09 14:00','2024-05-09','yes','ESB 244','We propose and experimentally validate a neoHebbian artificial synapse based on ReRAM devices to enable the hardware implementation of a scalable online E-Prop learning algorithm. \r\nThis synapse features two state variables - a neuron coupling weight and an \"eligibility trace\" for updating the weight.

Both experimental and computational simulations are utilized to examine this process. The experimental model consists of a partially filled annular tank with a centrally located rotating shaft. By varying the rotational Reynolds number (Re), the researchers examine the resulting gas entrainment and characterize the different mechanisms involved. \r\n\r\nThe findings reveal that the fluid dynamics within the annular region can be categorized into four distinct regimes, each occurring as the Reynolds number increases. In the first regime, which occurs at low Re, there is no risk of gas entrainment. Moving into the second regime, mild gas entrainment occurs because of the shearing at the free surface between two opposing vortices. The third regime shows a significant reduction in gas entrainment due to the weakening of the flow mechanism observed in the second regime. Finally, the fourth regime exhibits vortex breakdown at the rotating shaft, leading to a substantial-scale gas entrainment.\r\n \r\nVarious mitigation techniques, such as baffle plates, hydrophobic/hydrophilic surfaces, and porous plates, were investigated.

Research has shown that providing external arm weight support increases the armâ€™s range of motion, and training with graduated weight support can help break abnormal movement patterns. Arm rehabilitation robots can be used for training with adaptive arm weight support, but they tend to be complex and bulky for use in small clinics or homes. On the other hand, simple and compact passive arm weight support devices do not measure arm movements to provide feedback and require manual adjustments of springs/rubber bands for deweighting the arm. To this end, we propose a simple, single-actuated degree-of-freedom robot â€“ MARS (Motorized Arm Support) that can provide adaptive arm deweighting and measure arm movements to provide gamified feedback for in-clinic and at-home use. This seminar presents the mechanical design of MARS, the algorithms for estimating human joint kinematics from the robotâ€™s data, and the characterization of its two control modes: a) Fixed Support and b) Arm Weight Support. A three-actuated degree-of-freedom mechatronic model of the human arm was utilized to characterize MARS.

However, this explosive growth in model size and the concomitant increase in required compute is unsustainable without significant semiconductor innovations across the hardware stack from materials and devices at the transistor level up through packaging. In this talk, materials advances needed to sustain continued CMOS scaling will be discussed including advanced transistor gate stacks, novel interconnect materials, and next-generation photoresists for high-NA photolithography. In addition, architectural progress in devices that harness the third dimension will be reviewed and will be shown to be critical to propel transistor density scaling.

These NVM elements act as artificial synapses and encode the weights of a neural network that execute analog compute operations in-memory, thereby enabling significant power performance benefits. It will also be shown that co-optimization of materials, algorithms and architecture is needed to unlock the promise of analog in-memory compute. Lastly, enhanced connectivity and scalability using a chiplet approach will be described to allow for seamless integration of disparate compute components.

Such low viscous lubricants are prone to boundary lubrication and require additives \r\nto improve their friction reduction and wear resistance performance. Conventionally used \r\nextreme pressure and anti-wear additives have good tribological properties at boundary \r\nlubrication regimes.

Fiber lasers have unique advantages compared to other types of laser systems including efficient electrical to optical conversion, excellent beam quality due to single transverse mode of operation and the option for power scaling through master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) schemes. Beyond kiloWatt power level, an attractive option for power scaling is beam combination of multiple fiber amplifiers. Various approaches to beam combining exist, such as spectral beam combining, coherent beam combining, and polarization beam combining. Among these, coherent beam combining (CBC) holds much promise for scaling to more than 100 beams. CBC can be achieved using either filled aperture or tiled aperture configurations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are primarily focused on exploring different coherent beam combination methods and optimization of those to achieve high efficiency and better beam quality. The phase locking between lasers for CBC has been implemented with Stochastic Parallel Gradient Descent (SPGD) algorithm with the help of on-loop phase modulators. In filled aperture-based CBC, diffractive optical element (DOE)-based combining is an attractive method due to its high beam quality and efficiency advantages. We have modeled and simulated different DOEs for various configurations and demonstrated a novel phase synchronization scheme based on minimizing higher diffraction orders in a 2 x 100 W CBC system. An alternate power scaling approach is polarization beam combining (PBC), in which nearly ideal efficiency (98%) has been demonstrated. High power CBC of a  4 x 300 W system also has been demonstrated using a DOE based filled aperture configuration.  We have also investigated the effect of different beam non-uniformities on CBC efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of scalability to achieve higher power levels, tiled aperture configuration (TAC) shows wide potential due to its simplistic design with fewer optical elements. Our efforts are focused on finding novel and reliable feedback points in the system for non-central feedback, to overcome the limitations of central lobe based feedback. We have simulated different non-central feedback point/area based phase locking methods considering the symmetry of far-field speckle patterns, and one-point based side area feedback phase locking has been experimentally validated in our 7-beam hexagonal TAC system. Additionally, we have investigated the effect of transverse phase aberrations and thermally induced pointing errors on our TAC 7 system. The potential of a dual-stage nested loop modular array configuration for further scaling while maintaining efficiency has also been explored through simulations.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/uuc-tsyr-rat','','',1,'2024-04-22 08:21:08','Active'),(171,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','A THEORETICAL STUDY ON THE CHANNEL CHARACTERISTICS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF AN UNDERWATER-TO-AIR OPTICAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM','Mr. BHOGESWARA RAO ANGARA','ROLL NO: OE17D302','GUIDE- PROF.

Also, it has become imperative to resolve conventional diesel enginesâ€™ pollutant emission and performance problems. The present research investigated the advanced diesel combustion mode of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) by retrofitting an agricultural diesel engine. The HCCI engine was effectively operated using seven biofuels: methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, diisopropyl ether, acetone, and ethyl acetate. The HCCI engine reduced carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and soot emissions by 17%, 58%, and 98%, simultaneously increasing indicated thermal efficiency by 30% maximum and 3% on average compared to the conventional diesel engine. The 3-D computational fluid dynamics simulations of HCCI combustion in the test engine were conducted to elucidate the experimental findings. The validated CFD tool was used to select the most suitable ignition improver, piston bowl shape, and compression ratio. The optimal fuel parameters for HCCI combustion control were obtained using machine learning and statistical tools. Further, a dynamic fuel blending system was developed and implemented to supply the desired fuel blends to the engine according to the load and speed demand. Overall, the research provided a sustainable, practical solution for commercializing clean-burning and high-thermal efficiency agricultural diesel engines.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/iir-qoit-gnz','','',1,'2024-04-22 12:28:22','Active'),(176,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Mpemba effect: An anomalous relaxation phenomenon','R.

Moreover, the treatment cost is one of the major factors that prevents treatment of many of these waste streams, leading to the pollution and unavailability of the water and land resources that can be utilized for production of useful commodities.  Therefore, for the sustenance of the environment and thriving of humanity, cost-effective treatment strategies are needed. Resource recovery is one of the perspectives whose adoption in our treatment philosophy can bring down the treatment cost and would augment the available resources for further utilization. In this paradigm, waste streams are not considered waste but as a repository of rich resources that can be profitably recovered. In our lab, we have been consistently working on integrating resource recovery strategies in developing the treatment processes. We are specifically working on perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) removal from aqueous streams using naturally-derived waste material as adsorbents, resource recovery from seawater desalination plant reverse osmosis concentrate, developing electrospun nanofiber air filters using food waste, phosphorus recovery from poultry litter waste and treatment of oil field wastewater (produced water).

However, controlling the chemo- and regioselectivity is an important consideration for the success of this type of annulation reaction due to the presence of two Ï€-components. Realizing the need for a viable synthetic transformation for selective functionalization, we have demonstrated transition-metal-catalyzed site-selective tandem annulation of 1,6-diynes with various substituted indolines, indoles, pyridones, and amides through consecutive dual C H bond activation for the synthesis of various polycyclic molecules in a highly regioselective manner.5 Further, we explored selective C-H functionalization of sulfoxonium ylide with 1,3 diynes to synthesize highly useful substituted 3-alkynelated-1-naphthol derivatives.6 In addition, we have also reported the synthesis of biologically important 3,4-dihydroisoquinolinone via Co(III)-catalyzed annulation of substituted N-Cl benzamides with various allylic coupling partners in a redox-neutral manner.7\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

Potential strategies like carbon capture, storage, and utilization have been explored to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic CO2. The current work focuses on the thermocatalytic conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals like methanol using metal-metal oxide catalysts, which can be upgraded further to hydrocarbons using metal oxide/zeolite catalysts. Cu/ZnO/ZrO2-based catalysts are widely explored for CO2 conversion to methanol due to their high activity and stability. However, experiments in the literature show high variability in the performance of the Cu/ZnO/ZrO2-based catalysts owing to differences in the catalyst structure. Additionally, a mechanistic understanding of the performance of such multifunctional catalysts is lacking due to ambiguity regarding the actual active sites. In this context, a thermodynamically consistent microkinetic model was developed by analyzing the complex reaction network and the associated energetics using density functional theory (DFT) simulations for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol on Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3. This study focuses on unraveling the role of interfaces on Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3  catalyst by detailed mechanistic investigations using the DFT framework. This study also involves evaluating the facet-dependent activity of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst on all the catalytically relevant surfaces of ZnOx/Cu(hkl) considering low indexed facets such as (111), (110), (100), (211) of Cu. \r\nThe second part of the work focuses on the influence of metal oxides on the proximity-dependent reactivity and hydrocarbon selectivity of tandem MeOx/HZSM-5 (MeOx â€“ ZnO, ZrO2, In2O3, Cr2O3, ZnZrOx) catalyst. Experimental evidence suggests ion exchange of BAS of HZSM-5 catalyst with cationic species from the MeOx. The metal vacancy formation energy on MeOx catalysts was investigated to help deduce the likelihood of ion exchange with BAS of HZSM-5. Experiments show the reactivity and hydrocarbon distribution in such cases varies for different MeOx/ZSM-5 catalysts. Mechanistic details of the modification of methanol conversion to gasoline range hydrocarbons due to the ion exchange will be investigated on the metal-modified/HZSM-5 catalyst to understand the reactivity and hydrocarbon distribution differences. \r\nOverall, this work offers a comprehensive exploration of CO2 utilization to hydrocarbons, employing first principles DFT simulations in understanding the mechanisms and reaction behavior. This work would help in developing strategies for catalyst design for CO2 conversion to value-added chemicals towards a sustainable low-carbon future.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/pdn-qkyz-hyq','seminar24-04-2024 04:35','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar24-04-2024 04:35',1,'2024-04-24 04:35:17','Active'),(190,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','â€œEXPLORING THE CONTENT DIVERSITY OF MARKETER-GENERATED FOOD POSTS ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND USER MOTIVATIONS IN ENGAGING WITH THEM.â€','Ms. CHRISTY MARIA TS, Roll no.

Marketing of unhealthy food, particularly through social media platforms, is recognized as a significant contributor to this issue. Food brands are heavily investing in social media platforms, generating a substantial volume of marketer-generated content (MGC) to enhance consumer engagement. Thus, understanding consumer engagement and its underlying motivations is paramount to comprehending consumer behaviour. However, limited research exists regarding the motivations driving consumer engagement with marketer-generated food content, particularly across social media platforms. Additionally, only sparse studies compare content types between healthy and unhealthy food brands and their impact on consumer engagement. This study is undertaken to fulfil two objectives: firstly, to examine the content diversity and engagement patterns of MGC between healthy and unhealthy food brands across social media platforms, and secondly, to explore consumer motivations in engaging with such content. The findings of this research will contribute to both theoretical knowledge and practical insights, enabling healthy food brands and policymakers to develop effective consumer engagement strategies aimed at promoting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','--web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadras/j.php?MTID=m66d5d55e9f91','','',1,'2024-04-24 04:41:06','Active'),(191,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Association in like-charged surfactant-nanoparticle systems: Interfacial and Bulk effects',' Manaswini (ch21s004)  ',' Manaswini (ch21s004)  ','Dr. Basavaraja Madivala Gurappa (Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Sumesh P Thampi (Co - Guide)','Department of Chemical Engineering','2024/04/24 14:00','2024-04-24','yes','Online','Surfactant-nanoparticle systems have been extensively studied both from a fundamental standpoint and due to their industrial relevance. While the interactions between charged nanoparticles and oppositely charged or non-ionic surfactants have been well understood, the association of similarly charged surfactants and nanoparticles in an aqueous solution still needs to be solved, and the understandings reported in the literature are conflicting. To address this issue, we undertake a fundamental study to investigate bulk and interfacial phenomena in binary mixtures of (i) positively charged nanoparticles and cationic surfactants, and (ii) negatively charged nanoparticles (of different sizes) and anionic surfactants. We find that the surfactant molecules adsorb on the surface of the nanoparticle despite similar charge leading to super-charging of particles and simultaneously driving more surfactant molecules to the interface, lowering the surface tension. This effect is more pronounced at low surfactant concentrations and is observed irrespective of size of nanoparticles and surfactant-particle combination. Further, we elucidate the important role of electrostatic interactions in the surfactant-particle complexation process by varying the pH of the dispersions. Contrary to changes in the properties of the dispersed species and interface, the presence of particles does not appreciably change the bulk property such as critical micellar concentration. Additionally, fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to gain insights into the nature of the dispersed species at surfactant concentrations higher than the CMC.','Chemical Engineering Office','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/fvp-rejc-wts','','',1,'2024-04-24 04:45:09','Active'),(192,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Food Sovereignty and the Changing Agrarian and Socio-Economic Life of Kondhs in Rayagada','MS.Abhinita Mohanty','Ph.D Research Scholar [HSD16D029]','Prof.Sudhir Chella Rajan, Guide','HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES','2024/04/25 16:00','2024-04-25','','Google meet [Online]https://meet.google.com/unw-scbb-xud.','This thesis uses a political ecology framework to examine the co-existence of swidden and capitalist agriculture among the Dongaria Kondhs in Rayagada District, Odisha, India.

The study explores the impact of capitalism and neoliberal markets on tribal food, ecosystems and the emergence of a novel expression of the global food sovereignty movement. The research reveals that the Dongaria Kondhs can navigate capitalism while preserving traditional practices, agroecology and food diversity. The study also analyses the relationships among different social classes, including Kondhs, Dalits, OBCs, and non-tribal classes, to interpret the complex interplay of class, caste, and tribe in the context of capitalist transitions. Ultimately, the research unveils the resilience and adaptation of tribal communities within the changing socio-economic and ecological landscape. It argues that a broader conception of what constitutes food sovereignty movements and necessary adaption to local realities are crucial to determine the long-term success of such forms of resistance. \r\n ','HSS OFFICE','hsoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/unw-scbb-xud.','','',1,'2024-04-24 05:18:07','Active'),(193,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Relative Freshness Stochastic Hybrid Systems Markov Chain (RF-SHS-MC) model for the study of Age of information','Mr. Y.

AoI can be analyzed by modeling status update systems as queuing systems. AoI is helpful in many applications like safety alarms, autonomous driving,  stock market, remote health monitoring, navigation Maps, aviation etc.,.  In status-update systems featuring parallel servers between the source and destination, the received packets at the destination may arrive out of sequence. Such situations complicate the analysis of AoI using conventional methods.  In the seminar, we propose a novel method of defining the discrete states of the stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) Markov Chain by using the relative freshness of packets in a queuing system that makes the analysis of the SHS easier compared to conventional methods.

SPH is a meshless Lagrangian method that has gained popularity for modelling free surface flows and fluid-structure interaction problems due to its ability to handle large deformations and complex geometries. Studying steep wave interaction with a floating body using WCSPH involves simulation of the complex fluid-body interactions with accuracy. In order to evaluate the accuracy and to improve the computational cost of SPH, variable mass particle distributions is employed. The SPH method is implemented using suitable numerical techniques, such as neighbour search algorithms, time integration schemes, and artificial viscosity formulations, to solve the discretized SPH equations efficiently. An appropriate boundary condition is defined to generate steep waves in the computational domain to represent its interaction with the floating body. The study of regular wave interaction with a floating body has also been done, to show that the variable mass particle distribution on the preselected free surface region models the wave evolution sufficiently well to compare with the experimental results and also to verify the accuracy and convergence of the numerical results.\r\n\r\n','Department of Ocean Engineering','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-24 10:03:01','Active'),(198,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Development of Formulation and Processes for Full Scale Inclusion of Nano-Aluminium in Industrial Grade Solid Rocket Propellants','Mr.Bedabrata Sanyal (AE14D414)','PhD Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering.','Prof. S R Chakravarthy - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/04/26 15:00','2024-04-26','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/yni-euod-oqk','','',1,'2024-04-25 04:27:28','Active'),(199,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Role of catestatin and its naturally-occurring variant Gly364Ser in regulating endothelial function','Kajal Rathod (BT22D006)','PhD scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Research supervisor: Prof. Nitish R Mahapatra','Department of Biotechnology','2024/04/29 15:30','2024-04-29','','BT Seminar Hall','The endothelium, which forms the inner lining of all the blood and lymphatic vessels, from the aorta to tiny capillaries, is the primary regulator of vascular homeostasis.

Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a widely used method to reduce the oxygen content of polyols. However, converting polyols into diols is challenging due to the formation of undesired by-products, especially with long-chain polyols. Selective diol formation requires specialized catalysts and precise reaction conditions. Cu-based metallic catalysts show promise in cleaving primary hydroxyl groups, while HDO on inverse metal oxide-on-metal catalysts like Pt-WOx and Ir-ReOx facilitates secondary C-O cleavage. In this context, our Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations predicted glycerol\'s C-O bond cleavage on BrÃ¸nsted acidic Pt-WOx catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere to proceed via a \"protonation dehydration\" mechanism. We showed that that the Pt-WOx interface ensures BrÃ¸nsted acid (BA) regeneration during HDO. Strong BA sites on Pt-WOx facilitate selective 1,3-PDO formation due to significant differences in primary and secondary C-O bond cleavage barriers. DFT simulations also predicted a similar kinetic preference for secondary C-O cleavage in erythritol, a longer chain molecule than glycerol, on Ir-ReOx and Pt-WOx catalysts, explaining the predominant formation of 1,2,4-butanetriol (1,2,4-BTO) and 1,4-BDO during erythritol HDO reaction.  Our simulations suggests that fine dispersion of WOx to trimeric units on Pt nanoparticles, preventing W doping and WOx and agglomeration to 3D WO3 on small Pt nanoparticles, are desirable for high BA strength. Such catalysts are expected to boost selective secondary C-O cleavage in polyols. Identifying thermodynamically stable WxOy clusters on the Pt surface and BA concentration on the WOx unit is crucial in catalyst design. However, the high computational costs of DFT restrict the exhaustive exploration space, limiting insights into the catalyst structure and hindering rational catalyst design. To overcome this, we developed and deploy a Machine-Learned-Force-Field (MLFF) driven approach to elucidate the complex structure of Pt-WOx catalyst.

These studies and the presence of naturally occurring genetic variants in the RP genes led us to ask if RP variants play a role in driving adaptation. In the current study, Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based population genetic model and CRISPR-generated isogenic strains were used to test this role of RP alleles. RP allele-specific strains and populations were phenotyped in different environments, and their relative fitness was compared. This study revealed the effect of RP alleles to differentially modulate phenotype in a genetic context and environment-dependent manner. To study the potential mechanism of phenotypic regulation, an analysis of cellular translation dynamics by SUnSET assay and polysome profiling was performed. The SUnSET assay showed that these RP alleles can differentially modulate efficiency in different environments. Currently, I am carrying our RNAseq in monosomal and polysomal fractions to identify the transcripts that are prefrentially translated by the RP alleles, leading to phenotypic plasticity. The identification of RP alleles as regulators of cellular phenotypic plasticity places them at a central position in driving adaptation.','BTOFFICE','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-25 11:01:26','Active'),(207,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Influence of powder surface chemistry on the optimum processing window of laser powder bed fusion additive manufactured AlSi10Mg alloy','Mr. Ranjith Kumar (ME19D016)','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide: Dr. Hariharan K (Associate professor-ME) / Co-Guide: Dr. Ravi Sankar Kottada (Professor-MME)\r\nDC Members: Dr. Sushanta Kumar Panigrahi- Chair Person (Professor-ME)\r\nDr. Ganesh Sundaram - (Professor-MME)\r\nDr. Narasimhan Swaminathan- (Professor-ME)\r\n\r\n','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/05/06 14:30','2024-05-06','yes','Through Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/qce-rpqg-mrk','AlSi10Mg alloy has gained considerable research interest in the laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing (LPBF-AM) community due to its better weldability.

Moreover, the treatment cost is one of the major factors that prevents treatment of many of these waste streams, leading to the pollution and unavailability of the water and land resources that can be utilized for production of useful commodities. Therefore, for the sustenance of the environment and thriving of humanity, cost-effective treatment strategies are needed. Resource recovery is one of the perspectives whose adoption in our treatment philosophy can bring down the treatment cost and would augment the available resources for further utilization. In this paradigm, waste streams are not considered waste but as a repository of rich resources that can be profitably recovered. In our lab, we have been consistently working on integrating resource recovery strategies in developing the treatment processes. We are specifically working on perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) removal from aqueous streams using naturally-derived waste material as adsorbents, resource recovery from seawater desalination plant reverse osmosis concentrate, developing electrospun nanofiber air filters using food waste, phosphorus recovery from poultry litter waste and treatment of oil field wastewater (produced water). We are observing that resource recovery strategies can offer a sustainable alternative to the existing treatment methods by providing economic benefits of waste treatment and also creating an alternative source of raw materials for manufacturing processes.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','EVENT HOST: Dr Himanshu Goyal, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Madras-web confernce link','seminar26-04-2024 03:40','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar26-04-2024 03:40',1,'2024-04-26 03:40:57','Active'),(210,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL',' Black Hole Microstates and Semi-holographic EFT for Strange Metallic Transport','Mr. HARERAM SWAIN, (PH19D042)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide: Dr. AYAN MUKHOPADHYAY','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/04/29 17:00','2024-04-29','yes','https://meet.google.com/yrj-xisw-hsh','AdS/CFT correspondence has given us key insights into how to relate complicated many-body physics at strong coupling to solvable single- or few-body classical problems in a curved geometry.

At the same time, the conventional method of transporting Hythane (like CNG, in compressed form used in high-pressure pipelines) has significant safety concerns primarily due to hydrogen embrittlement. The current study proposes to convert the gaseous components to gas hydrate pellets, thus keeping them enclosed inside hydrogen-bonded water cages. In this work, gas hydrate based Hythane storage and transportation has been studied with three different Hythane gas mixtures ranging in hydrogen concentrations from 8-30 % in methane. Further, to improve hydrate growth, the influence of specific chemical additives to promote the gas hydrate formation was investigated, including surfactants (kinetic hydrate promoters) and tetrahydrofuran (thermodynamic hydrate promoters). Separately, nanohybrids and biosurfactants were synthesized to reduce the foam generation during the use of surfactants. A thermodynamic study was performed for every system, followed by a hydrate growth kinetics study to understand mole consumption and induction time distributions for all the systems. Finally, hydrogen storage capacity in Hythane hydrate at a moderate pressure of 6 MPa and 274.15 K temperature has been reported. The highest hydrogen storage and faster kinetics of hydrate growth were observed with THF as an additive. Hythane gas hydrate pellets were made and stored at 1 MPa and 283.15 K for extended periods without any significant loss of hydrogen from the hydrate phase.

The difficulty in selective activation of the ortho-methyl C(sp3)âˆ’H bond over the ortho-aromatic C(sp2)âˆ’H bond arises due to the facile formation of a five-membered palladacycle as compared with a six membered one.1 The only strategy to address this issue is directing group assisted transition-metal catalyzed benzylic C(sp3)âˆ’H bond activation, where an exogenous group or native directing group orients the transition metal catalyst towards the particular Cï€­H bond in a highly selective manner.2 In this research proposal seminar, a comprehensive survey on various directing group assisted Pd-metal catalyzed benzylic C(sp3)âˆ’H functionalization will be discussed along with future prospects of the Pd-catalyzed  benzylic C(sp3)âˆ’H alkylation and annulation with alkenes via Cï€­H activation.\r\n \r\nReferences: 1.

The pivotal breakthrough in isolating stable NHCs facilitated their comprehensive characterization, including the quantification of their diverse chemical and structural attributes. The pronounced Ïƒ-donor capability of NHCs, coupled with the facile modification of their electronic and steric characteristics, has rendered them a preferred option across various domains of metal-based chemistry.1 The key applications of NHC ligands lies in the area of homogeneous catalysis although, recently found suitable for the construction of metal assisted three-dimensional assemblies. These assemblies find potential applications in host-guest/medicinal chemistry, while the specially designed hetero-/homobimetallic catalysts with their cooperative potential can be used for orthogonal tandem catalysis.2 Recent studies suggest that unsymmetrical bis(azolium) salts serve as excellent NHC precursors for the construction of above-mentioned assemblies as well as hetero/homo-bimetallic catalysts as they can provide the selectivity as well as rigid platform required for fixing the two metals effectively.3-5 Accordingly, we have synthesized various types of unsymmetrical bis(NHC) precursors based on (benz)imidazolylidene and 1,2,4-triazolylidene donors to employ them in the formation of coinage metal assisted self-assembled structures as well as hetero/homo-bimetallic complexes. Utilizing these unsymmetrical ligands, several hetero/homo-bimetallic complexes have been synthesized involving various metals (IrIII, PdII, AuI etc.) and some of these complexes have been studied as effective catalysts in various tandem catalytic transformations as well as challenging hydrodefluorination (HDF) reactions. Moreover, these ligands have also been instrumental in the synthesis of unique multinuclear MI-polycarbene complexes (M = AgI/CuI/AuI). A comprehensive discussion of these catalytic processes and multinuclear molecular self-assembly will be presented during the seminar.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.	a) Huynh, H. V. Chem.

Designing electrocatalysts for the reduction of these small molecules is of prime importance in the renewable energy domain. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a slow reaction at the cathode side that limits the performance of fuel cells and metal-air batteries for a variety of power applications. The Pt/C is the best electrocatalyst for ORR [1-4]. Manganese oxide phases (MnO, Mn2O3 and Mn3O4) are rich in redox chemistry, which have been explored as non-noble metal oxide electrocatalysts for ORR [5]. In addition, manganese oxide-based electrocatalysts are known to decompose H2O2 intermediate disproportionately to facilitate 4-electron ORR pathway [6]. We have investigated manganous oxide/activated charcoal nanocomposites as potential materials for ORR activity and established a volcanic trend with 18 wt% MnO as the best composite.  \r\nHaber-Bosch process is an established energy intensive industrial process for converting nitrogen to ammonia [7,8]. The Nâ‰¡N bond activation on metal surfaces has been studied using surface spectroscopy techniques to understand the mechanism of ammonia synthesis [9]. Electrocatalytic N2 reduction to NH3 under ambient conditions is emerging as an alternative to HB process [10-12]. However, the low conversion rate, poor Faradaic efficiency and concurrent HER process are some of the drawbacks identified [13]. Introducing Lewis acidic sites in the electrocatalyst can cause preferential adsorption of nitrogen over H+ enhancing the yield and Faradaic efficiency of NH3 formation [14]. In our work, bimetallic iron cobalt borate and 2D molybdenum boride (MBene) electrocatalysts are designed and tested for N2 reduction to NH3 under ambient conditions. These catalysts have produced NH3 in higher yields with good Faradaic efficiencies. These results will be presented in this colloquium.  \r\nReferences:\r\n(1)	P. Justin, P.H.K. Charan, G.

Li-ion batteries (LIBs) play a crucial role in energy storage, leading to a significant increase in their usage and, consequently, a rise in scrap generation1. Considering the environmental consequences and the high cost of lithium and heavy metals found in spent LIBs, it is essential to pursue a sustainable and effective recovery process. Recently, Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES), a type of biocompatible solvents has emerged as a category of biocompatible solvents, offering promise as effective lixiviants for leaching applications. DES are low-melting mixtures composed of a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) in a particular ratio2. Herein, we investigated the use of DES composed of choline chloride (ChCl) and Î±-Keto Carboxylic Acids as a potential alternative to the conventional mineral acids for the extraction of metals from spent LIB cathode materials3. Adding water as a co-solvent enhances the extraction efficiency by reducing the viscosity of the system and promoting mass transfer. The presence of water alters the molecular environment of DES through the establishment of hydrogen bonds with its constituent elements. Molecular Dynamics (MD) has been employed to investigate the molecular environment of aqueous DES systems with varying amounts of water. Additionally, investigations into the physicochemical characteristics of aqueous DES mixtures have been conducted to forecast structural modifications within the DES. This is accomplished by scrutinizing the volumetric and excess thermodynamic properties of the DES: H2O system. \r\nReferences:\r\n1. P. Meshram, R. V. Jaiswal, Abhilash, C. Baiju and R. L.

This work investigates the characteristics of IEMI at the receiver end under office environment conditions using off-the-shelf components. Existing 3-10GHz UWB channel model parameters are adapted for 0.5-2GHz IEMI transmission and verified experimentally.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the experimental observations, we effectively detect ultra wideband (UWB) IEMI using multiband spectrum sensing techniques. We devise a system-level IEMI receiver to facilitate this detection. The frequency band is segmented into eight sub-bands, and a software-defined radio ADRV9009 is employed to downconvert and digitize each sub-band. A comparative study of receiving and combining the eight sub-bands simultaneously and in a time-interleaved manner is presented.\r\n\r\nThe challenge of receiving a high power wide bandwidth signal is addressed by designing a highly linear receiver front-end IC in TSMC 65nm CMOS to process the wideband simultaneously. First, a single-ended 1-28dB tunable attenuator matched to antenna 50-Ohms impedance drives an active balun with minimal gain and phase mismatch across the wide bandwidth (BW). Second, the output of balun is filtered and downconverted separately in eight sub-bands with 200MHz bandwidth. Harmonic mixing and crosstalk are minimized during the simultaneous processing of eight sub-bands. The fabricated prototype operates on a 1.2V supply, consuming 264mW power to output the down-converted sub-bands from the specified frequency range. Subsequently, these down-converted sub-bands are digitized and processed off-chip to retrieve the IEMI signal accurately.\r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/cow-mwzy-qnu','','',1,'2024-04-26 09:44:47','Active'),(221,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','\"Evolution of Computational Chemistry - Understanding Concept to Expediting Commercialization\" ','Dr.Rajappan Vetrivel, PoornaPrajna Institute of Scientific Research,Bengaluru&Sravathi AI Technology Private Limited,Bengaluru ','Dr. Rajappan Vetrivel, an Honorary Professor at Poorna Prajna Institute of Science\r\nand Technology, Bangalore, is a distinguished Computational Chemist.

Its natural frequency of vibration is higher than the peak ocean wave frequency. Generally, the response of the jacket structure platform is significantly small in comparison to other floating offshore structures. But the small response is good enough to generate significant stress at the joint level of jacket members. This is due to the rigid connection between the members at the joint level. In literature also, itâ€™s well-studied that the joint of the jacket structure is vulnerable to stress developed and shows fatigue damage. Further, a reduction in the response of jacket structure using conventional design procedures may have a huge financial burden. So, dynamic response control of such a structure to reduce the effect of fatigue damage at the joint of members is the most economical and practical approach.\r\nA tuned liquid column damper (TLCD) is used as a passive control device to control the response of the jacket structure. The control in response is achieved by tuning the TLCD at the natural frequency of the Jacket structure. This gives control only at the natural frequency of the structure. This way, the total control achieved is not good enough. Further, TLCD is converted to semi-active TLCD by changing the pressure at the column.  The pressure in TLCD column is governed by the frequency change in the displacement response of jacket structure. So, liquid sloshing frequency should match with real time displacement frequency. Further, the robustness of Semi-active TLCD is also shown based on a change in the nature of excitation. \r\n','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-26 12:21:43','Active'),(226,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Topological Data Analysis, Basics, Computation and Applications','Prof. Siddharth Pritam','Siddharth Pritam is a faculty member in the computer science group at Chennai Mathematical Institute.

The present research investigated the advanced diesel combustion mode of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) by retrofitting an agricultural diesel engine. The HCCI engine was effectively operated using seven biofuels: methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, diisopropyl ether, acetone, and ethyl acetate. The HCCI engine reduced carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and soot emissions by 17%, 58%, and 98%, simultaneously increasing indicated thermal efficiency by 30% maximum and 3% on average compared to the conventional diesel engine. The 3-D computational fluid dynamics simulations of HCCI combustion in the test engine were conducted to elucidate the experimental findings. The validated CFD tool was used to select the most suitable ignition improver, piston bowl shape, and compression ratio. The optimal fuel parameters for HCCI combustion control were obtained using machine learning and statistical tools. Further, a dynamic fuel blending system was developed and implemented to supply the desired fuel blends to the engine according to the load and speed demand.

Dumping the pollutant directly into water sources is a major environmental concern because Cr(VI) is carcinogenic, highly toxic, and can enter the food chain. The permissible limit of chromium in drinking water is 0.05 mg/L, beyond which, if consumed, may cause cancer, organ damage, or other life-threatening problems. Several methods are available to treat chromium-contaminated wastewater, like adsorption, chemical precipitation, ion exchange separation, membrane filtration, electrocoagulation, and electrochemical processes. Among all techniques, the electrochemical remediation of Cr(VI) has received significant attention due to ease of operation, no chemical requirement, and no residual contamination.\r\n \r\nCarbon derived from biomass is among the promising materials for electrochemical reduction, which is explored in different forms in this study. Moreover, biomass derived carbon acts as a suitable adsorbent, trapping chromium from the water matrix. A low-cost but efficient composite generated from water hyacinth biomass is explored for its contribution to the electrochemical reduction of Cr(VI). The combination of water hyacinth carbon, catalysts, and additives showed increased reduction efficacy due to simultaneous adsorption and electrochemical reduction.

Among DP steels, DP 980 grade steel is gaining wide acceptance. However, DP steels fail easily during stamping operations due to their poor stretch flangeability. Stretch flangeability of a material is the resistance to through-thickness crack propagation during edge stretching. Hole expansion testing (HET) is successfully used to predict tendency for edge cracking. There are various heat treatment methods available to improve stretch flangeability. The current research uses localized heat treatment of specimen edges on DP980 steel sheets to increase formability which prevents edge cracking during forming operations like the stamping process. Therefore, in the current study, techniques have been developed to improve the stretch flangeability of DP 980 steel by locally modifying the microstructure at the hole edge using a microplasma heat source. Standard HET specimens 90 mm x 90 mm square with a 10 mm diameter central hole were prepared A microplasma torch with a controlled heat input was used to locally heat treat the edge of the hole. This ensures local softening around the circumference of the circle. The hole expansion test (as per standard ISO 16630) was carried out to identify the stretch flangeability of DP 980 steel.

This encompasses asymmetric cross-coupling reactions, enzyme-catalyzed kinetic resolutions, asymmetric cycloaddition reactions, asymmetric transfer hydrogenations, and asymmetric reduction reactions.3 Nevertheless, the practicality of these strategies has been hampered by the necessity of prefunctionalized substrates, poor competence and limited stereoselectivity. Consequently, the requirement of peculiar and streamlined asymmetric catalytic approach to access valuable axially chiral biaryls is highly coveted. In recent years, due to the atom-economical features, the atroposelective Câˆ’H functionalization has surfaced as an innovative and a robust strategy for the expeditious acquisition of axially chiral biaryl scaffolds.4 However, despite the remarkable progress made for atroposelective Câˆ’H functionalization, the extra synthetic steps required to install and cleave the directing group on the molecules. To avoid the extra synthetic steps, the concept of transient directing group (TDG) has been developed. Encouraged by this new synthetic tool, the scientific community showed a real endeavor toward the design and use of chiral transient directing groups to achieve the highly challenging atroposelective Câˆ’H bond functionalization reactions.5 In this seminar, the recent developments made in palladium-catalyzed atroposelective Câˆ’H bond functionalization reactions by using directing group and TDG strategy will be discussed.

They exhibit several advantages, such as being flexible, low-weight, low-cost, semi-transparent, and so on.1 However, till 2017, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs were only 10%, which is way behind the PCEs of silicon solar cells (30%).2 In the last five years, the PCEs of OSCs have improved from 10% to ~ 20%, mainly due to the replacement of traditional fullerene acceptors with non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).3 Among the NFAs, molecules like â€˜Y6â€™ with donor (D) and acceptor (A/AÊ¹) units arranged in a configuration of A-D-AÊ¹-D-A are being widely studied due to their enhanced photovoltaic performance.4 However, to commercialize Y6-based OSCs, further improving their PCEs is needed. In this seminar, first we will discuss the existing methods in the literature for improving PCEs, such as replacing the core moiety, end groups, chalcogen atoms, and alkyl chain length of the Y6 molecule.5â€“8 Next, we will introduce a few crucial experimental parameters governing the PCE, namely, the open circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, and fill factor.9,10 We will show how some of these factors can be computed using first-principle calculations for donor-acceptor complexes. In this context, we will discuss the results of our recent work, where we studied the effects of replacing various moieties of the Y6 molecule, namely, the pyrrole units with phospholes,11 the terminal F-atoms with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like Cl, CF3, and NO2, and substituting S with Se, and computed the PCEs for each case using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) simulations. In general, we find that the modified acceptors exhibit red-shifted absorption spectra and enhanced short circuit current density. However, the open circuit voltage of the modified acceptors (computed using the well-studied PM6 as the complementary donor) is lower than the unsubstituted Y6, leading to only a nominal increase in the PCEs. Since all the experimental parameters governing the PCE cannot be computed from first-principles, we computed charge transfer (CT) rates between the donor and acceptor complexes, which can be measured experimentally. To compute the CT rates from first-principles, we employed both Marcus theory12 and real-time time-dependent density functional tight binding theory (RT-TD-DFTB),13 where the latter is a semi-empirical alternative to RT-TD-DFT, and it can be used to simulate the CT rates of mesoscale systems. Using Marcus theory, we were able to reproduce the results outlined in Ref 14.14 We are in the process of assessing the RT-TD-DFTB predicted rates with the experimental results. After establishing the validity of these methods, we would like to explore several donor-acceptor complexes.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n(1)	Colsmann, A.; RÃ¶hm, H.; Sprau, C.

Depending on the number of crossings, they are subdivided into 31, 41, 52, 61, etc. Albeit populating ~1% of known PDB structure1, their role in protein is still a riddle to solve. However, some initial studies propose that knots may provide protein with enhanced mechanical stability against cellular degradation2, while another proposes that it depends on the direction of degradation3. In the proposed research, we look deeply into the degradation of various knotted protein substrates by ATP-dependent proteases ClpXP and ClpAP. In our study, we found that the degradation of 41 knotted miRFP proceeds smoothly with ClpXP, while ClpAP fails to degrade it. Such behavior can arise due to knot jamming in the translocation chamber of the ClpAP protease chamber. Employing a single-molecule optical tweezers-based assay, we propose to look deeply into the mechanism of degradation by these ATP-dependent proteases, as it is impossible to do so from bulk degradation assays.\r\nIn addition, the folding mechanisms of knotted proteins are ambiguous. The fate of a knot in a folded protein remains unclear when folded domains hinder the free termini. Initial investigations show that folded proteins can form knots despite bulky folded proteins at their termini4. Although these studies provide the idea of the simplest 31-knotted protein folding, the folding of complex higher-order knots remains elusive. In the proposed research, we will explore the possibility of knot formation in such chimeric protein constructs employing single molecule force spectroscopy by AFM to detect the knots.\r\nReferences:\r\n1) FaÃ­sca, P.

Dumping the pollutant directly into water sources is a major environmental concern because Cr(VI) is carcinogenic, highly toxic, and can enter the food chain. The permissible limit of chromium in drinking water is 0.05 mg/L, beyond which, if consumed, may cause cancer, organ damage, or other life-threatening problems. Several methods are available to treat chromium-contaminated wastewater, like adsorption, chemical precipitation, ion exchange separation, membrane filtration, electrocoagulation, and electrochemical processes. Among all techniques, the electrochemical remediation of Cr(VI) has received significant attention due to ease of operation, no chemical requirement, and no residual contamination.\r\n \r\nCarbon derived from biomass is among the promising materials for electrochemical reduction, which is explored in different forms in this study. Moreover, biomass derived carbon acts as a suitable adsorbent, trapping chromium from the water matrix. A low-cost but efficient composite generated from water hyacinth biomass is explored for its contribution to the electrochemical reduction of Cr(VI). The combination of water hyacinth carbon, catalysts, and additives showed increased reduction efficacy due to simultaneous adsorption and electrochemical reduction. This work offers a facile method for complete Cr(VI) removal and proposes a reduction mechanism that helps in cell design for large-scale applications.\r\n ','Chemical Engineering Office','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkLink https://meet.google.com/fqb-zzus-rsv','','',1,'2024-04-29 05:26:04','Active'),(237,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\" Time series models with additive noise with finite- and infinite- variance distributions - statistical and AI based approaches â€œ','Mr. Sayantan Banerjee, MA19D201','Research Scholar, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','DC Members: Dr. M.

However, many factors heavily impact Wi-Fi performance, such as WLAN standards, radio capabilities, bandwidth, operating band, channel quality, interference, noise, rate adaptation, hardware, infrastructure, client type, and others. Therefore, it is crucial to understand Wi-Fi performance for effective planning and management of Wi-Fi deployment. Our work aims to study Wi-Fi performance under various scenarios through in-site measurements and develop a recommendation mechanism for real-time deployment that guarantees the desired quality of service. Our primary focus is on passive in-site experiments and measurements in Indian homes to evaluate Wi-Fi parameters at low-layer levels and comprehend their impact on performance in terms of coverage, throughput, speed, and channel utilization. This work creates a new dataset for WLAN network performance recorded from more than 15 Indian homes, performing thousands of experiments with various traffic protocols and application bandwidths in a clean and static environment. The dataset allows us to understand the performance of Wi-Fi at various layers and its effect on overall performance. The dataset also enables us to predict real-time expected throughput, retries, and coverage at Indian homes.

Several types of polymer-modified clays have been developed, and the present study focuses on the use of superabsorbent polymer to modify bentonite clay by in-situ polymerization. To address the problem of polymer elution, the response surface method was employed to formulate a new optimized polymer composition for developing polymerized bentonites. The hydraulic performance of the developed polymerized bentonite was assessed by using a newly designed constant flow permeameter. Hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted using various inundating pore fluids mimicking the field scenario. A low-cost Arduino based data acquisition system was developed to log the data during the permeation experiment. Further, the durability of polymerized bentonites under cyclic wet-dry cycles was also investigated.

Ships with limited maneuverability must find safe routes that are free from collisions well ahead of time while operating between confined waters and the open sea. In tandem with this, the development of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) for large vessels to conduct commercial activities is also gaining momentum. In this article, we bring out a methodology for operating a MASS of an oil tanker class type KVLCC2 vessel by introducing a Collision Avoidance Module (CAM) in an autopilot design. The CAM is based on a cooperative Velocity and Heading Set approach in a dynamic marine environment. It is developed to perform in compliance with the COLREGs formulated by IMO for the prevention of collision at sea. It delivers the required course and speed to be maintained considering the maneuvering characteristics of the vessel for a collision-free path. The proposed method is validated by simulating it in several conventional colliding scenarios, including head-on, crossing, over-taking and close-quarter conditions for a single target ship as well as multiple target ship encounter situations. It is observed that the vessel can circumvent the target ships and converge back to its path in a closed-loop autonomous mode of operation.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-30 02:51:57','Active'),(247,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','A novel snubber circuit and Active gate driving  technique for SiC MOSFET','Mr. Vamshi Krishna Miryala (EE14D010) ','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr.Kamalesh Hatua ','Electrical Engineering','2024/05/15 14:00','2024-05-15','yes','Online','SiC MOSFETs have emerged as the latest technology switching devices replacing Si-IGBTs in 600V to 1.7kV voltage range.

The current work proposes a simple passive snubber that enables SiC MOSFETs to switch at its full speed.

The critical drawback of these exoskeleton designs is the human-exoskeleton interaction forces due to misalignment. This is primarily due to the limited degrees of freedom model assumed for the human shoulder. The glenohumeral joint in the conventional upper limb model is considered as a spherical joint, which, when considering the human anatomy, neglects the humeral head translation from the glenoid fossa of the scapula. This translation varies in each individual and depends on the type of shoulder disability. If this major internal motion is not considered in the design, the wearable exoskeletons can cause damage to the joint ligaments and tendons due to misalignment.

The critical drawback of these exoskeleton designs is the human-exoskeleton interaction forces due to misalignment. This is primarily due to the limited degrees of freedom model assumed for the human shoulder. The glenohumeral joint in the conventional upper limb model is considered as a spherical joint, which, when considering the human anatomy, neglects the humeral head translation from the glenoid fossa of the scapula. This translation varies in each individual and depends on the type of shoulder disability. If this major internal motion is not considered in the design, the wearable exoskeletons can cause damage to the joint ligaments and tendons due to misalignment.

This flexibility in system design can be utilized to incorporate several custom features. Security is one such feature that plays a crucial role in the modern era of connected devices. Ever since the era of the Internet began, the number of security breaches across computers worldwide has increased enormously. Deploying countermeasures for security threats in the hardware promises to be more efficient than the software-only counterparts. This thesis begins with a survey of the security features incorporated in hardware over the last five decades. We observe that two categories of security vulnerabilities have gained recurring attention over the years. They are, what we term as Memory vulnerabilities and Micro-architecture based vulnerabilities. Around 47% of the total works surveyed deal with Memory vulnerabilities, while around 25% of them deal with Micro-architecture based vulnerabilities. Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), a forum that ranks security threats, ranks Memory Vulnerability and Micro-Architecture based vulnerabilities among the top ten software and hardware weaknesses respectively. In this thesis, we present countermeasures for attacks from each of the two categories. We propose a framework to analyze micro-architecture based vulnerabilities over branch predictors and establish a tuneable scheme of defense to satisfy the orthogonal constraints of security and performance. In the later part of the thesis, we present solutions that thwart memory vulnerabilities that arise out of unsafe coding practices in languages such as C and C++. Our comprehensive solution for memory vulnerabilities exhibits very low performance and area overheads. All our solutions are implemented on open-source processors and verified on FPGA platforms.','CS Office','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/sij-jpdv-rex','','',1,'2024-04-30 11:28:04','Active'),(253,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','\"Computational Advancement towards Efficient Catalytic Materials: Connecting a Few Dots\"','Dr. Sudip Chakraborty, Reader F, Materials Theory for Energy Scavenging (MATES) Lab, Harish-Chandra Research Institute (HRI) Allahabad, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), India','Dr. Sudip Chakraborty is leading Materials Theory for Energy Scavenging (MATES Lab)\r\ngroup(http://www.hri.res.in/~sudipchakraborty/) in Indiaâ€™s premier theoretical research Institute Harish-\r\nChandra Research Institute (HRI) Allahabad (Prayagraj), Department of Atomic Energy, Govt. of India.\r\nAfter completing his Ph.D. in collaboration between Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and\r\nUniversity of Pune, India, he moved to Max Planck Institute, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany in March, 2011 as a Max\r\nPlanck Postdoctoral Fellow.

Bacteria form swarm and biofilm colonies on hydrated surfaces. These processes are significantly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, pH, nutrient availability, substratum properties, and the physiological state of the bacteria. \r\nIn this study, we develop a comprehensive two-phase model to analyze the dynamics of bacterial swarming on porous substrates. The two distinct phases under consideration are the cell and aqueous phases. We use the thin-film approximation, as the characteristic height of the swarm is significantly lower than its characteristic radius. Our model incorporates surfactant generation by microorganisms, drag forces between the cell and aqueous phases, osmotic influx, and Marangoni stresses. The disjoining pressure is included to account for substrate wettability, and a precursor film is employed to address the contact line singularity. Several morphologies of bacterial swarms, such as arrested, circular, modulated, branching, droplet, fingering, and dendrite, have been observed experimentally. The model developed is capable of predicting all these shapes. An increase in the wettability of the substrate leads to faster expansion, while increased surface tension helps redistribute biomass radially. The role of biomass growth and surfactant production rate, surfactant diffusivity, and osmotic influx on the morphology of bacterial swarm colonies are explored. \r\nAdditionally, we investigate the growth kinetics of bacterial biofilms on porous substrates. A three-phase model is developed, which accounts explicitly for the cell phase, extracellular matrix (ECM), and nutrient-rich aqueous phase. Here, again, we use the thin-film approximation. We use the 2D axisymmetric model to capture biofilm growth on a porous agar substrate. Our model accounts for osmotic flux and predicts the spatiotemporal variations of the volume fractions of the different phases and the nutrient concentrations in the biofilm and the substrate. An increase in surface tension helps redistribute biomass radially. Our model captures the behavior of different kinds of biofilms: films characterized by low (yeast) and high (bacterial) ECM content. The predictions of our model are quantitatively validated with the experimental data from the literature. Our model provides insights into the role of different parameters on biofilm growth, which can be used to develop strategies to prevent or accelerate biofilm formation on surfaces.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/zjv-hooi-ztaâ€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬','seminar01-05-2024 03:19','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar01-05-2024 03:19',1,'2024-05-01 03:19:57','Active'),(255,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Efficient Representation, Coding and Streaming of Light field Videos for Glasses-free 3D Displays ','Ms. Joshitha R (EE19D701)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Mansi Sharma\r\nCo-Guide: Dr. Kaushik Mitra ','Electrical Engineering','2024/05/07 10:00','2024-05-07','yes','ESB 244/Online','Applications of light fields for autostereoscopic or glasses-free displays have gained interest in the research community off-late since computational multi-view light field displays can enhance the viewing experience by providing a more immersive and realistic view. A richer 3D representation of a moving environment can be obtained from a dynamic light field or light field videos. However, unlike conventional videos, working with dynamic light fields necessitates additional storage and transmission requirements, and entails longer processing times. This results in higher data rates across all devices and services utilized for light field exchange and display. Thus, efficient representation and coding of light field videos capitalizing on the inherent redundancies in the spatial, angular, and temporal domains is necessary for streaming and display applications.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I shall discuss data-driven algorithms that efficiently represent and encode dynamic light field data. An integrated deep learning network that synchronously applies aperture coding and pixel-wise exposure coding on light field video to produce a single acquired image within a single exposure time, will be presented. The underlying spatial, angular, and temporal correlations are effectively exploited by a data-driven dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) based approach on these learnt acquired images arranged as time snapshots. In addition, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) removes intra-frame, inter-frame, and other intrinsic redundancies while maintaining reconstruction quality across various quantization parameters. Thus, the proposed scheme treats dynamic light fields as mathematical dynamical systems and  leverages on dynamic modes of acquired images obtained via coded-aperture patterns. I will also present a comparison of the scheme with other data-driven methods (involving (a) block singular value decomposition in a Krylov subspace and (b) Tucker decomposition with tensor sketching) to encode light fields.\r\n\r\nOverall, the algorithms exploit intra-view, inter-view, and other redundancies among light field views in spatial, angular and temporal directions to allow scalable light field video coding. The schemes provide flexible encoding of the input dynamic light field to satisfy diverse data rates for various approximation ranks and quantization parameters. Compression rates can be tailored to meet specific storage needs or bandwidths without compromising the quality of reconstructed light field video. The proposed scheme can be incorporated as a complement to other existing or future light field coding or video processing methods. The coding approaches are also applicable for light field streaming applications in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), or 3D platforms.

Therefore, restoring the structural integrity of the components is critically imperative. Repairing the damaged component is the most feasible solution compared to replacement when the damage is not extensive. This work presents a detailed investigation of patch repair on Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) laminate composites and enhancement in impact strength of post-repaired laminates by utilizing various stacking sequences of patch and parent laminates. Additionally, this study also provides a comprehensive investigation of the damage behaviour of laminate under impact loading with the aid of the Acoustic Emission (AE) technique. Four different combinations of patch-repaired laminates were considered, with two distinct configurations of patch and parent laminates each, and subjected to quasi-static indentation loading. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the repair method, with all repaired laminates showcasing superior impact resistance compared to their pristine counterparts. Patch laminates consisting of both 45Â° and 0Â° plies were observed to withstand a higher impact load, whereas patches with all plies at 45Â° exhibited the most gradual decrease in load over time. Moreover, a parametric study was also performed to determine the optimum size of the patch by utilizing the finite element numerical technique in ABAQUS software.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline Meeting Link : https://meet.google.com/pme-vick-kvj','','',1,'2024-05-01 11:03:40','Active'),(258,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Diffusion and search in complex media - examples from biology','Mithun Kumar Mitra','Department of Physics','IIT Bombay','Center for Soft and Biological Matter (CSBM)','2024/05/14 15:00','2024-05-14','','HSB 209, IITMadras','Transport and search processes are often crucial in biological systems.

This plasticity helps the organisms adapt to various conditions, allowing them to thrive and reproduce. Over time, individuals with advantageous traits are favoured by natural selection, leading to the development of more robust phenotypes. Knowing how genetics and physiology drive adaptation in different environments is crucial. \r\nAnalysis of yeast ribosomal protein (RP) sequences shows that despite being highly conserved, they have non-synonymous variants in multiple genes and strains, indicating that these variants may play a role in adaptation. Previous results from our laboratory found that the variants of the RP gene, RPL8A, can modulate phenotypic plasticity in a genetic and environment-specific manner. These results lead us to hypothesise that these variants in their genetic context could confer a fitness advantage in their adapted environment. Therefore, to explore the adaptive potential of RP variants, I will select two non-synonymous variants of RPL8A and create two pairs of strains such that the variant is either in a native or an alternative genetic background. These pairs of isogenic strains with alternative alleles will be evolved in single constant and alternating environments, such as rich growth conditions followed by stress conditions (genotoxic stress and antifungal drugs) and back to rich conditions and so on. The constant environment will allow us to understand the consequence of adaptation between the two strains in a pair. The fluctuating environment will reveal how dynamically changing environments can change the rate of evolution and adaptation when the variant is in a native or alternative background. Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of the evolved strains will reveal the molecular mechanisms behind the variant-specific adaptation in particular environmental conditions. Studying the impact of RP variation can contribute to understanding how RP genes can play a crucial role in adaptation to different environmental conditions, including drug resistance. \r\n\r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-02 03:36:31','Active'),(260,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Structural and functional characterisation of apelin receptor system','M.

Apelin receptor (APJR) is a class-A GPCR that regulates a wide range of intracellular signalling cascades. In response to its endogenous peptide ligands, apelin and elabela, APJR modulates blood pressure, cardiac output, and fluid homeostasis. The apelin ligand system itself exhibits versatility, with isoforms like apelin-13, -17, and -36 potentially eliciting distinct cellular responses. In class-A GPCRs, conserved motifs mediate conformational changes of the active states of the receptor, and signal transduction is achieved by selectively binding to GÎ± proteins and/or adapter protein, arrestin. However, a significant knowledge gap persists regarding how these conserved motifs within APJR govern receptor activation and dictate signaling specificity.  Investigating the role of these conserved motifs in APJR can provide us with a better understanding of the structural basis of receptor activation and G-protein coupling to transduce signals into the cells. Furthermore, while the presence of APJR and its ligands (apelin and elabela) is well-established across various vertebrates, a comprehensive understanding of how their structures and binding interactions diverge across species remains elusive. Addressing this knowledge gap would not only enhance our understanding of APJR signaling but also provide valuable insights into potential species-specific functionalities.\r\nThe functional roles of the DRY and NPxxY motifs within APJR were explored by analyzing their effects on downstream signaling pathways across the receptor\'s conformational landscape. Our findings demonstrate that mutations within these motifs lock the receptor in distinct conformations. Specifically, altering the DRY motif disrupts G-protein coupling, while mutations in the NPxxY motif abolish Î²-arrestin-2 recruitment. These observations illuminate the critical roles of these motifs in APJR activation and their potential for achieving functional selectivity. We propose that DRY and NPxxY motifs function as conformational switches, dictating APJR signaling outcomes. Additionally, the evolutionary relationship between apelin peptides and their binding mode to APJR was also explored. We focused on potential variations in ligand binding across different species, comparing lower organisms to humans.\r\n\r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-02 03:49:35','Active'),(261,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Studies of the dynamics of some soft matter systems using optical tweezers','Mr. AMRENDRA KUMAR, (PH18D055)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide: Dr. Basudev Roy','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/05/06 15:00','2024-05-06','yes','https://meet.google.com/xdo-kvrf-nci','Optical tweezers are versatile tools that use a highly tightly focused laser beam to trap, hold, and manipulate small particles without physical contact.

These flows are typically modeled as partial differential equations (PDEs), which are solved numerically using PDE solvers. In general, these simulations are extremely computationally expensive and are performed on massively parallel supercomputers. However, at extreme scales, the scalability of a PDE solver is significantly affected by the communication overhead. This work proposes an asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin (ADG) method that relaxes communication at a mathematical level and has the potential to provide high-order accurate solutions for various flow problems on both structured and unstructured meshes. We first propose a new approach to couple asynchrony-tolerant schemes with low-storage explicit RK schemes with reduced communication efforts. We evaluate the accuracy of this method both theoretically and numerically and demonstrate its scalability through simulations of decaying turbulence. Subsequently, we introduce the asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin (ADG) method, which combines the benefits of the DG method with asynchronous computing. We investigate the numerical properties of the proposed method, including local conservation, stability, and accuracy, and show that it is at most first-order accurate. To recover accuracy, we develop new asynchrony-tolerant (AT) fluxes that utilize data from multiple time levels. Several numerical experiments are conducted based on linear and nonlinear problems to validate these theoretical findings. Finally, a parallel PDE solver based on the ADG method is developed within an open-source finite element library deal.II, using a communication-avoiding algorithm. The accuracy of the solver is validated for compressible Euler equations, and scalability benchmarks demonstrate a speedup of up to 80% with the ADG method at an extreme scale with 9216 cores.','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-02 05:07:54','Active'),(263,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','A coupled fluid-flow and geomechanics modelling to access the advantage of CO2 as the working fluid and impact of fracture aperture alteration on energy production of EGS','Mr. Shradharghya Shankar Adhikary (AM20S023) ','Guide: Dr. M Manivannan','M S research scholar, Dept. of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras','Department of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering','2024/05/07 15:00','2024-05-07','yes','Online Meeting Link: https://meet.google.com/ziy-dkza-vsa','Geothermal reservoirs are often fractured rock medium.

In this seminar, the advancements of XAT strategies toward carbon-centered radicals will be discussed.2,3 Subsequently, a research proposal will be presented for future work.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1)	(a) JuliÃ¡, F.; Constantin, T.; Leonori, D.

However, the inherent challenges associated with bio-oil, such as high oxygen content, acidity, and low stability, have encouraged the need for effective upgradation processes. This study explores a novel approach by combining In-situ Fluidized Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and Ex-situ Ruthenium Titanium Oxide (RuTiO2) catalysts to enhance the properties of bio-oil. The In-situ FCC catalysts within a fluidized bed reactor facilitate the cracking of complex organic compounds, while the Ex-situ RuTiO2 catalyst further promotes deoxygenation and C-C coupling. The synergistic effects of these two approaches aim to reduce oxygen content, increase energy density, and improve the overall quality of bio-oil. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, it investigated the impact of this dual catalyst strategy on bio-oil feedstocks. The results demonstrate significant improvements in bio-oil properties such as oxygen percentage reduced to 9-10% from 35%, and carbon percentage increased to 78-80% from 55-56%, making it a more viable option for use as a transportation fuel. Experimental activities provide insights into the integration of FCC particles(In-situ) and RuTiO2 pellets (Ex-situ), shedding light on their combined potential for sustainable and environmentally responsible energy production from biomass resources.','Chemical Engineering Office','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/sjv-pqcw-waw','','',1,'2024-05-02 06:58:07','Active'),(267,'seminar','Seminar Cancellation','NULL','A coupled fluid-flow and geomechanics modelling to access the advantage of CO2 as the working fluid and impact of fracture aperture alteration on energy production of EGS','Mr. Shradharghya Shankar Adhikary (AM20S023)','Dr. Abhijit Chaudhuri ',' M S research scholar, Dept of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras','Department of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering','2024/05/07 15:00','2024-05-07','yes','Online Meeting Link: https://meet.google.com/ziy-dkza-vsa','Geothermal reservoirs are often fractured rock medium.

However, the conventional mode of refrigerated preservation of DNA has detrimental effects to its stability and remain a cost ineffective way of preservation. Ionic liquids (ILs), comprised of organic cations and organic/inorganic anions are promising solvent media for preservation of biomolecules. In this work, we attempt to understand the role of different classes of ILs: aprotic and protic in stabilizing DNA through a series of biophysical experiments. Our experimental findings suggested that protic ILs significantly elevate the DNA melting temperature, while the native B-conformation of DNA remains unaltered in all ILs. Further, we employed MD simulations and quantum calculations to understand the mechanism of interaction of ILs with DNA which revealed that protic ILs bring about a stronger H-bonding network through its ability of making multiple intermolecular H-bonds with the nucleobases and among the IL ions. Subsequently, we evaluated the structural integrity of plasmid DNA (pDNA) in the presence of ILs, while subjecting it to diverse stress conditions to ascertain its enhanced stability. Furthermore, we conducted bacterial transformation and transfection studies using pDNA in ILs to assess the functional activity. The results indicated that ILs confer protection to pDNA in ILs.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttp://meet.google.com/num-ebta-hvk','','',1,'2024-05-02 09:11:07','Active'),(272,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Development of Formulation and Processes for Full Scale Inclusion of Nano-Aluminium in Industrial Grade Solid Rocket Propellants','Mr.Bedabrata Sanyal (AE14D414)','Phd Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engg.','Prof.Chakravarthy S R - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/05/03 15:00','2024-05-03','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/scm-pzzy-nza','','',1,'2024-05-02 10:50:11','Active'),(273,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','â€œDesign and Synthesis of Aggregation Induced Emissive Gels and Application towards Fluorescence Sensing of Volatile Acids and Biologically Important Ionsâ€   ','Mr. Srikanta Kumar Patra (CY15D095)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Edamana Prasad, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/05/08 11:00','2024-05-08','yes','CB-310','There is an increasing interest in developing analytical methods for the detection of environmentally and biologically important chemical species as they have vital roles in many physiological and biochemical processes in both plants and animals, regulating their growth, developments and vital metabolic activities. However, they become toxic at high concentrations and their deficiency also creates health problem in living species. Compared to methods like inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), electrochemical methods and atomic spectroscopy, colorimetric and fluorometric methods have attracted wide attention because of their high selectivity, high responsiveness, low detection limits and onsite monitoring. Low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs) upon aggregation can result in enhanced fluorescence signals, which is termed as aggregation induced emission (AIE) and this phenomenon can be used to design fluorescent self-assembled systems such as gels for the detection of biologically important analytes.\r\nIn the present study, poly(aryl ether) dendron based molecular systems were designed and synthesized which contain different fluorophore core units (acridine, indole and tetraphenyl ethylene), through an aldimine coupling reaction.  The poly(aryl ether) dendron derivatives self-assemble and form gels, exhibiting AIE behavior, and they have been used for sensing Fe3+, Al3+, Cu2+, iodide and volatile organic acids for real-time monitoring.1-4 The gelator molecules were characterized using NMR, HRMS, XRD, HR-SEM and rheology techniques. Typically, the gel formation was carried out in DMF/water mixture (1:1, v/v) and the AIE property of gels were investigated using steady-state absorption and emission spectroscopic techniques. The sensory response of the gelator was tested with a wide range of acids, amines, cations and anions, both in solution as well as solid films. The results indicated that the acridine cored poly(aryl ether) dendron (APD) exhibited selective response towards acid vapours through fluorescence quenching and the detection limits (DL) of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and nitric acid (HNO3) vapors were found to be as low as 0.22, 0.90 and 0.30 ppm, respectively. Interestingly, the indole cored poly(aryl ether) dendron (IPD) and tetraphenyl ethynyl cored poly(aryl ether) dendron (TPD) exhibited â€œdual-detectionâ€ towards cations and anions (Fe3+ ion and I- for IPD and Cu2+, Al3+, F- and Cl- for TPD) through fluorescence â€œturn-onâ€ sensing.

However, due to some of its short-comings and the need to meet specific requirements, it has been derivatized extensively throughout the literature. Its derivatives are highly tunable and small changes in their substituents or Ï€-conjugation can drastically change the optical properties. It has been shown that triple bonds protect anthracene greatly against photo-oxidation and impart incredible stability. [1] Among such derivatives, 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA) is a very well-known industrial dye. BPEA and its derivatives have been widely studied and have been functionally employed in various fields such as photovoltaics, organic light-emitting diodes, fluorescent sensors, optical waveguides as well as in bio-applications. [2,3,4] Nevertheless, their monosubstituted analogues are an overlooked class of molecules. Hence, the primary focus of this work is to understand the photophysics of these basic building blocks by studying a class of similar molecules with different donor and acceptor substituents. It was found that these push-pull molecules exhibit significant charge transfer characteristics with wide emission window and excellent fluorescence quantum yields. [5] Various experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that their excited state structures and characteristics are strongly influenced by the specific donor or acceptor substituent, which gives them a high degree of tunability. Their uses in white light emission and moisture sensing; along with their remarkable emission responses towards environment polarity, temperature and viscosity make them an attractive class of molecules. The detailed investigations, including the experimental details and results, will be discussed during the seminar.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.	W. Fudickar et. al., J. Am. Chem.

This research aims to chemically modify few biopolymers and one commonly used functional polymer (PVA) using solvent-free methods, including vapor-phase and solid-state techniques. The first study involved the carboxymethylation of chitosan through solvent-free mixing with monochloroacetic acid and heating, leading to extensive crosslinking via electrostatic interactions between carboxylic acid and amine groups.[2] The resulting crosslinked carboxymethyl chitosan shows promise for applications in dye adsorption from acidic media and as a recoverable organocatalyst for organic reactions requiring acid stability. In the second study, PVOH was modified through heating with dichloroacetic acid without any additional reagents, resulting in the formation of an organo-soluble poly(vinyl alcohol-co-vinyl dichloroacetate) copolymer.[3] This water-insoluble copolymer was self-extinguishing, did not melt-drip or glow upon combustion, and could coat dummy currency notes to impart flame-retardant properties, highlighting its potential for flame-retardant applications. In the third study, nucleophilic biopolymers such as alkaline lignin and chitosan were modified by exposure to organohalide vapors, specifically allyl bromide and epichlorohydrin, without any catalysts or pretreatments. Fuming with epichlorohydrin introduced 1,3-glyceryl bridges and significantly crosslinked the biopolymers, while allyl bromide vapors facilitated O- or N-allylation. These modifications render the biopolymers suitable as versatile materials for further reactions or stabilize the various physical forms. Lastly, hydroxyl-rich polymers, including cellulose and chitin as well as agricultural residues like sawdust, coconut fibers, and rice husks, were successfully carbonized at low temperatures using novel carbonizing agents. The resulting carbonaceous materials showcase immense environmental remediation potential, and the developed solid-state, low-temperature methodology also presents a novel route to synthesize fluorescent carbon nanoparticles.\r\n[1] J.

There is a significant difference in mass and weight distribution of an EV and ICE vehicle resulting in distinct dynamic response. The vehicles are modelled as Quarter Car having 2 DOF and as Half Car having 4 DOF for EV and 5 DOF for ICE vehicle, because in the latter the engine is considered as a different lumped mass attached to the sprung mass. High frequency vibrations due to the unbalanced forces in the engine are also considered. This comparison is done for several case studies including vehicle-road interaction dynamics where road disturbances like speed breaker, step input, rumble strip and road roughness are considered. Vehicle-bridge interaction dynamics is also studied where the bridge is assumed as a simply supported Euler-Bernoulli beam and is considered to have road excitation due to a speed breaker followed by a class D road roughness on it. Simulations are performed on MATLAB Simulink evaluating vehicleâ€™s ride comfort, road holding ability, pitching, and vertical displacement.

However, though chatbots are making progress in having human-like conversations, there is a gap in research regarding enhancing the user experience through the form-based (visual and anthropomorphic) cues of the chatbot. This dissertation aims to address the research question regarding the impact of these design cues on user experience through the perspective of flow theory. \r\nThis study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 involved two survey-based studies (Study 1 â€“ moderate risk, Leviâ€™s, and Study 2 â€“ High risk, Jeep India) to  understand the correlations between the different design cues, antecedents and factors associated with flow under two scenarios of perceived risk. The results from Phase 1 showed that irrespective of the level of perceived risk, the functional design cues are fundamental to the chatbot. Of the two form-based design cues, in moderate-risk scenarios, such as purchasing a pair of jeans, conversational anthropomorphic cues are positively related to social presence and perceived challenge. At the same time, they increase perceived social presence and ease of use in high-risk scenarios, such as purchasing a car. \r\nIn Phase 2, two experimental studies were conducted. For the moderate-risk scenario, a 2 (Aesthetics: High, Low) x 2(Conversational Anthropomorphism: High, Low) full factorial experimental design was used. For the high-risk scenario, we conducted a one-shot field experiment where 134 real-time potential Hyundai / Volkswagen car customers were asked to interact with the respective chatbot. The results of Phase 2 comment further on combating the negative impact of aesthetic cues on user experience with chatbots. The results show that in moderately risky scenarios, aesthetics does not always have a negative impact on flow but only has a negative impact when the level of conversational anthropomorphic cues is higher. However, as the risk increases, it is seen that aesthetics have a negative impact on flow irrespective of the level of conversational anthropomorphic cues. However, results also show that in the case of high-risk chatbots, expressive aesthetic cues, or cues that contribute to the sophistication and creativity of the chatbot rather than to its organization, impact flow positively.\r\nThis study offers important implications for academicians and practitioners alike. The results of this thesis contribute to a growing body of academic research and literature on chatbots and integrate concepts from fundamental disciplines such as design science and user experience by opening up research on the topic. This research also has several critical managerial implications. This paper acts as a guide for chatbot designers and throws caution to practitioners regarding the use of highly visually appealing chatbots at different levels of risk and provides a way to mitigate this negative effect. With the advent of generative AI and the chatbot boom, this research becomes an essential piece of insight into designing and developing highly functional and human-like chatbots that provide optimal user experience.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION.-web confernce link https://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmad','','',1,'2024-05-02 12:27:49','Active'),(278,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Compact Model Validation and Extraction of Accurate Thermal Resistance of GaN HEMTs','Mr. Ajay Shanbhag Govindray (EE18D415) ','Ph.D Scholar Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. Amitava DasGupta','Electrical Engineering','2024/05/10 16:00','2024-05-10','yes','Online','We present the IIT Madras Compact Model (ICM) for GaN HEMTs, a comprehensive charge-based compact model that accurately captures DC, transient, and RF characteristics, including secondary effects like traps, access-region behavior, and self-heating.

Since our model is physics based, it requires much fewer parameters than other available compact models of GaN HEMTs. Validation against industry-standard experimental data confirms its accuracy.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel method for extracting the thermal resistance (RTH) of GaN on Silicon HEMTs. By pulsing the substrate bias instead of drain or gate biases, we mitigate the impact of traps, resulting in consistent RTH values across different wafers. This approach, validated through our ICM Model, demonstrates improved agreement with experimental data compared to conventional methods, highlighting its reliability in accurately determining thermal resistance in GaN-on-Si HEMTs.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/igc-nyrp-iua','','',1,'2024-05-03 04:43:55','Active'),(279,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Comparison of Ride Parameters of Electric and IC Engine Vehicle for Vehicle-Road and Vehicle-Bridge Interaction Dynamics','Mr.  KAUSTUBH DEEPAK KASLE   (ME21S038)','MS Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide Name: Dr. Shankar Krishnapillai (ME) / Co-guide Name: Dr. B Nageswara Rao (CE) / GTC Members Names: Dr. Parag Ravindran-ME, Dr. Gnanamoorthy R-ME, Dr. Sathish Kumar S R-CE.','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/05/07 15:00','2024-05-07','yes','Through Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/fcd-ygbd-jrd','Analysis of dynamic response of any vehicle has always been the most essential part for the design of its suspension system. This study aims to model an electric vehicleâ€™s suspension system, analyse its dynamic response, and compare it with a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle (petrol-powered). There is a significant difference in mass and weight distribution of an EV and ICE vehicle resulting in distinct dynamic response. The vehicles are modelled as Quarter Car having 2 DOF and as Half Car having 4 DOF for EV and 5 DOF for ICE vehicle, because in the latter the engine is considered as a different lumped mass attached to the sprung mass. High frequency vibrations due to the unbalanced forces in the engine are also considered. This comparison is done for several case studies including vehicle-road interaction dynamics where road disturbances like speed breaker, step input, rumble strip and road roughness are considered. Vehicle-bridge interaction dynamics is also studied where the bridge is assumed as a simply supported Euler-Bernoulli beam and is considered to have road excitation due to a speed breaker followed by a class D road roughness on it. Simulations are performed on MATLAB Simulink evaluating vehicleâ€™s ride comfort, road holding ability, pitching, and vertical displacement. In addition, the effect of vehicle velocity and flexural rigidity of the bridge on the ride parameters is also studied.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/fcd-ygbd-jrd','','',1,'2024-05-03 05:30:32','Active'),(280,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Fine Time Scale Stochastic Streamflow Modelling and Vine Copula Based Seasonal Design Flood Estimation','Ms. Shilpa L S, Roll No: CE14D059','Ph.D Scholar','Dr. Robinson R G - Administrative Guide, Dr. K.

A fixed offshore platform is typically designed for 25 years using the working stress design principle as per API RP 2A (WSD). The usage of the jacket structures may be extended due to the availability of oil and gas. Normally the life extension beyond original design will be 1 to 10 years. The design environmental period for the corresponding extended life is estimated using the encounter probability method. Then the structural integrity of the jacket structures is assessed using the ultimate strength assessment and the system reliability analysis methods. The ultimate strength assessment is defined in terms of Reserve Strength Ratio (RSR) of the jacket structures. The Reserve Strength Ratio (RSR) is a ratio of reserve capacity of the jacket structure to the design level environmental loads. However, the risk-based assessment of the jacket structures is evaluated based on the system probability of failure. \r\nIn this study, a typical jacket structure is selected, and the ultimate strength assessment of the jacket structure is evaluated using the push over analysis. The fault tree analysis method has been used to determine the critical member failure path of the jacket structure. Then the system probability of failure of the jacket structures has been computed using the First Order Reliability Method (FORM). Further this study aims to evaluate the required extended life of the aged jacket structure based on the encounter probability method. Finally, the present study proposes the acceptance criteria, recertification guidelines and the life extension recommendation of the jacket structure using the structural integrity and life extension assessment.\r\n','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-03 07:14:20','Active'),(282,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Supporting complex simulations with open source software','Prof. Wolfgang Bangerth ','Prof. Wolfgang Bangerth is currently a professor in the Department of Mathematics and a professor (by courtesy) in the Department of Geosciences at Colorado State University.

The major requirements for 3D concrete printing (3DCP) are dependent on pumpability, extrudability, buildability, and open time (all together called as printability). To achieve the rheological requirements for these design parameters, 3DCP mixture composition are designed with more binder content than conventional concrete. However, using a higher binder percentage in 3DCP creates challenges associated with sustainability. So, there is a need to use sustainable binder systems to reduce the environmental impact caused due to large scale carbon-dioxide emissions. Therefore, developing a low-carbon printable mixtures with the use of different alternative cementitious binders is important. Although, due to the use of sustainable binders, fast changing material properties at fresh state is observed which need to be studied. The use of sustainable binders in 3DCP has driven research into adapting various suites of test methods to assess these rigorous requirements. The current study presents a methodology to achieve a printable mix design for different sustainable binders used in construction industry. This study focuses on defining a range of test methods and its permissible suits of values which aims to measure different parameters such as flow spread value at fresh state, open time, setting time, static and dynamic yield stress growth with respect to time and phase separation assessment.','R.

This seminar will highlight the synthesis and application of innovative sustainable nanocomposites for the adsorptive removal of heavy metals from wastewater.1 Utilizing a combination of biodegradable polymers and environmentally benign nanoparticles, these nanocomposites offer a dual advantage of high adsorption capacity and ecological safety. The research methodology involved the synthesis of nanocomposites using materials such as chitosan, cellulose, and graphene oxide, which were then functionalized with metal oxide nanoparticles to enhance their affinity towards specific heavy metals like arsenic, fluoride, and uranium.2,3 Batch adsorption experiments demonstrated that these nanocomposites achieve superior removal efficiencies, attributable to their large surface area and the specific interaction between the metal ions and functional groups on the nanocomposites.4 The findings suggest that sustainable nanocomposites represent a promising, cost-effective, and eco-friendly approach for the removal of heavy metals from contaminated water sources, aligning with the goals of environmental sustainability and pollution mitigation. Future studies are recommended to explore the scalability of this technology and its efficacy in diverse real-world wastewater treatment scenarios. \r\nReferences:\r\n(1)	Taghipour, S.; Hosseini, S.

When the alphabet size is large compared to the number of samples, a portion of the distribution is highly likely to be unobserved or sparsely observed, and the error of the empirical distribution estimator is bounded below by missing mass, defined as the sum of probabilities over the missing letters. The Good-Turing (GT) estimator for missing mass is the ratio of the number of letters occuring once in the samples to the sample size. GT estimator is an important tool in large-alphabet distribution estimation and is widely used in natural language modelling for smoothing the empirical estimates. In this work, we propose various new notions and generalizations of missing mass that are useful to infer the missing parts of distributions from samples and characterize the minimax squared error risk of estimating these new types of missing mass under different sampling models, including those with memory. We show that the GT estimator or its appropriate modifications are minimax rate optimal for the proposed types of missing mass. We also propose new notions of concentration that provide better tail probability bounds, than sub-Gaussian concentration, for missing mass and its generalizations.

However, this process of reproductive angiogenesis is compromised in woman suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) leading to recurrent pregnancy loss and infertility in them. Studies have shown that circulating leukocytes are indispensable for reproductive angiogenesis, wherein, they participate by either trans-differentiating into endothelial-like cells or by secreting angiogenic factors. Previous study from our lab demonstrated that the circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from insulin resistant PCOS women exhibit defective adherence to fibronectin, one of the earliest steps necessary for leukocyte mediated homing and remodelling. Unlike Caucasians, Indian PCOS women do not exhibit overt hyperandrogenism, and instead, appearance of insulin resistance is more prevalent them. This is also corroborated by the fact that the use of insulin sensitizer, metformin, improves menstrual cyclicity, ovulation, fertility and endometrial receptivity in them, thereby demonstrating a strong link between Insulin resistance and female reproduction. The present study aims at unravelling the molecular reasons for impaired vasculogenic ability of PBMCS in PCOS women. Age matched PCOS and control women were recruited based on the Rotterdam criteria in this study. PCOS women exhibited higher fasting glucose and were found to be insulin resistant when compared to control subjects. These women also showed enlargement in their left ovary and increased endometrial thickness. PBMCs from PCOS women showed defective adherence on fibronectin, collagen and laminin but not on gelatin. Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) based proteomics was performed on PBMC fractions of recruited subjects to determine differential protein expression in these cells. Although the proteomic analysis did not show any change in the abundance of integrins between control and PCOS women, cell surface analysis using flow cytometry demonstrated a decrease in number of PBMCs positive for fibronectin binding integrins in PCOS women. The mechanism behind this still needs to be investigated. Since there is no established cell culture-based model available to mimic the endocrine imbalance observed during PCOS, attempts were made to establish a high fat high sucrose (HFHS) based PCOS model in C57BL6J mice.  HFHS based diet model of PCOS in C57BL6J female mice did not show any alterations in glucose metabolism but showed 50% success rate in development of polycystic ovaries. These mice also developed dyslipidaemia and altered liver function. The talk will summarize the observations obtained from aforementioned human and mice studies.

These nanoclusters exhibit quantum behavior, such as discrete electronic energy levels and size-dependent optical properties, like molecules, due to their small size and precise structure.1 Nanoclusters, typically made up of a few to several tens of atoms, display unique electrical,2 optical,3 magnetic,4 and catalytic5 properties that significantly distinguish them from both molecules and larger nanoparticles. These properties of nanoclusters make them ideal for various applications, ranging from highly efficient catalysts for chemical reactions to ultra-sensitive sensors and novel electronic devices. Furthermore, atomically precise nanoclusters offer tunability in structure and properties that are hard to achieve with larger nanoparticles and bulk materials. Because traditional materials currently in use are unable to maintain their stability and the attributes at very tiny scales,2 functional materials made of nanoclusters are highly desirable for a variety of applications. Because of their easy tuneability, understanding these traits in detail will aid in the design and synthesis of nanocluster materials with desired qualities. My proposal entails exploring the different features of nanoclusters and associated crystals, with the goal of employing them for a range of applications. I will be exploring the mechanical properties (to understand behaviour of clusters under stress), gas adsorption characteristics (for catalysis and gas storage), electrical transport (aiding in nanodevice development) and magnetic properties (to propose new class of molecular magnets). I will go over a thorough review of the literature in this seminar, along with some ideas on how to advance the subject of nanocluster research in the future.\r\nReferences\r\n(1)	Chakraborty, I.; Pradeep, T.

Examples are biomedical imaging and seismic imaging of the earth. \r\n\r\nIn many inverse problems, practitioners have an intuitive notion of how much one \"knows\" about the coefficient in different parts of the domain -- that is, that there is a spatially variable \"amount of information\". For example, in seismic imaging, we can only know about \r\nthose parts of the earth that are traversed by seismic waves on their way from earthquake to receiving seismometer, whereas we can not know about places not on these raypaths. \r\n\r\nDespite the fact that this concept of \"information\" is intuitive to understand, there are no accepted quantitative measures of information in inverse problems. I will present an approach to define such a spatially variable \"information density\" and illustrate both how it \r\ncan be computed practically, as well as used in applications.

To this end, we distinguish spillover effects into horizontal (intra-industry linkages) and vertical (backward or downstream and forward or upstream inter-industry linkages) spillovers. As a first step, semi-parametric methods are used to estimate firm level productivity. Further, we investigate productivity spillover across industries based on their technology intensity. The study finds that backward spillovers from the downstream MNEs is the only source of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) gains. Findings also suggest that industry heterogeneity is a key driver of FDI spillovers. As a second objective, this study analyze effects of firm capabilities on FDI spillover. We examines linear relation between absorptive capacity and technology spillover and further test the presence of nonlinear threshold effects. We find that the intermediate technology gap between domestic and foreign firms substantiates favorable impact of FDI spillovers on high-tech industries. As a final objective, we distinguish foreign subsidiaries based on their innovative activities into knowledge creator (KC) and knowledge user (KU) types. Econometric analysis shows that domestic suppliers of intermediate inputs benefit by interacting with the knowledge-creating subsidiaries. Notably, the backward-vertical linkage is primarily strong in the case of knowledge creators.\r\n','HSS OFFICE','hsoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkMeet link: meet.google.com/szm-refx-vej','','',1,'2024-05-06 05:13:51','Active'),(294,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Prediction And Reduction of Flow Induced Sound Generated by Cross Flow Past Circular Cylinders','Mr. Karthik K, Ph.D. scholar, Roll No. OE14D023 ','Mr. Karthik K, Ph.D. scholar, Roll No. OE14D023 ','DR.

Typically formed under high-pressure, low-temperature conditions and naturally found on deep ocean floors.1 However, their formation under low-temperature, high-vacuum laboratory conditions raises questions about their existence in the interstellar medium (ISM). Over 300 simple and complex molecules, including water, have been detected in the ISM in gas/solid phases. The extreme conditions of low temperature and pressure in the ISM prompt inquiries into the complex chemistry occurring through thermal and energetic processes in space.2 Here, we focused on the study simulating ISM conditions (P ~ 10-10 mbar, T~10-100 K) using a custom-built ultra-high vacuum (UHV) instrument. Our investigation primarily targets the formation of CHs and the evolution of molecules within their cages through thermal and photochemical processes utilizing techniques such as reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy, reflection high-energy electron diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. We showed the formation of ethane, dimethyl ether (DME), tetrahydrofuran THF, and 1,3- dioxalane CHs at temperatures of 60,125 and 135 K, respectively, in UHV. Additionally, thermally annealing mixed CHs of THF, DME, and carbon dioxide (CO2) induces the transformation of CO2 from sI to sII hydrate structures.3,4 Moreover, the investigation into the photolysis of DME CH underscores the importance of radical recombination processes within water cages, suggesting a mechanism for the selective formation of photoproducts. Our findings provide insights into the complex chemistry occurring in space environments, shedding light on the potential formation mechanisms of CHs and the evolution of molecules within them in the ISM.\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a sustainable method of converting solar energy into hydrogen.1 PEC involves two set of reactions hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The n-type metal-based semiconductors such as TiO2, SrTiO3, Ta2O5 can be tuned as photoanode materials to carry out oxygen evolution reaction. These materials can be easily synthesized by anodization and hydrothermal methods.2,3 However, OER is a 4-electron process and occurs at high potential of 1.23 VRHE. This makes OER a sluggish and energy intensive process. Conversely, HER is a two-electron mechanism that only happens at 0 VRHE. p-type semiconductors work best as photocathodes3. But obtaining p-type metal oxides with high hole mobility is difficult due to the considerable localization of holes around valence band edge of the metal oxides because of their ionicity. As a potential cure, covalency might be introduced to the metal-oxygen bonding to promote the formation of an enlarged valence-band structure. However, the synthesised p-type (Cu2O, CaFe2O4) semiconductors either exhibit photo-corrosion or have extremely limited charge mobility.4,5 The efficiency of the photoelectrochemical cell can be raised by using inexpensive, photostable photoelectrodes if n-type semiconductors are able to function as both photocathodes and photoanodes. To use n-type semiconductors as photocathodes, shallow trap levels must be introduced in order to capture photoexcited electrons and perform photoreduction6. It has been observed that doping with transition metals, such as Fe3+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Cr3+, is an effective way to create impurity levels, or trap states, in an array of metal oxides. Additionally, the doped transition metals aid in lowering the rate of recombination, which raises the efficiency of metal oxide7. Inducing defects is another excellent method of creating trap states below the conduction band of semiconductors. Role of N-defects in photocathodic behaviour of g-C3N4 has been successfully explored6. Based on these considerations, we have synthesised n-type semiconductors, Mn/Fe-TNT@Ti-500, N-doped SrTiO3, SBA-15/Mn/Fe-TNT@Ti-500, N-doped g-C3N4 and examined their potential use as photoelectrodes for overall water splitting.8 The results obtained on these photoactive materials will be discussed in this colloquium. \r\nReferences\r\n1.

The opportunities arise out of the potential to reduce undesirable and detrimental environmental changes and challenges in the form of excess load on the electricity transmission networks. This energy shift when supported by solar power, which is already emerging as a big contributor to the generation of electricity in the Indian ecosystem can be sustained. There is, however, a need to study how these changes to supply and demand align and the adaptations needed to ensure successful integration of the new. In this study, we, therefore, investigate how EVs change the electricity distribution scenarios in the Indian market. First, We look at the question of when to charge an electric vehicle by simulating the different scenarios and optimising for best distribution of demand. Next, we identify contract structures that would incentivise owners to follow the identified charging patterns. Finally, we explore whether the design would work as intended by validating the user behaviour via surveys and qualitative interviews.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','RESEARCH PROPOSAL SEMINAR -web confernce link https://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadra','','',1,'2024-05-06 13:40:55','Active'),(300,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','A Systematic Investigation of Detectors for Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio EMG Signals for application in EMG driven robot assisted therapy for severe stroke.','Ms. Monisha Yuvaraj (AM20D750)','Guide(s): Dr. S K M Varadhan & Dr. Sivakumar Balasubramanian, CMC, Vellore','Ph.

About 30% of stroke survivors are severely impaired and require physical assistance to actively engage in movement training. Robotic assistance can motivate such patients to attempt and train movements. When the robotic assistance is contingent on the intention to move, it may be an effective way to guide neuroplasticity. For severely impaired stroke patients with no residual movements, a surface electromyogram (EMG) is a viable option for detecting movement intention. Although numerous algorithms for EMG detection exist, the detector with the highest accuracy and lowest latency for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals remains unknown. Therefore, there is a need to identify an optimal EMG detector that can provide seamless, naturalistic human-machine interaction during robot-assisted therapy.\r\nTo this end, we investigated the performance of 13 existing EMG detection algorithms on simulated low SNR (0 dB and -3 dB) EMG signals generated using three different EMG signal models: Gaussian, Laplacian, and biophysical models. The detector performance was quantified using the false positive rate (FPR), false negative rate (FNR), and detection latency. Any detector that consistently showed FPR and FNR of no more than 20%, and latency of no more than 50 ms, was considered an appropriate detector for use in robot-assisted therapy.\r\nThe results indicate that the Modified Hodges detector â€“ a simplified version of the threshold-based Hodges detector â€“ introduced in the current work, was the most consistent detector across the different signal models and SNRs. It consistently performed for ~90% and ~40% of the tested trials for 0 dB and -3 dB SNR, respectively. The two statistical detectors (Gaussian and Laplacian Approximate Generalized Likelihood Ratio) and the Fuzzy Entropy detectors have a slightly lower performance than Modified Hodges.\r\nOverall, the Modified Hodges, Gaussian and Laplacian Approximate Generalized Likelihood Ratio, and the Fuzzy Entropy detectors were identified as the potential candidates that warrant further investigation with real surface EMG data since they had consistent detection performance on low SNR EMG data.\r\n','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline Meeting link: https://meet.google.com/ert-dvas-fnm','','',1,'2024-05-07 04:24:22','Active'),(301,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Physically derived instantaneous modelling of complex current-voltage waveform-controlled arc-wire DED process - Residual stress and distortion analysis.','Mr. Pradeep.

One of the key challenges of DED-made components is related to the thermally induced\r\nresidual stresses and distortion. The temperature gradient is caused mainly due localized heat input, and\r\nan accumulation of excessive heat in the fabricated part often leads to undesirable failures, such as poor\r\ndimensional tolerances due to the generation of residual stresses and degradation of mechanical\r\nproperties. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the influencing factors that impact the generation and\r\ndistribution of residual stress in DED-made components. In this work, numerical investigations to\r\nanalyse the evolution of the thermal profile, residual stress, and distortion during the deposition of\r\naluminium alloy 4047 wire on aluminium alloy (A1050, A6060) substrates were examined using a finite\r\nelement-based analysis. A novel Data-Driven Model approach described by the physically derived\r\ninstantaneous process parameters was used with the existing FE approach to model the multilayer\r\ndeposition by the wire-arc DED process. The temperature distribution, residual stress generation, and\r\ndistortion were investigated in three different substrates: a block (Case I), a large plate (Case II), and a\r\nsmall plate (Case III). The numerical results were validated with experimentally measured data. The\r\nproposed DDM-based thermo-mechanical simulation predicted the peak temperature with a mean\r\nrelative error of 3.3 %, 4.8 %, and 3.4 % for the three cases considered, respectively. Furthermore, the\r\nmagnitude and variation trend of the residual stress and distortion near the deposited region in Case III\r\nagreed well with the experimental results. The simulated results of the DDM approach show the\r\nsignificance of the boundary conditions, especially the clamping, in mitigating the residual stressinduced distortion of DED-processed parts.\r\n','EDOffice','edoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-07 06:57:44','Active'),(302,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','â€œClassification of multi symmetric products of a curve and its applications\"','Dr.Arijit Mukherjee ','IPDF, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','.','Department of Mathematics','2024/05/08 15:00','2024-05-08','yes','NAC Room No.519, 5th Floor.',': In this talk, we completely classify multi symmetric products, i.e product of symmetric products, of a curve.

These coping mechanisms are called hardship financing practices, such as selling assets or livestock and borrowing from friends, family, or money lenders to smoothen consumption expenditure. Examining data from two waves of the NSSO (71st and 75th rounds), this thesis delves into the scope and drivers of hardship financing and its resultant financial strain in India. Logistic regression analysis reveals cancer as the predominant cause of hardship financing among the study population. Over time, there\'s a decrease in hardship financing for inpatients but an increase for outpatients. Employing a multivariate decomposition analysis, we investigate the factors driving the decline in inpatient hardship financing, noting that while factors such as catastrophic health expenditure have impoverishing effects on hardship financing, there is evidence of a potential to slow down this negative impact. Furthermore, significant rural-urban disparities in hardship financing are uncovered. The Fairlie decomposition analysis underscores income status and living conditions as pivotal factors exacerbating rural disadvantage in hardship financing. A qualitative analysis in Kerala\'s Pathanamthitta district highlights inadequate government interventions, subpar conditions in government hospitals, poor savings practices, and loss of employment due to illness as key contributors to hardship financing.

This study aims to locate the ways in which photographs became part of the processes of survival and resurgence for the exiled Sri Lankan Tamil community settled in Tamil Nadu, India. Addressing a notable lacuna in scholarly discourse concerning the Sri Lankan refugee community in India and the limited corpus of photographic documentation, this study proposes a comprehensive inquiry into visual materials using the tools of socio-cultural and visual anthropology. By focusing on family albums as primary source material, this ethnographic investigation seeks to unravel the intricate interplay between photography and the lived experiences of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, probing the complexities of displacement and resilience amid protracted conflict dynamics. This narrative extends beyond sensationalized images, embracing the quotidian experiences of ordinary individuals impacted by the conflict.\r\n\r\nAcknowledging the dynamic nature of photographs, this research attempts to decipher the nuanced meanings embedded within images amidst war. Beyond mere visual representation, the inquiry delves into the multifaceted processes encompassing the production, dissemination, circulation, preservation, and even obliteration of photographs. Central to this exploration is the theme of displaced imagery, particularly the photographs carried by Sri Lankan Tamil refugees fleeing their homeland, which encapsulate narratives persisting despite displacement. Within this framework, attention is directed towards elucidating the phenomenon of lost or damaged images, illuminating the poignant narratives and memories immortalized therein, even in their absence. Specifically, this study scrutinizes the significance of seemingly mundane photographs originating from everyday life, which assume pivotal roles in the cultural, social, and legal spheres of the refugee community, fostering notions of identity and evidentiary citizenship. Extending this discourse, the analyzed images are positioned within the broader photographic history of Sri Lanka and South Asia, underscoring their enduring relevance. Through this inquiry, the aim is to solicit narratives encapsulated within images, interwoven with themes of displacement, identity, memory, home, encampment, and culture.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Photography; Memory; Refugee; Visual Anthropology','HSS OFFICE','hsoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-07 08:37:10','Active'),(306,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL',' GENTLE REMINDER - Supporting complex simulations with open source software','Prof. Wolfgang Bangerth','Prof. Wolfgang Bangerth is currently a professor in the Department of Mathematics and a professor (by courtesy) in the Department of Geosciences at Colorado State University.

These MI- EEG signals are recorded when the subject performs imagery motor task. Each subject has specific patterns because of the spatial origin, change in amplitude and brain signals thus calibration process is necessary. In present BCI systems, calibration is often tedious process which cause mental fatigue for the subject. The extended calibration time has thus become a significant drawback of BCI systems. Furthermore, for real-time BCI applications, it is imperative to enhance classification accuracy and reduce the complexity of deep learning models used for classifying MI-EEG signals. To address these challenges, we employed a genetic algorithm-based transfer learning approach to transfer knowledge from known subjects to unknown subjects. Additionally, we introduced an EEG channel-wise attention module and a hard trial removal methodology to improve classification accuracy of the deep learning model. Model complexity was further reduced through magnitude-based weight pruning and optimal EEG channel selection using Shapley additive explanation.

SNS provides a platform for various communities and creates a dark world of cybercrimes. Cybercriminals utilize social media to gather information, plan, and commit offenses. The increasing occurrence of cybercrimes on SNS platforms has drawn growing research interest. Consequently,  a systematic analysis was conducted using 26 research articles from reputed journals, predominantly from Information Systems. From this analysis, we identified three primary themes concerning cybercrimes: first is direct cybercrimes, where offenders directly harm victims (such as cyberbullying and cyberstalking); second is indirect cybercrimes, where offenders influence targets to engage in criminal activities (including cyberactivism and crime sensing); and third is the impact of cybercrime on SNS users. We also propose a conceptual framework grounded in the Routine Activity Theory (RAT) for analyzing cybercrimes. These themes and theoretical foundation address cybercrime from offendersâ€™ perspectives and their behavior. However, little attention has been given to constructing a cybercrime typology from the victim\'s perspective and assessing the severity of cybercrime. For this mapping of a set of reported cybercrimes to the formal crime types defined in the Indian Penal Code, IT Act 2000, and the amendments thereof is proposed. Further, a measurement process will be developed to score cybercrimes based on their severity. This will involve pilot testing, establishing baseline scores, formal scoring by various subject groups, and tests for reliability and validity. In order to establish internal consistency, two scales will be used: an interval scale and a ratio scale with a standard crime item for scoring. To establish validity and reliability through correlations,  four different subject groups were engaged related to cybercrimes. This research will contribute to the IS body of knowledge in cybercrimes by developing a measurement process to generate actionable information. The insights generated from this study will also support law enforcement agencies in making informed decisions on deploying their scarce resources.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','RESEARCH PROPOSAL SEMINAR-web confernce link  https://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadra','','',1,'2024-05-07 10:44:24','Active'),(310,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Non-linear analysis of FPSO under directional wave & Fatigue life prediction ','Mr. Siddarth George - OE18D009','Mr. Siddarth George - OE18D009, Ph.D Scholar','Prof. Deepak kumar - Guide','OCEAN ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT','2024/05/09 03:30','2024-05-09','yes','SEMINAR HALL, DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','FPSOs, or Floating Production Storage Offloading systems, are extremely relevant\r\nstructures in the field of offshore engineering. The use of such systems all across the world\r\nhighlights the need for understanding their behavior and response across a wide range of system\r\ndetails and sea conditions. Various parameters such as water depth, mooring line length, direction\r\nof wave incidence, significant wave height, truncation of mooring lines, 3D sea state environment\r\netc. have significant impact on the dynamic behavior of FPSOs and on the fatigue lives of their\r\nmooring lines. A study on summarizing the effect of changes in the above mentioned parameters\r\nis the focus of the present work. A standard FPSO (300m long; 1000m water depth) is modelled\r\nand analyzed using ANSYS AQWA. Then, using this as the base model, multiple variations of it\r\nare created to capture and study the effects of changes in parameters.\r\nThe first part of the study is about revisiting the concept of truncation of mooring lines. A\r\ntruncated model is created which effectively reduces the water depth from 1000m in the real world\r\nto a truncated water depth of 300m. This procedure finds significance in wave basin studies. The\r\neffect of the changes in the behavior of FPSOs upon truncating its mooring lines are studied and\r\ndocumented. The results showcase the effectiveness of the truncation procedure upon a standard\r\nFPSO system. The second part of the study is a broad parametric study of the FPSO system.\r\nVariations of the base model are created with changes in various parameters such as water depth,\r\nmooring line length, direction of wave incidence, significant wave height, 2D to 3D sea state\r\nenvironment etc. The respective models are then compared to one another. The results here\r\nshowcase the trends in the behavior of FPSOs across changes in each particular parameter. The\r\nthird part of the study is a fatigue analysis.

Variations\r\nof the base model are created with changes in various parameters such as water depth, mooring\r\nline length, direction of wave incidence, significant wave height, 3D to 2D sea state environment,\r\ntruncation of mooring lines etc. A sea state is modelled for fatigue analysis, which constitutes of a\r\n3D JONSWAP wave loading along with appropriate wind and current loading. A deterministic\r\nfatigue analysis is conducted to calculate the fatigue damage. The damage is then expressed in\r\nterms of fatigue lives of the respective mooring lines, and compared from model to model.

A typical body-in-white of a passenger car may contain up to 6000 similar and dissimilar resistance spot welds. These welded structures undergo vibration from road surface, engine, floor panel, etc., and the resultant cyclic loading on the spot welds leads to fatigue failure. The performance of the welds under dynamic and static loading is therefore crucial to ensure the long-life of an automotive vehicle. Recently, ultrahigh strength steel sheets with lesser thicknesses are being used in the automobile industries to fabricate car bodies. The current research is on the understanding of fatigue failure mechanisms in similar and dissimilar resistance spot welded joints of DP 980 steel and boron-added ultrahigh strength steel.\r\n\r\nSpot welding was done with welding parameters optimized for industrially accepted nugget diameter. DP 980 steel â€“ DP 980 steel joints, boron steel â€“ boron steel joints and DP 980 steel â€“ boron steel joints were made. A few sheets of DP 980 steel were deformed in uniaxial tension to different levels and then the sheets were spot welded. Also, double pulsed resistance spot welding was used to weld DP 980 steel and boron steel. Microstructural observations were made on the welds and microhardness was measured. Tensile testing was done on the spot-welded specimens in lap shear mode. Fatigue testing was conducted on the spot-welded specimens in lap shear mode at different maximum load levels (5 to 40 % of weld strength) with the load ratio of 0.1. Fracture surfaces of the tested samples were observed using a scanning electron microscope.\r\n\r\nThree different types of fatigue failure mechanisms are observed for the welded joints of DP 980 steel and boron steel: eyebrow shape failure at low loads, partial plug failure at intermediate loads and plug failure at high loads. The transition in the fatigue failure mechanism from the eyebrow shape failure to the partial plug failure was observed when the maximum cyclic load was corresponding to 25 % of weld strength. It is found that the welds of DP 980 steel can be used in service at loads below 25 % of weld strength. Prior tensile deformation did not lead to any detrimental effect on the fatigue strength of the welded DP 980 steel. Double pulsed spot welded joints exhibited superior fatigue lives compared to the conventional spot welded joints.\r\n\r\nKey words: Resistance spot welding, double pulsing, weld strength, DP 980 steel, boron steel, fatigue, eyebrow shape failure, partial plug failure, plug failure.','MME Office','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-07 11:01:08','Active'),(312,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','ON THE APPLICATION OF A NEW DENSITY BASED APPROACH FOR STUDYING DAMAGE OF ELASTOMERIC SOLIDS','Mr. Karunakaran.

Cavitation represents a specific form of damage wherein pre-existing micro-voids or defects rapidly expand into voids and cavities of comparable sizes when stress is applied, ultimately leading to structural failure. This phenomenon results in localized reductions in density at those locations. Leveraging this understanding, we conceptualize pre-existing defects within elastomeric bodies as regions of lower density and ascertain the initiation of damage by monitoring density reductions across different locations within the body under varying loads. To validate this approach, we formulated and solved various boundary value problems to simulate the loading conditions experienced by elastomeric components containing weld lines. \r\nA weldline emerges as a defect in molding when two or more polymeric melt fronts meet and solidify during the mold filling process. Due to factors such as limited molecular chain diffusion across the interface, weak bonding between the joined skin layers, and the presence of air traps, the mechanical properties of the weldline region are inferior to those of the parent material. Consequently, the density in the weldline region is slightly lower. In our research, we model the weldline region with reduced density compared to the rest of the body and define material parameters as functions of this non-uniform density field. By applying load, we monitor density reductions at different locations to pinpoint the initiation of damage within the body. We employ an inhomogeneous compressible isotropic Gent model to represent the elastomeric material. Our analysis involves subjecting an elastomeric plate with a hole containing a weld line to various loading conditions and examining the initiation of damage in each scenario. Furthermore, when examining the problem of a plate containing a weldline, we explore how geometric characteristics such as orientation, length, and curvature of the weldline impact the initiation of damage.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-07 11:01:34','Active'),(313,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Development of Earth-Abundant Transition Metal-Based Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Rechargeable Zinc-Air Batteries','Ms. Terlapu Sai Vani (MM18D703)','Ph.D Scholar, Dept. of MME','Guide: Dr. Ranjit Bauri','Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering','2024/05/08 15:00','2024-05-08','yes','Seminar Hall (NAC 222)','The escalating global energy demand and environmental pollution have necessitated the \r\ndevelopment of advanced energy storage and conversion technologies.

Nevertheless, the challenges associated with variations in lithological distributions associated with the presence of shale layers, fractures, faults and leaky wells can affect the storage and the operational aspects of CO2 sequestration in these formations. The present work focuses on developing a mathematical model for understanding CO2 migration in different deep saline aquifers, such as heterogeneous and leaky deep saline aquifers. The present study is carried out to understand the impact of different petro-physical parameters of the deep saline aquifers on the migration and dissolution of CO2 gas in brine during sequestration operations. Further, the present model is extended with a thermo-hydraulic coupling to understand the effect of the degree of heterogeneity in porosity and permeability evolution and leakage rates from a leakage path during CO2 injection into a deep saline aquifer. The results depict that the plume length of CO2 gas is significantly influenced by changes in permeability, injection velocity, capillarity and interfacial tension. During sequestration, the permeability of the heterogeneous aquifer is observed to vary, which is expressed in terms of the permeability ratio (k/k0) by about 1.07 to 1.01 magnitudes in the low permeable conditions. Similarly, a significant modification in the average porosity is also observed, varying from a minimum of 0.791 % to a maximum of 3.136 %. Further, during CO2 injection into the leaky aquifer, variations in leakage path distance from the injection source, the thickness of the leakage path, permeability, and depth of the aquifer and leakage path system are observed to affect the CO2 migration. It is critically observed that a variation in leakage thickness from 0.1 to 0.5 m and a decrease in the permeability from 10-13 m2 to 10-15 m2  projected a significant variation in normalised leakage rate from 0.04 to 0.38 and 0.22 to 0.004. Hence, the present studies help mitigate gas and optimise injection and monitoring strategies during field development for effective storage and ensure safe gas storage for longer durations.      \r\n\r\n','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-07 11:06:24','Active'),(316,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Motor Imagery EEG signal recognition using Time-Frequency Representations and Convolutional Neural Networks','Ms. V Srimadumathi','Guide : Dr. M Ramasubba Reddy','Ph.

Most of the existing classification algorithms for the MI based BCI systems use EEG data from multiple channels for decoding the MI tasks, which increase the computational complexity of the system, thereby expending a higher time. The aim of this research is to effectively classify the MI tasks by utilizing the EEG data acquired from a minimal number of channels. As the brainâ€™s oscillations are transient, there is a need to analyse the EEG signals in both time and frequency domains. But the existing time-frequency methods provide a suboptimal trade-off between the time and frequency resolutions, thereby hindering the analysis of the neuronal signals. A novel method using a set of Complex Morlet Wavelets (CMW), having frequency dependent widths is used in this work to generate high-resolution time-frequency representations (TFR) of the MI EEG signals. These TFRs are further given to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), built with minimal number of layers for classification. Generally, a CNN model requires a large amount of training data and needs to learn many hyperparameters to give an optimal performance. Simple CNN models having lesser hyperparameters are built in this work for classifying the MI data from a smaller dataset. The acquired results show that the proposed CNN models are able to classify the high-resolution TFRs of the MI tasks with a higher classification accuracy using data from a lesser number of channels.

Some of the popular HP methods include (i) the compensation heat pulse (CHP) method, (ii) the T-max method, and (iii) the heat ratio (HR) method. Most other sap flow methods use some variations of these basic methods. Although all these methods are based on the same theory, in practice, their accuracy varies depending on the estimated HP velocity. Some of the often-cited reasons for the differences in the performance of these methods are (i) wound effect, (ii) asymmetrical spacing of temperature probes, (iii) low logging frequency, (iv) sensor resolution, (v) electronic noise, (vi) drift in temperature measurements, etc. However, it is unclear why these error artifacts affect the performance of different methods at different HP velocity ranges. Here, we use mathematical model simulations to show that the presence of noise in temperature measurements constrains the measurable range of HP velocities of these different methods depending on the noise intensity. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we quantitatively assess the accuracy of these methods. While typical HP measurements log temperature data every second for about 3 min, most HP methods only use a few data points. We show that when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of these chosen data points is small, the accuracy suffers. By employing a sum of squares error minimization (SSEM) approach that minimizes the errors between observed and model-predicted temperatures using all the observed data points, we show that noise induced errors in sap flow measurement can be virtually eliminated over a range of conditions. At the same time, our research explores the thermal dynamics involved in sap flow estimation. By utilizing porous media concepts such as mechanical dispersion, we simplify the diurnal fluctuation of thermal diffusivity in sapwood. Employing a non-empirical method for parameter estimation from temperature curves, we demonstrate a significant reduction in estimation errors. Our study not only advances the mechanistic understanding of noise-induced errors in sap flow measurements but also introduces a novel approach to improve estimation accuracy through the integration of porous media principles. \r\n\r\n\r\n','R.

A number of physiological sensors are known to develop a BCI system, out of which electroencephalogram (EEG) is popular among practitioners as it is convenient and effective. Motor Imagery (MI) is defined as the â€œmental rehearsal of movements without the movements being executedâ€. BCI systems have utilized MI to control the action of devices such as wheelchairs or an object on the monitor (e.g., cursor). To date, most BCI systems research focused on synchronous control applications, where the system initiates the time period during which the user is expected to perform the MI task. Alternatively, asynchronous BCI systems are way close to the ideal conditions, where the users donâ€™t need to follow systems instructions, and they can intend MI activity whenever they want. In such systems, detecting a non-intentional activity period (i.e., no-control state) is equally important. Developing a classifier that classifies MI tasks efficiently and discriminates intentional MI tasks from the no-control state activity without having training samples for the no-control state is always critical. The aim of this work is to develop a self-paced asynchronous BCI system with robust non-control state detection using an endogenous brain switch, which can determine if the user wants to use the system, thereby reducing the number of false positive operations significantly.

However, at sufficiently higher intensities, nonlinear absorption takes place by multiphoton processes and field-assisted collisional ionization. For longer pulse durations (Ï„_p), Ï„_p > 200 fs, laser-driven electrons can gain large kinetic energies by mechanisms such as inverse bremsstrahlung and electron avalanches, in short pulses, Ï„_p < 200 fs, these electrons are excited to the conduction band by multiphoton absorption [1]. In order to study field-dependent ionization processes, we have measured single-shot nonlinear transmission from the quartz crystal. The pulsewidth (50 fs - 1 ps) dependence of nonlinear transmission for laser pulses from a Ti: Sapphire femtosecond laser, tightly focused into quartz is discussed. The change in the absorption threshold as a function of pulsewidth and polarization is explained using the nonlinear ionization mechanism involved during the interaction [2].\r\nAs an application to the intense field interaction with materials we have established fs-pulsed laser ablation in liquid (fs-PLAL) technique to synthesize and control the optical properties of quantum dots (QDs). We have chosen ZnO, Mg-ZnO and MoS2 for studying the optical properties by varying the laser parameters i.e. pulsewidth and average power. Using this method, we have demonstrated the single-step reagent free synthesis of pristine ZnO QDs with selective tuning of emission properties by controlling the deep level defects. We have demonstrated the emission properties that can be used for fluorescent ink for anticounterfeit and pH sensing. Additionally, we have also demonstrated the enhancement of UV absorption and near band emission properties by doping Mg into the ZnO QDs [3]. During our investigation of the photoluminescence (PL) emission properties in MoS2 QDs synthesised using fs-PLAL method, we have discovered that the Stokes shift of ~ 1 eV is caused by the formation of a heterostructure between MoS2 and MoO3-x. To explain the large Stokes shift, a mechanism is proposed based on the electron transfer from MoS2 to MoO3-x, which is validated from excitation wavelength dependent PL and PL lifetime measurements [4].\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1]	P.

The study comprises three main components: developing kinetic models for methanol synthesis for COâ‚‚, techno-economic analyses of different process possibilities for COâ‚‚ utilization to methanol, and a nationwide evaluation of COâ‚‚ utilization strategies in sectors with significant emissions.\r\n\r\nThe initial stage of the research involves the development of two microkinetic models, based on Density Functional Theory (DFT), to study the COâ‚‚ hydrogenation reaction using two distinct copper-based catalysts. These models, validated with experimental data, provide critical insights into the reaction mechanisms, thus facilitating the optimization of catalyst design and reaction conditions. Subsequently, the study explores various methods for converting COâ‚‚ into methanol, incorporating a comprehensive techno-economic analysis. This analysis scrutinizes the energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impact of these methods, intending to identify key techno-enviro-economic challenges and ascertain the feasibility and sustainability of the proposed technologies. Additionally, the research evaluates the potential for integrating COâ‚‚ as a reactant in existing methanol production facilities to enhance COâ‚‚ utilization and methanol yield. This segment compares the benefits and drawbacks of establishing new facilities versus retrofitting existing ones for COâ‚‚ utilization. The final part of the research is about developing a COâ‚‚ assessment and monitoring framework, mainly targeting the hard-to-abate sectors such as cement and steel. These industries are crucial for Indiaâ€™s GDP and rank among the highest in carbon emissions, making them pivotal in Indiaâ€™s journey towards a net-zero carbon footprint. This framework aims to enable detailed analysis and scenario projection for national carbon management and greenhouse gas emissions, thereby assessing the efficacy of COâ‚‚ utilization strategies in mitigating carbon emissions at the national level.','K P Geetha','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link link: https://meet.google.com/eqe-xozi-fts','','',1,'2024-05-09 05:19:39','Active'),(322,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€˜â€™MODELS FOR PRODUCT POSITIONING, PATENT PROFILING, AND ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS IN THE INDIAN MACHINE TOOL INDUSTRY.â€™â€™','Ms.MAHAK BISEN, Roll no.

These rotor-shaft tilt angles are necessary for avoidance of tower strike of blades. Therefore, in modern wind turbines, a nacelle offset is present. Three different rotor-shaft tilt angles, viz, 3Âº, 5Âº, and 8Âº are chosen for the study. Firstly, a range of uniform wind speeds (seven values from below-rated to cut-out) is considered along with a significant wave height of 6m and peak period of 10s. The monopile with a rigid foundation (without soil effects) at the water depth of 20m is considered for the given turbine configuration. The analysis of the tower base moments, tip clearance, and blade pitch angle for these degrees of misalignment at different wind speeds has been made. In the process, the variation caused by this effect is shown. From the analysis, it is observed that the blade pitch angle is not much affected by the shaft misalignment, also it has been found that with an increase in the degree of misalignment tip clearance increases. The tower base roll moment and tower base torsion are significantly increased at the rated wind speed. The tower base torsion is significantly affected by shaft misalignment as compared to other loads and this loading effect is defined by the torsional load factor. This analysis is further extended to include the turbulent wind condition in the range of wind speeds from below-rated (i.e., 5m/s, 8m/s) to above-rated (i.e., 14m/s, 18m/s) to achieve more accurate prediction of loading patterns across various components of wind turbine. The effect of rotor-shaft tilt angle, and wind speed at different turbulence intensities, viz, A, B, C on various parameters have been analysed for the above-mentioned wind turbine configuration. The parameters that are analysed are loads entering the drivetrain i.e., rotor thrust, rotor torque, loads acting at the blade root system, loads that are acting on blades, Blade pitch angle, blade tip to tower clearance, and tower base loads. The effect of turbulence in the wind and rotor shaft tilt angle is analysed on the above-mentioned parameters. The change in rotor-shaft tilt angle could occur during installation and set-up activities, dynamics at the rotor-nacelle assembly sometimes cause the shaft to move out of the alignment. Hence, the effect of tilt angle on different parameters has been studied at various wind speeds with different turbulent intensities. Different turbulence intensities lead to different loading patterns on the wind turbine. It has been found that some parameters such as yaw bearing loads, and tower base moments have been significantly affected by both rotor-shaft tilt angle and turbulent wind speed conditions. Blade tip to tower clearance is varying by the change in rotor-shaft tilt angle. The blade pitch angle is greatly affected by the different turbulent intensities in the wind speed.\r\n\r\n','Department of Ocean Engineering','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-09 12:31:30','Active'),(326,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Computational investigation of liquid phase partial oxidation of methane to methanol on atomically dispersed catalysts.','MS.

Recently, there has been attention on atomically dispersed catalysts in metal oxide/zeolite supports for the aqueous phase partial oxidation of methane, using liquid hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant.\r\n\r\nAtomically dispersed Rh on t-ZrO2 and CeO2 nanowires (NWs) can convert methane to methanol using H2O2 as the oxidant and also form other products like CH3OOH and CO2. Here the objectives of this investigation are 1) to establish the active site characteristics of the 0.3 wt% of Rh on ZrO2 and 0.29 wt% of Rh on CeO2 NWs, satisfying all the experimental catalyst characterization data, 2) to identify an appropriate value of the Hubbard U correction for use with the Zr 4d states, and 3) to unravel the reaction mechanism and pathways for the formation of CH3OH and CH3OOH during methane oxidation on Rh/t-ZrO2 with hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. This investigation employed computational IR spectroscopy using CO as the probe molecule to identify the active site characteristics of supported Rh SAs on t-ZrO2 and CeO2 NWs. t-Rh0.03Zr0.97O2(200) and Rh0.02Ce0.98O2(110) surfaces show the formation of the geminal di-carbonyl with the computed vibrational frequencies closely matching those from the DRIFTS experiments in the literature. However, the widely studied t-Rh0.03Zr0.97O2(101) and Rh0.03Ce0.97O2(111) surfaces in the literature donâ€™t form geminal di-carbonyl on the surface. Investigations reinforce the need to carefully assess the characteristic active site motifs in single-atom catalysts formed in metal oxides. Additionally, CH4 and H2O probe molecules were utilized to estimate the Hubbard U for use with t-ZrO2, and Hubbard-U on Zr was obtained to be 2.5 eV. The mechanistic analysis of methane partial oxidation on t-Rh0.02Zr0.98O2(200) with U=2.5 eV on Zr revealed the critical role of CO in the formation of CH3OOH, which is one of the key products observed during the partial oxidation reaction.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the catalytic systems investigated in the literature use water as the solvent, a study on Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst showed that the use of a mixture of sulfolane and water as solvent enhanced methanol selectivity compared to water. Classical MD simulations of the reactants and the products in these solvents showed a substantial difference in transport properties, compared to water. The observed higher selectivity of methanol on the Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst in sulfolane and its aqueous mixtures could potentially be because of a combination of the effects on transport of the reactants and products, and their involvement in the elementary reactions. The current studies would be extended to predict the roles of solvent sulfolane in altering reaction mechanisms and energetics on t-Rh/ZrO2 as the catalytic system.','K P Geetha','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkONLINE: https://meet.google.com/fsk-vnta-bnuâ€¬â€¬','','',1,'2024-05-10 04:04:59','Active'),(327,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Ph.D SEMINAR TALK -II -  A System-Thinking-Based Synthesis of Critical Factors Influencing the Pathways to Resilient Safety Culture for Construction Projects of Different Sizes','Mr. Kaushik Bhattacharjee, Roll No. CE20D008','Ph.D Scholar','Dr. Nikhil Bugalia - Guide, Dr. Ashwin Mahalingam - Co-Guide, Dr. Koshy Varghese - DC Member, Dr. Sivakumar Palaniappan - DC Member, Dr. Shankar Narasimhan S (CH) - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head','Civil Engineering','2024/05/13 15:00','2024-05-13','yes','BSB 104 (Conference Room)','The varied nature of the construction industry, involving projects of different sizes, poses significant challenges to improving its Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) performance. One of the most prominent solutions is to develop a positive safety culture on construction projects.  Moreover, most existing literature analyzing the safety culture for construction projects either focuses on larger projects or does not distinguish the results for projects of varying sizes. However, the scarce existing literature identifying strategies for improving the safety culture of smaller construction projects has focused on a deterministic and reactive view of safety. The recent paradigms for safety management recognize the construction sector as a complex socio-technical system, producing \'irregularâ€™ or â€˜unexpected unknownâ€™ safety risks. Therefore, as an alternative, the Resilient Safety Culture (RSC) model, which focuses on developing adaptive capabilities to manage the ever-changing irregular and unforeseen safety risks, is deemed suitable. However, limited academic attention has been paid to identifying the pathways construction projects of different sizes need to follow to achieve RSC dimensions, through RSC-based practices. Therefore, the current study tries to answer the fundamental question â€œDo construction projects of different sizes have a uniform pathway to safety culture?â€ Literature also suggests that national-level safety governance structure plays a crucial role in promoting safety practices and, consequently, the safety culture of an organization. Safety governance structure represents how the laws and regulations surge through the different hierarchy levels of the construction industry by distributing the responsibility, accountability, and authority of the public and private safety stakeholders, leading to better safety management. Therefore, the role of the safety governance structure may also be crucial in achieving the RSC for construction projects of different sizes. However, the extant literature on identifying the features of a safety governance structure has been limited to unstructured and not necessarily rooted in theoretical frameworks for analyzing the governance structure of the construction industry. Hence, the current study also tries to address the important question â€œWhat are the characteristics of the existing construction safety governance structure that can affect the pathway to safety culture?â€\r\nTo assess the pathways toward safety culture, the current study has adopted an RSC-based questionnaire to which 180 survey responses from site professionals were obtained. A concurrent triangulation mixed method was used to analyze this data, supplemented with 16 interviews and field observations from 27 building construction projects in India. The \'contract value\' was used as a metric to aggregate the responses for three project types, i.e., \'small\', \'medium\', and \'large\'. Consequently, the current study first identified the significant differences in safety practices through a Resilience Engineering (RE) based analytical framework. Further, the current study uses Structural Equation Modelling to identify whether safety practices have a uniform effect on the dimensions of RSC, leading to uniform pathways for construction projects of different sizes. Whereas, to analyze the safety governance structure, the current study relies on Systems Theoretical Processes Analysis (STPA), a system-thinking-based approach proven effective in analyzing the stakeholders and their relationships in the construction sector. Analysis of existing Laws, Regulations, and Subject matter expertsâ€™ interviews were collected and synthesized for identifying the Safety Control Structure (SCS). Further, a generic analysis of SCS and a detailed analysis of each hierarchy-level actor were conducted to identify possible human and organizational errors.\r\nThe findings reveal that construction projects of different sizes have significant differences in their safety practices. However, unlike those reported in the previous literature, the results indicate that smaller projects do not consistently perform poorly than larger projects across safety practices. Moreover, the study reveals that the effect of similar safety practices in improving the RSC dimensions is not uniform across projects of different sizes. This finding contrasts with much of the existing literature that recommends emulating successful pathways from larger construction projects for smaller projects. The study results also provide novel implications for safety practitioners in identifying different strategic pathways for attaining RSC for projects of different sizes. Moreover, an understanding of the causes of a dysfunctional safety governance structure is provided by the STPA analysis, which highlights a gap in the feedback processes and relationships between the actors across different hierarchy levels. This could influence the norms of the organizations by slashing the safety practices necessary for minimum compliance, which would result in a degraded pathway toward RSC. Lastly, to strengthen the safety governance structure of the construction industry, the current study identifies likely organizational and human errors, which can help improve the intended critical roles and responsibilities of construction stakeholders, promoting better safety practices and consequently driving toward improved pathways toward resilient safety culture.\r\n','R.

The \r\nsteelmaking processes at the industry scale are very complex in nature and highly \r\ninhomogeneous and work under non-equilibrium conditions. A modeling approach has been \r\nemployed in this work by dividing the process regions into different zones, where highly mixed \r\nareas are considered in thermodynamic equilibrium and connected through the flow of streams \r\nwith each other. The model developed with such consideration employs a multi-zone reactor \r\napproach, considering thermochemical and kinetic factors to predict the liquid steel and slag \r\nphases\' temperature, composition, and volume. The study explicitly investigates decarburization \r\nrates and their contributions from various zones, including the hotspot generated by the jet \r\nimpact, the slag-metal-gas emulsion zone, and the bath boiling region. Modified kinetic \r\nparameters (represented as parameters inialpha, inibeta, and inigamma) were adjusted within \r\nappropriate ranges, using the hotspot temperature as a reference point, ranging from 2000 to \r\n3000Â°C, to assess the mixing levels in the metal bath. Remarkably, the current model aligns \r\nclosely with actual observations concerning carbon removal during the process. According to the \r\nmodel\'s findings, the most substantial contribution to decarburization predominantly occurs \r\nduring the initial phases of blowing, primarily driven by reactions in the hotspot. However, as the \r\nprocess progresses, it becomes increasingly influenced by the emulsion zone. This model \r\nprovides reasonable predictions for carbon removal rates under operating conditions in the steel \r\nindustry. The purpose of the current model was to understand decarburization phenomena in \r\nBOF converter. The model is also integrated with other sub-models like scarp, iron ore, flux \r\ndissolution, and heat loss models. Therefore, we also introduced additional sub-models for flux \r\ndissolution and heat loss calculations. The comprehensive model extends its predictive \r\ncapabilities to encompass decarburization, desiliconization, demanganization, and \r\ndephosphorization removal rates in impact (gas-metal) and emulsion (slag-metal-gas) zones \r\nunder real-world, full-scale operating conditions. Within the lime dissolution sub-model, the \r\ndissolution rate of flux is calculated, accounting for variations in slag viscosity, composition, and \r\ntemperature. This model\'s predictions for removing carbon, silicon, manganese, and phosphorus, \r\nas well as the temperature of the metal bath, agreed with actual observations from plant \r\noperations over the blowing process. The model is still progressing to incorporate other submodels like the scarp dissolution model. Therefore, the expanded model enhances its predictive \r\ncapacity by incorporating scrap dissolution dynamics. Analysis of the model\'s predictions reveals \r\na gradual melting of the scrap material within the initial phase (0-120 seconds), followed by a \r\nnotable acceleration in the subsequent stage (>120 seconds) attributed to the heightened \r\ntemperature of the liquid metal. Specifically, the scrap dissolution time was determined to be 510 \r\ns for a scrap radius of 0.25 m, 400 s for a radius of 0.18 m, and 300 s for a radius of 0.14 m. \r\nFurthermore, the model successfully forecasted that the metal bath temperatures were \r\nconsistently 60-85Â°C higher than the slag bath temperature during the middle part of the \r\nblowing; however, by the end of the blowing, it reverses, and the slag temperature is higher by \r\n40 to 60Â°C, demonstrating a remarkable agreement with the temperature measurements observed \r\nin the BOF converter.\r\nFinally, the model is a valuable tool for guiding plant operations, offering reasonable forecasts \r\nfor parameters such as carbon, silicon, manganese, and phosphorus removal rates, as well as slag \r\ncompositions and slag weights. The model includes sub-models for lime dissolution, scrap \r\ndissolution, and heat loss calculation. Scientifically, developing this comprehensive model for \r\nthe basic oxygen steelmaking process enhances our theoretical comprehension of the process. \r\nFurthermore, it offers the means to control the refining process when dealing with diverse raw \r\nmaterials and various operating conditions.','MME Office','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/tcw-xqkg-kan','','',1,'2024-05-10 05:34:18','Active'),(329,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','AS6999 Bioinspired fiber-reinforced polymer composites and their  mechanical properties  / AS7999 Three-point Bending, Interlaminar Shear, and Impact Strength in Bioinspired Helicoidal Basalt Fiber/Epoxy Composites: A Comparative  Experimental Analysis','Ms.Shreya Rai (AE20D405)','Ph D research Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','Dr.Prashant Rawat - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/05/10 15:00','2024-05-10','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/tzu-faya-jqg','','',1,'2024-05-10 05:45:12','Active'),(330,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','MKT1 allelic regulation of stress responses involves post-transcriptional modulation of Puf3 targets in budding yeast','Mr. Koppisetty Viswa Chaithanya (BT16D023)','Ph.D. Research Scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Dr Himanshu Sinha','Department of Biotechnology','2024/05/14 11:00','2024-05-14','','Google Meet','MKT1, a pleiotropic stress response gene identified by several quantitative trait studies, regulates HO endonuclease via the Pbp1-Pab1 complex post-transcriptionally. In addition, MKT1A89G polymorphism was identified to contribute differentially to stress resistance. MKT189G, as a causal variant, determined growth advantage in multiple environments and was hypothesised to regulate differential expression during stress conditions. RNA-binding protein Puf3 modulates a set of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial transcripts whose expression was found to be affected by the MKT1 alleles. This study attempted to correlate the MKT1 allele-derived growth advantage with the stability of Puf3 targets during stress and elucidated the roles of Pbp1 and Puf3 in this mechanism. We compared the mRNA decay kinetics of a set of Puf3 targets in multiple environments to understand the allele-specific regulation by MKT1. Our results indicated that variation in post-transcriptional regulation between MKT1 alleles caused this differential expression of Puf3 targets in a stress-specific manner. Additionally, MKT1 allelic interactions with Pbp1 and Puf3 were necessary to stabilise Puf3 targets, and this regulation was specific to the MKT189G background. Phenotypic analysis of these stress-specific Puf3 targets â€“ COX17, IVY1, and RDL2 showed that they selectively affect growth in MKT189G background in oxidative stress.

The rising concerns about pollution, caused by vehicular emissions, are being resolved by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). EVs are superior to internal combustion (IC) engine vehicles, which are fuelled by fossil fuels, in two important dimensions--fuel efficiency and exhaust emission. The heart of the EV is the energy storage system, and the popular choice is lithium-ion battery (LIB) due to high gravimetric energy density volumetric energy density, power density, good cyclability, high operating voltage, and low self-discharging compared to other rechargeable systems. EVs use different LIB variants that vary in LIB capacity, electrode and electrolyte raw material compositions, architecture, and form factors.  \r\nGovernment policy support (subsidies) for EV adoption, LIB manufacturing infrastructure, and raw material mining impacts LIB demand. However, gradual subsidy withdrawal, increasing pressure on geographical constraints, raw material supply chain complexity, and economic uncertainties due to increasing LIB demand inhibit LIB adoption. Additionally, geopolitical constraints, artisanal mining, limited manufacturing infrastructure, raw material price fluctuations, and the need for clarity in government policies impact the LIB demand. Supply pressure on raw material and LIB can be alleviated by adequately handling end-of-life (EOL) LIB that allows the recovery of raw material and the supply of repurposed LIB. \r\nThe above discussion points out that an in-depth understanding of the complexity of LIB demand is imperative to accelerate the electric mobility transition. Analysing the LIB demand variability and impact of EOL LIB handling processes requires a system-wide analysis rather than inspecting the individual components. The objective of this research is to develop a system dynamics model to understand the dynamics of LIB demand.  \r\nIn the first model, causal linkage among different subsystems of the LIB ecosystem, namely, raw material supply chain, manufacturing infrastructure, and EOL LIB management infrastructure and processes, is explored using system dynamics modelling. The model highlights the importance of government policies in analysing the LIB ecosystem. Government policy support helps in developing new raw material mines, battery R&D, LIB manufacturing, and EOL LIB handling process infrastructure. LIB demand depends on raw material mining, LIB cost, manufacturing infrastructure, EOL LIB handling process, LIB technological improvement, and different LIB variants demand. It is shown that LIB demand depends on interaction among multiple factors interlinked through multiloop feedback systems. We develop a system dynamics model to analyse the interrelationship between battery capacity (Battery OEMs), battery electrode composition (varies with different LIB variants), range anxiety (EV owners), subsidy (Government), and their effect on LIB cost (per kWh) and market demand. The results indicate that LIB cost per kWh attains the value between (99â€“135) USD/kWh in 2031-2032 depending upon the difference in scenarios. The results also highlight the trade-offs between the LIB cost and the LIB capacity while addressing the issue of range anxiety which helps battery product segmentation for consumers. LIB demand is substantially high in scenarios where higher subsidies are given on EV purchases in the initial phase and then gradually withdrawn during the simulation time frame. \r\nModel results also highlights that LIB variant demand variability impacts the EOL supply when LIB reaches EOL. Raw material demand and recovery depend on the LIB variants. System dynamics model is developed to address the complexity of the raw material recovery process by analysing the interrelationship between collection rate (government), LIB variant proportion in EOL LIB (consumer preference), and EOL LIB allocation to recycling and repurposing (Battery OEMs). Model results highlight recycling can reduce the demand for total raw material by 8-10%, reducing the virgin raw material for new batteries. Our analysis also reveals that a high EOL collection rate and recycling reduces the raw material (Nickel and Cobalt) demand by 2-17%. Hence, countries like India, with scarce strategic raw materials sources, framed policies that incentivized EOL LIB collection and recycling to alleviate raw materials scarcity.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadra','','',1,'2024-05-10 07:05:23','Active'),(332,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Physics-informed Neural Networks for Heterogeneous Poroelastic Media','Mr. Sumanta Kumar Roy, Roll No. CE22S003','M.S Research Scholar','Dr. Chandrasekhar Annavarapu - Guide, Dr. Benny Raphael - GTC Member, Dr. Sundararajan Natarajan (ME) - GTC Member, Dr. Robinson R G - Chairperson','Civil Engineering','2024/05/16 14:30','2024-05-16','yes','BSB 104 (Conference Room)','Subsurface systems are inherently complex, with intricate coupling among various physical processes, often necessitating computational modeling due to the impracticality or expense of direct measurements. Traditionally, these coupled processes are represented mathematically through partial differential equations (PDEs) which are solved using mesh-based numerical methods like the finite element method. However, these mesh-based numerical methods require the generation of meshes that conform with the geometrically complex subsurface features. This pre-processing step is often non-trivial and comparable in its computational expense with the analysis phase. Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative to address this computational bottleneck. These methods construct a neural network approximation to the field variables by minimizing an objective functional been built from the residual of the governing PDEs, boundary conditions, and/or observed data. Although PINNs have demonstrated promise in several domains, their applications to model poroelasticity in heterogeneous media are limited because of two fundamental challenges. Firstly, sharp changes in material properties result in weakly discontinuous solutions, and PINNs are not naturally good at approximating such functions. Secondly, poroelasticity involves the solution of a coupled system of PDEs. This study addresses both of these challenges by proposing two novel architectures of PINNs: â€œInterface-PINNsâ€ (I-PINNs) for approximating discontinuous fields and a â€œcomposite neural networkâ€ (CNN) to solve coupled-field processes. These architectures are combined to model poroelasticity in layered heterogeneous media. Several benchmark examples are used to compare the performance of the proposed approach with conventional PINNs. The results show that the proposed method is better suited for heterogeneous poroelasticity problems in terms of both accuracy and cost. \r\n\r\n','R.

It involves partitioning a medical image (2D or 3D) into distinct regions and delineating structures such as organs, tissues, or anomalies, which can be done manually, semi-automatically, or fully-automatically. The primary objective is to enhance the precision of medical image interpretation, aiding clinicians in treatment planning and decision-making processes. Although many segmentation networks have been proposed for 3D volumetric segmentation of tumors and organs, they fail to produce precise results. In case of errors generated by these networks, clinicians would have to edit the generated segmentation maps manually. \r\nThis demands a methodology that can deal with the complexities arising from segmentation errors in medical imaging and a robust network to estimate these errors. To this end, we propose a novel methodology designed to identify and quantify inaccuracies within the segmentation map of a given 3D volume. By employing this approach, we can pinpoint and measure erroneous regions within the segmentation map, offering a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, our method is capable of estimating errors at individual points or nodes within a 3D mesh generated from a potentially erroneous volumetric segmentation map. This approach serves as an effective Quality Assurance (QA) tool, enhancing the reliability and accuracy of segmentation outcomes in medical imaging applications.\r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/ecr-xgxx-bby ','','',1,'2024-05-10 10:11:07','Active'),(335,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Cryptographic applications of k-SUM','Akhil Vanukuri (CS22S023)','Research Scholar,','Dr. Jayalal Sarma M.N, Dr. Shweta Agrawal, Dr.Aishwarya T., Dr. Nishanth Chandran','Department of Computer Science & Engineering','2024/05/15 11:00','2024-05-15','','Seminar Hall - (SSB 334 - AM Turing Hall)','In the average-case k-SUM problem, given r integers chosen uniformly at random from {0, . . . , M âˆ’ 1}, the objective is to find a â€œsolutionâ€ set of k numbers that sum to 0 modulo M.

The overarching analysis juxtaposes regulatory impacts on established firms within the European Union against the developmental trajectories of climate tech startups in India, providing insights into how both macro-level policies and micro-level entrepreneurial activities influence sustainable business practices and financial outcomes.\r\n\r\nPart 1 of this study examines the impact of the EUâ€™s Corporate Social Responsibility mandate on listed European firms using a difference-in-differences regression model.

This underscores the need to consider industry-specific metrics in policymaking. Part 2 of the study studies 15 Indian climate tech startups through a multiple case study, focusing on their evolving business models and objectives. Initially, environmental goals are prominent, but as startups grow, financial objectives become dominant.

The idea behind introduction of cocktails of two different kind of materials is to enhance its optical properties by supporting electronic phenomenon. The integration of these two materials leverages the unique properties of each, resulting in enhanced performance and functionality. Metal oxide narrowband photodetectors in the visible region are in demand for different applications such as image sensors and bio-medical application. Earlier a metal oxide heterojunction consisting of zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium oxide (TiO2) was fabricated with squaraine dye (SQ2) on top of the device. The device shows a significantly low dark current (1.72 nA under 10 V bias) with a detectivity of 2.57 Ã—1010 Jones (under 1 V external bias). In this work, A narrowband red-sensitive negative photodetector is fabricated on a TiO2/SnO2 heterojunction by a solution-processed technique. The negative photoconductance of the device originates from the TiO2/SnO2heterojunction and is converted into a narrowband red-sensitive photodetector by coating it with an organic dye, absorbing predominantly in the red portion of the visible spectrum. However, this negative red-sensitive photoresponse of the device can be converted to a positive photoresponse in a reversible manner by passing hot dry air. The negative photoconductance effect in the TiO2/SnO2 heterostructure is found to be persistent, whereas the positive photoconductance effect is characterized by its transient nature, indicating that the adsorbed H2O molecule on TiO2 has a key role in this negative photoconductivity. The photodetector exhibits a responsivity of 1.19 A/W and a detectivity of 6.0 Ã— 1011 Jones to red-light illumination (650 nm, 12.5 W/17 m2) in positive photoconductance mode. Moreover, the nature of the photoresponse in positive and negative photoconductance behaviour is quite different, which helps to identify the origin of the negative photoconductance of the device.','Parasuraman Swaminathan','swamnthn@iitm.ac.in','Offline seminar.

Training systems ranging from simple abdominal models (box trainers) to highly realistic virtual reality (VR) systems are used to train laparoscopic skills. Force is crucial for learning psychomotor skills in laparoscopic tissue manipulation. However, many laparoscopic VR simulators lack force feedback and measure tissue damage solely through visual feedback based on virtual collisions. Few VR simulators that provide force feedback have subjective force metrics. The widely used laparoscopic training program known as fundamental laparoscopic surgery (FLS) only measures time and position accuracy. Hence, to provide haptic skills training and assessment, we have developed a VR laparoscopic training simulator with haptic feedback. Additionally, we extend the FLS-part tasks to haptic-based FLS (HFLS), focusing on controlled force exertion. The proposed tasks are evaluated through face and content validity among laparoscopic surgeons of varying experience levels. The results show that trainees perform better in HFLS tasks, indicating the acceptance of the simulator for its appearance and functionality. Face and content validations show the need to improve haptic realism, which is also observed in existing simulators. To enhance the accuracy of force rendering, we incorporate a laparoscopic tool force model into the simulation. We further investigate the model\'s effectiveness through a psychophysical study that measures just noticeable differences (JND) for the laparoscopic gripping task. Additionally, we also propose an assessment of other laparoscopic surgical skills using Fittsâ€™s law, a method for measuring the speed and precision of hand movements. We focus specifically on the ability to adapt to the inverted visual tool motion caused by the fulcrum effect. Further, we investigate the impact of haptic feedback on inverted laparoscopic tool motion.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline Meeting link : https://meet.google.com/xda-ntpx-tkq','','',1,'2024-05-13 04:28:12','Active'),(341,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Near-Field Neural Rendering Guided by Single-Shot Photometric Stereo (Application : 3D endoscopy)','Mr. Reddy Joshna Manoj (EE21S113)','MS Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. Kaushik Mitra','Electrical Engineering','2024/05/16 11:00','2024-05-16','yes','Online (Googlemeet)','We present a novel near-field neural rendering approach that combines single-shot RGB photometric stereo and Signed Distance Functions(SDF)-based Neural Rendering. Photometric stereo-based cues guide the neural rendering of 3D meshes. Recent studies have shown that SDF-based neural implicit surface reconstruction methods can produce smoother, more comprehensive 3D reconstructions. However, their performance tends to decline when capturing fine details in complex near-field images due to the ambiguity in RGB reconstruction loss. For instance, 3D endoscopy, characterized by near-field sparse views and complex surfaces, poses considerable challenges for existing volumetric SDF methods. Motivated by advancements in near-field photometric stereo, our work explores the utilization of these cues to enhance neural implicit surface reconstruction from diverse perspectives. To simplify the acquisition of photometric stereo images in endoscopy setups, we employ a strategy that involves single-shot RGB photometric stereo capture for each view. Utilizing a learning-based near-field photometric stereo network, we extract depth and normals for each view. These cues contribute to improved performance when dealing with very near-field natural objects as well as endoscopic scenes. We have extensively tested this approach on various rendered and real near-field datasets, and it consistently outperforms existing photometric NeRF techniques, especially when dealing with near-field multi-view visuals.\r\n\r\n Our approach simplifies the capture process while maintaining high-quality results, crucial for near-field objects requiring precise detail.In our experiments, We seamlessly capture multiple viewpoints of various near-field real-time objects using a mobile device.

The heat treated alloys were \r\ncharacterized in terms of difference of phase fraction, the extent of recovery, recrystallization \r\nand texture evolution. The effect of heat treatment parameters on the volume fraction and grain \r\nsize of primary Î± was more in bimodal microstructure than that of the equiaxed microstructure. \r\nThe width of transformed Î± laths increases with increasing soaking temperature. Additionally, \r\nthe extent of recovery and recrystallization of primary Î± was higher in equiaxed microstructure \r\nthan in bimodal microstructure. The higher solutionizing temperature caused the dislocations \r\nin primary Î± to arrange themselves into lower energy substructures, which ultimately lead to \r\nsub grain formation. In transformed Î± laths, dislocations were generated due to lattice strain \r\ninduced during Î² to Î± phase transformation. The rolling texture vanished gradually as the \r\nmicrostructure recovered and new recrystallized primary Î± grains grew. The newly formed \r\nrecrystallized primary Î± grains and the majority of transformed Î± showed a moderate and strong \r\nprismatic texture respectively.\r\nThe room temperature uniaxial tensile tests were conducted on all the microstructures. The \r\ndeformed specimens were characterized to elucidate the effect of various microstructural \r\nparameters on the tensile properties and to determine the deformation mechanism of the alloy. \r\nAmong three different microstructures, the equiaxed microstructure (Î±/Î²-900/950-FC) \r\nv\r\nexhibited a superior strength-toughness combination, while the lamellar microstructure (Î²1050-AC) displayed poor tensile properties. The bimodal microstructure (Î±/Î²-900/950-AC) \r\nshowed intermediate tensile properties. Recrystallized Î± grains and their connectivity promoted \r\nan extended steady-state flow during deformation and ductile fracture. The bimodal \r\nmicrostructure work hardened faster as compared to the other two microstructures. TEM \r\ninvestigation on the post-tested microstructures showed that events such as dislocation \r\nmultiplication and dislocation-dislocation interactions, formation of slip bands across the Î± \r\ngrains, and multiple slip and dislocation pile-ups contribute to hardening mechanisms during \r\ndeformation. Whereas slip transfer across Î±/Î± boundary and breaking of Î² laths are the events \r\nof softening mechanisms. The slip transfer across two adjacent Î± grains happens when the \r\nmisalignment between grains is less than 10Â°. Equiaxed microstructures exhibited maximum \r\nslip transfer due to interconnected primary Î± grains. Bimodal microstructures (Î±/Î²-900/950-\r\nAC) exhibited slip transfer when a higher fraction of interconnected primary Î± in the \r\nmicrostructure. In contrast, the lamellar microstructure showed no evidence of slip transfer. \r\nThe prism slip is the dominant active slip system in the equiaxed and bimodal microstructures. \r\nHowever, the lamellar microstructure with no primary Î± showed only the prismatic <c+a> and \r\npyramidal <a> slip activities.\r\nThe dynamic compression test at different temperatures (25, 300, and 450Â°C) and strain rates\r\n(10-3\r\n, 1, and 102\r\ns\r\n-1\r\n) were conducted for all three microstructures. The bimodal and lamellar \r\nmicrostructure have superior flow properties at higher temperatures and strain rates due to the \r\nabundance of Î±P / Î±T/Î² boundary and Î±T/Î² boundary. The severity of shear localization is higher \r\nin specimens tested at 300Â°C than those tested at 450Â°C due to higher thermal softening at \r\n450Â°C. A higher volume fraction of Î±T promotes prism <c+a> slip, whereas Î±P promotes prism \r\n<a> slip. Additionally, {1 0 1Ì… 0} slip is preferred over {1 1 2Ì… 0} slip at higher deformation \r\nvi\r\ntemperature and strain rates. Restricted grain rotation during deformation, because of due to the \r\ncolumnar morphology and imposed strain rate, has promoted pyramidal slip over prism slip. \r\nSever strain accumulation inside shear bands led to the formation of dislocations walls and \r\nlattice bending inside severely kinked lamellae and nano sub grains and dislocation networks \r\nand substructures inside elongated Î±P grains.\r\nAn in-depth investigation of shear bands and fracture surfaces led to very interesting outcomes. \r\nFormation of dendritic structure has been observed inside highly strained shear bands. \r\nFurthermore, the fracture surface of sheared samples exhibits spherical particles sticking to the \r\nsurface. Compositional analysis using EDS depicts these structures as close to the overall alloy \r\ncomposition with considerable solute segregation in spherical particles. The reason behind such \r\nobservation has been described as localized melting of the alloy due to a sudden burst of strain \r\nenergy during fracture and interface friction between delaminated grains.

We derive the probability distribution of the maximum expected benefit from exploring a design space. Given the potential advantages of conducting experiments, we address some associated challenges, including the impact of treatments, resources, and temporal variations. Extant literature proposes models that assume a standard multi-treatment framework for stationary experimental settings. The second study explores its inverse problem to model a non-standard online environment that fixes a single treatment and experiments in the space of heterogeneous resources. Maximizing the expected benefit from two phases -- one-shot exploration as the first phase followed by selective exploitation as the second phase -- we recommend the optimal allocation to each unique category of resources. The third study determines the effect of temporal variations on the treatments in a non-stationary online experiment. We assume a moving-window setup where choosing the better treatment among two alternatives at a particular time period depends only on the past few time periods. With continuous experimentation and exploitation of prior knowledge, maximization of the expected benefit leads to a steady state of resource allocation. We illustrate the applicability of the above studies with experimental data from the domain of financial technology and provide suggestions for implementation.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION.-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadr','','',1,'2024-05-13 10:52:53','Active'),(347,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','COMPUTATIONAL MODELLING AND ANALYSIS OF NONLINEAR VIBRATIONS OF SANDWICH PANELS','Ms.R.Sukanya (AE21D033)','PhD Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','Dr.K V Nagendra Gopal - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/05/15 15:00','2024-05-15','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/sgh-xpmg-uay','','',1,'2024-05-13 11:10:16','Active'),(348,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Diffusion and search in complex media - examples from biology','Mithun Kumar Mitra','IIT Bombay','Department of Physics\r\nIIT Bombay','Center for soft and biological matter','2024/05/14 15:00','2024-05-14','','HSB 209','Transport and search processes are often crucial in biological systems.

We will consider experimental data to situate our theoretical results in the context of the protein search problem.

Especially in Heavy Commercial Road Vehicles (HCRVs), the Government of India has taken steps to reduce road accidents by mandating Antilock Braking Systems (ABS). ABS is an AVSS that prevents wheels from getting locked during emergency braking and optimizes the braking force at the tire-road interface. However, during combined emergency braking and cornering, ABS alone may not ensure vehicle stability and may result in loss of directional stability. Hence, yaw rate control is necessary for critical cornering scenarios. This research evaluates an existing ABS algorithm in combined braking and cornering scenarios and presents the limitations of ABS in such situations. Further, it proposes a data-based reference yaw rate generator and rule-based yaw rate controller that modifies the reference value of the wheel slip given to the ABS. The integrated algorithm is evaluated on a hardware-in-loop setup with a brake actuator, which utilizes IPG TruckMaker to simulate vehicle dynamics. This research focuses on delivering a rule-based approach for yaw rate control that is commercially viable and can be the foundation for all use cases expecting directional stability and performance.

This shift marks a departure from reliance on human intelligence, as AI-driven approaches, especially deep learning algorithms, have proven to be highly effective in automatically localizing ships and tracking naval activities. In this context, a pioneering deep-learning-based algorithm has been developed specifically for ship localization in SAR images, addressing inherent complexities and computational demands. This algorithm integrates elements of traditional computer vision techniques with state-of-the-art deep neural networks, resulting in a robust framework for accurate ship localization. Moreover, a modified loss function has been introduced to optimize the model\'s performance, further enhancing its efficacy in detecting and localizing ships within SAR imagery. Comparative analysis of this novel algorithm against existing models has demonstrated significant improvements in both precision and recall metrics, showcasing its potential to substantially enhance coastal surveillance capabilities and bolster naval security efforts. The algorithm\'s ability to provide precise localization of ships in SAR images not only streamlines monitoring processes but also enables more proactive responses to potential maritime threats.\r\nBeyond ship localization, the study also delves into the realm of automatic maritime target classification using SAR data. By leveraging attention-guided convolutional neural network (CNN) models supplemented with handcrafted features, the research has achieved notable advancements in classification accuracy, particularly in low-resolution SAR images. This breakthrough holds immense promise for diverse maritime applications, including but not limited to vessel categorization (e.g., tankers, bulk carriers, container ships, fishing vessels), thereby contributing significantly to improved maritime domain awareness and operational efficiency. Furthermore, the study underscores the cost-effectiveness of utilizing SAR data for ship classification, especially when compared to high-resolution labeled SAR image data, which can be prohibitively expensive. This cost-efficient approach not only expands access to valuable maritime data but also paves the way for more comprehensive and accurate maritime surveillance systems, ultimately bolstering maritime security on a global scale.\r\n','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING ','oeoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-14 07:10:34','Active'),(354,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Modeling and analysis of ocean heat contents in spatial and depth domains using satellite data','Mr.Vijay Prakash Kondeti (OE20D750)','Mr.Vijay Prakash Kondeti (OE20D750), PhD scholar ','Prof. P.

In-situ ocean temperature profiles are critical to estimate OHC changes despite some uncertainties due to specific instrument biases, baseline climatology, and spatial data distribution irregularity (mapping method). Insufficient and irregular observational data limit our ability to create synoptic views of OHC change and its long-term trends based on sparse observations. This has resulted in numerous satellite-based approaches for detecting spatial and temporal patterns of global and regional OHC changes from multi-sensor observations. Several researchers have proposed satellite-based OHC models for open oceans based on the Oceanâ€™s thermal expansion method (OTEM). Though OTEM is the finest choice, their implementations had significant drawbacks due to the deviation from precise theoretical considerations. The current study has attempted to better implement OTEM to estimate OHC at 17 depth extents ranging from the surface to 700 m. Artificial neural network (ANN) models are proposed to derive thermosteric sea level (TSL) from a given sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, geographical coordinates, and climatological TSL dataset. The model-derived TSL data can be used to estimate OHC changes based on the thermal expansion efficiency of heat. On the other hand, challenges still exist in estimating OHC changes in ice-covered oceanic regions, mainly because of insufficient data and a lack of satellite-based algorithms. For this, separate ANN models are proposed for estimating OHC changes at the same multiple depths in the ice-covered Arctic Ocean by establishing a relationship between OHC and sea ice thermodynamic parameters such as sea ice thickness, sea ice concentration, surface temperature, air temperature, and snow depth. The proposed models are capable of understanding spatial patterns and temporal trends of OHC in three-dimensional ocean space at desired time scales to better study global climate change and its impacts on the Polar Oceans.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING ','oeoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-14 07:18:55','Active'),(355,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Seminar II - Air Pollution Hotspot Management using Image Processing and Machine Learning Techniques','Mr. Aswin Giri J, Roll No: CE19D039','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. S M Shiva Nagendra - Guide, Dr. Gitakrishnan Ramadurai - DC Member, Dr. Chandan Sarangi - DC Member, Dr. B S V Prasad Patnaik, AM - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/05/16 14:00','2024-05-16','yes','Visveswaraya Seminar Hall (BSB368) - Second Floor','Air pollution\'s sources and characteristics have become more complex in recent years, creating air pollution hotspots across the city.

LTB is associated with the formation of a tubercular granuloma that restricts the penetration of anti-TB drugs, including Rifampicin (RIF), to the infection site, thereby causing poor treatment outcomes. In this study, we developed Mtb-FTSZ-targeted silk fibroin nanoparticles that can penetrate the core of 3D granuloma and facilitate the antibacterial activity of RIF. A three-point dual-pharmacophore based in silico virtual screening and in vitro biochemical studies identified Piperine (PIP, IC50=21.2Â±0.7â€¯Î¼M), Bromo-dimethoxy coumarin and diethyl amino-methyl-coumarin as potent Mtb-FTSZ targeting agents. PIP was chosen as a suitable candidate ligand for  Mtb-FTSZ targeting due to its low cytotoxicity and potential synergistic antibacterial activity (MIC90=56.0 Â±4.3Î¼M). RIF-encapsulated silk fibroin nanoparticles (R-SFNs, 168Â±31nm) were synthesized by pH-mediated self-assembly. The R-SFNs exhibited an immunomodulatory effect on macrophages and demonstrated an enhanced intracellular antibacterial clearance in a 2D macrophage infection model. These R-SFNs were functionalized with PIP (P-R-SFNs), and the intragranuloma trafficking of P-R-SFNs was studied using an in-house developed human iPSCs derived 3D in vitro granuloma model. It was observed that the P-SFNs exhibit enhanced granuloma penetration kinetics with two-fold higher accumulation within the granuloma spheroids than the naÃ¯ve SFNs. Notably, the P-SFNs could penetrate the caseous core of TB granuloma, while the naÃ¯ve SFNs were retained at the periphery. Further mechanistic studies revealed that PIP functionalization improved the membrane fluidity of macrophages, thereby enabling improved penetration of P-R-SFNs. Thus, the study culminates Mtb-FTSZ targeting and passive permeability potentiation of piperine, combined with the good aerodynamic, immunomodulatory, and mucoadhesive nature of SFNs, can be a potential drug delivery system for treating granuloma-associated tuberculosis.\r\nPublications from the thesis:\r\n1.

Depending on aneurysm size, shape and location they need to be managed either through clipping or an endovascular coiling intervention.  Due to the inherent advantages, endovascular coiling (EVC) is emerging as the treatment of choice for intracranial aneurysms (IAs). When coiled, reduced hemodynamic activity enables the coil to get thrombosed and achieve flow stasis. However, aneurysm recurrence and rupture after the treatment, due to improper coiling are issues of concern. Present study investigates the role of coil fill volume and packing density on the aneurysm for patient-specific conditions. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are employed with porous medium approximation to study the embolic coil filled aneurysm.

Depending on aneurysm size, shape and location they need to be managed either through clipping or an endovascular coiling intervention. Due to the inherent advantages, endovascular coiling (EVC) is emerging as the treatment of choice for intracranial aneurysms (IAs). When coiled, reduced hemodynamic activity enables the coil to get thrombosed and achieve flow stasis. However, aneurysm recurrence and rupture after the treatment, due to improper coiling are issues of concern. Present study investigates the role of coil fill volume and packing density on the aneurysm for patient-specific conditions. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are employed with porous medium approximation to study the embolic coil filled aneurysm.

This pursuit faces a significant hurdle: maintaining diffraction-limited beam quality amidst thermal fluctuations and optical non-linearities in the gain medium, particularly when targeting power levels in the order of 100 kWs from a single emitter. Coherent Beam Combining (CBC) emerges as a transformative solution, offering a pathway to enhance output power efficiency while preserving beam quality. Unlike conventional incoherent beam combining, which linearly scales beam intensities, CBC leverages the intricate combination of beam fields, resulting in a remarkable quadratic scaling of intensity with the number of beams.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of CBC\'s effectiveness lies the challenge of implementing active phase control. The coherent combination of the optical beams is fraught with perturbations from various factors, impeding their ability to coherently interfere and compromising combining efficiency. Dynamic phase control emerges as a crucial strategy, enabling real-time compensation for phase fluctuations and thereby enhancing combining efficiency. The seminar initially delves into modeling and simulation of phase control using conventional Stochastic Parallel Gradient Descent (SPGD) for a Tiled Aperture CBC system. It further develops an adaptive SPGD version, showcasing improved performance with increasing channel numbers. Subsequently, practical implementations of these algorithms within an experimental setup provide valuable insights into real-world performance and applicability. Lastly, the thesis explores Reinforcement Learning (RL) as an alternative to SPGD for phase control optimization, aiming to address challenges of phase noise, scalability, and efficiency in CBC systems and foster more robust and adaptable control strategies. \r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/nsd-mmnv-uxa','','',1,'2024-05-14 10:58:31','Active'),(363,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION OF AUDIO-VISUAL STIMULI INDUCED AROUSAL AND VALENCE EMOTIONAL STATES USING EEG SIGNAL','Mr. Himanshu Kumar (AM18D027)','Ph.D Scholar, Dept.of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering','Guide: Prof. S.

Analyzing emotional states aids in diagnosing mental health disorders effectively. Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a prominent physiological signal for this purpose, measuring brain activity non-invasively. However, extracting reliable information from EEG signals during evoked emotions, particularly using audio-visual stimuli, presents challenges. The convergence of multiple sensory inputs introduces nonlinearity and nonstationarity in signal characteristics. Moreover, existing automated classification methods lack transparency and may not be fully comprehensible. The aim of this research is to characterize arousal and valence emotional states using EEG signals. The discrete channel and functional connectivity of EEG signals under evoked emotional states are analyzed using linear and non-linear signal processing techniques. The arousal and valence emotional states are classified using glass box models. Moreover, this research also investigates impulsivity assessment, identifying EEG electrodes that predict impulsiveness levels using explainable machine learning.

This observation is generally attributed to the transient effects associated with stress relaxation phenomenon that occurs during the dwelling period. Therefore, accurate prediction of the time dependent mechanical behaviour during relaxation is important to model interrupted deformation processes. Although there have been several attempts to model relaxation, physically based constitutive formulations that can account for the deformation mechanism are scarce in the literature. So in this work, a modified version of the Kocksâ€“Meckingâ€“Estrin (KME) dislocation density based model is used to evaluate the substructural changes during relaxation. The model is implemented in the commercial finite element software ABAQUS through user material (UMAT) subroutine. Iso-error maps are generated to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical integration algorithm used. Simulations of interrupted uniaxial tensile tests for an aluminium alloy under two different material conditions are carried out to validate the model against experimental results. The implemented model is shown to closely capture the drop in stress and account for changes in dislocation density during relaxation. Subsequently, the model is applied to simulate interrupted hole expansion tests (HET). Through suitable conjectures, the effect of relaxation on the improvement in the hole expansion ratio is demonstrated.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/uai-jvvw-qus','','',1,'2024-05-14 14:32:18','Active'),(365,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','\'\'MULTI-OBJECTIVE VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEM WITH TIME WINDOWS (LARGE SCALE IMPLEMENTATION) \'\'.','K.

Many e-commerce companies has their main focus in routing vehicles as it forms the core problem to crack in their business models. As customers widely shift towards the e-commerce platforms, the need to solve the problem on a larger scale is also required. Every company has their own business model with different objectives. Companies like bbnow, zepto, swiggy, zomato etc., service the customers as soon as possible whereas companies like big basket have a specific slot for each delivery and companies like flipkart and amazon deliver the goods anytime within a specific day. Each company have their own routing model where they concentrate on a specific objective like delivering the goods to the customer on time or reducing the operational cost etc. In a real-time scenario it is essential to consider different objectives like cost, distance, customer satisfaction etc. Hence solving a problem with multiple objectives becomes essential. Among many objectives, customer satisfaction plays a significant role in a companyâ€™s success thus delivering the goods on time becomes one of the major objectives to be concentrated. This motivates our work where we deal with Multi Objective VRP with Time Windows. \r\nIn study 1, we frame a model to solve Multi-Objective Single Depot Vehicle Routing Problem with semi-soft time windows (MO-SDVRPSSTW) using a lexicographic approach. The primary objective of the problem is to minimize the number of customer orders that are tardy and use series of other objectives viz., the total distance travelled, the total tardiness and number of vehicles with their waiting times to bring in business context to solve very large problems. A mathematical formulation of the problem is presented, and an efficient Lexicographic Variable Neighborhood Search Algorithm (LVNSA) has been developed that iteratively uses the objectives in a lexicographic manner to generate good and better solutions on smaller benchmark problems and very large instances with 10000s of customers from real-life case data. A comparative evaluation from a practical sense is demonstrated with business implications.\r\nIn study 2, we present a Multi-Objective Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problems with Hard Time Windows (MO-MDVRPHTW) with the objective of minimizing the total distance and total number of vehicles for very large-scale data sets reflecting real-life applications. The proposed approach uses a decomposition-based framework that involves grouping of customers, initializing routing definitions using the sweep algorithm and generating better improvements on the routing sequences using Very Large-Scale Neighborhood (VLSN) search algorithm. The performance of the algorithm has been tested on 20 benchmark problems for Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows (MDVRPTW). Subsequently further experiments have been designed to generate very large-scale data sets to evaluate the scalability and the performance as well as robustness of the solutions using travel time uncertainty.\r\nIn certain real-life applications, there exists a restriction on the duration of the vehicle in a particular day. In this study we also analyze the impact on the quality of the solution including and excluding the maximum route duration limit for vehicles.\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS	Vehicle Routing, Soft Time Window, Hard Time Window, Multi-Objective, Large Neighborhood Search\r\n\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','MS SEMINAR-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadras/j.php?MTID=mf02','','',1,'2024-05-15 04:03:01','Active'),(366,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','â€œDEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A FRAMEWORK TO DETERMINE THE DIMENSIONS OF SOCIAL TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINSâ€.','Ms. PREETHI .R, Roll no.

Despite the three pillars of sustainability â€“ environmental, social, and economic- the limited and scattered analysis is on the social part, and the least is on socially responsible supply chain management (SR-SCM). SCT plays a significant role in elevating the sustainability of the supply chain. This study emphasizes the integration of SCT and sustainable supply chain, especially the social aspect as SR-SCM, and coining the new term social transparency (ST). This study establishes a conceptual framework using three research methods: systematic literature review, content analysis-based literature review, and framework development. The framework proposes five dimensions: tracking and tracing suppliers till provenance, product and process specifications, financial transaction information, social sustainability policies and compliance, and performance assessment to determine ST in global supply chains. \r\n\r\nWe further provide empirical evidence from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders across industries in the supply chain and validate the determinants. The ultimate goal is to build a robust research framework that will be crucial in evaluating social transparency, thereby contributing significantly to supply chain management and sustainability. This analysis reveals a fascinating diversity of perspectives among stakeholders (manufacturers, suppliers, social auditors, and consumers) across the supply chain. They perceive the necessity of social transparency and sustainability differently across industries such as food, textile, leather, and automotive.\r\n\r\n\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','SEMINAR - II (RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM)-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-i','','',1,'2024-05-15 04:15:00','Active'),(367,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','2D VSe2 thin films and VSe2/MX2 heterostructures','Ms. VIKASMITA SAMANTA, (PH21D006)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide: Dr. Sudakar Chandran','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/05/24 15:00','2024-05-24','yes','HSB-210, S N BOSE HALL, Department of Physics ','Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted significant research attention in various applications, viz. electronics, spintronics, memory devices and energy-related fields.

However, discrepancies in the FM nature [4] and suppression of CDW ordering at reduced dimensionality [1] motivate further exploration. Also, synthesizing continuous large-area 2D VSe2 thin films has been challenging. Furthermore, the heterostructures of VSe2 need to be explored to tailor and control the physical properties [5]. In this talk, I will give a comprehensive review on VSe2 thin films and its properties. Heterostructures derived from VSe2 thin films will also be discussed. Subsequently, I will present preliminary work that I have conducted on VSe2 thin films grown by CVD process.

Experiments are conducted using a scaled KCS model (1:75.5) in head sea conditions at zero speed. The collected experimental results are used to validate an in-house developed simulation tool named Hydrodynamics Response Analysis (HydRA).

Traditional water treatment methods often fall short in addressing refractory organic pollutants, necessitating the exploration of alternative approaches. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as non-thermal plasma (NTP) technology, have emerged as promising solutions due to their efficiency and environmental friendliness. However, energy inefficiencies in NTP systems have been a concern, prompting the integration of catalysts to enhance performance. Sulfate radical-based (SO4âˆ’) AOPs have gained traction for their superior oxidation potential and longer half-life compared to hydroxyl radicals (OH). Persulfate (PS) activation in water generates SO4âˆ’ and OH radicals, which exhibit high stability and broad pH applicability. Plasma treatment of PS can efficiently activate it, yielding both SO4âˆ’ and OH radicals simultaneously. Additionally, carbonaceous materials like biochar serve as catalysts for PS activation and adsorbents for pollutant removal, offering economic and practical advantages over nano-carbons. Despite its abundance, pristine biochar\'s catalytic performance is limited. Plasma treatment presents a promising avenue to enhance biochar\'s catalytic activity by controlling its surface oxygen-containing functional groups and structural defects. In this study, plasma treatment effectively regulated the active sites on the surface of carbon materials derived from single-use plastic waste, improving their physicochemical properties. The altered carbon structure and increased C=O functionalities facilitated electron transfer to persulfate (PMS), leading to PMS decomposition and dye degradation. Moreover, plasma treatment facilitated the efficient regeneration of carbon catalysts within the system. By precisely controlling the active sites of carbon catalysts and synergistically activating PMS, this work offers an effective method for utilizing waste-derived carbon materials in water purification processes. This approach holds promise for addressing water pollution challenges while valorizing plastic waste into valuable resources.c','G Mathangi','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-16 06:50:05','Active'),(377,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Seminar II - Removal of Nitrate and Other Oxyanions from Water and Wastewater using Ion Exchange Membrane Bioreactor','Mr. Akula Vishnu Vardhan, Roll No.CE18D202','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. Ligy Philip - Guide, Dr. BS Murty - DC Member, Dr. Venkatraman Srinivasan - DC Member, Dr. Raghuram Chetty (CH)- DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE','Civil Engineering','2024/05/27 10:00','2024-05-27','yes','BSB 104 Conference  Room','Water bodies worldwide are increasingly compromised by a variety of pollutants, which not only make the water unfit for human consumption but also pose significant ecological threats. Oxyanions like perchlorate and chromate are harmful at trace levels, while nitrates have variable toxicity. Excess nutrients from runoff and waste foster harmful algal blooms, causing ecological disruption. In our research, we explored the removal of nitrates from secondary effluent using an Ion Exchange Membrane Bioreactor (IEMB). This process not only facilitated nitrate removal but also enabled the concurrent removal and accumulation of phosphates via Donnan dialysis within the IEMB. This seminar will focus on the subsequent conversion of the accumulated phosphorus into vivianite. We conducted batch studies to examine the effects of various parameters on this conversion, including pH, Fe/P ratio, dissolved oxygen (DO), alkalinity, chlorides, and sulphates. Additionally, we investigated the removal of phosphorus from the accumulated receiver stream. To optimize the conversion process, we employed Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to fine-tune parameters such as pH, Fe/P ratio, and DO using real water samples. Our findings indicated that pH and Fe/P ratio significantly influenced phosphorus removal as vivianite (p<0.01), whereas DO did not have a significant impact (p>0.05). The optimal conditions for phosphorus removal were determined to be a pH of 8.5, an Fe/P ratio of 2.5, and a DO level of 1 mg/L, achieving a phosphorus removal efficiency of 98.47%. The resulting vivianite was characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). Further investigations included studying the simultaneous bacterial degradation of chromium along with nitrate and perchlorate. Continuous studies in a fixed bed bioreactor acclimatized for mixed pollutants resulted in removal of greater than 90% for all the three pollutants when operated with an HRT of 3h and glycerol as the carbon source.

The primary challenge with green hydrogen production is addressed in this work by exploring Bismuth-based 2D Janus materials (BiXY) as a potential electrocatalyst. Due to the broken inversion symmetry, these systems provide a unique electronic structure with a lack of spin-degeneracy, known as Rashba splitting. Utilising density functional theory with spin-orbit coupling and high-throughput computation to automate the workflow, a broad scan of possible compositions of halogens, chalcogenides, pnictogens and early transition metals in hexagonal and tetragonal phases was performed. This revealed correlations between properties such as formation energy, Rashba splitting coefficient, hydrogen adsorption, and others, which can aid in setting future directions. Further, a potential candidate for electrocatalysis, \"2D BiSF in Hexagonal phase\", was identified based on stability, number of active sites and Gibbs adsorption energy of hydrogen ion. With the application of strain, this system was optimised to reveal a near-zero Gibbs adsorption energy for a hydrogen ion (achieving 0.08 eV and -0.05 eV with the bi-axial tensile strain of 3% and 4%, respectively). These findings suggest that strained 2D BiSF is a promising candidate for efficient hydrogen production. Additionally, correlations between properties such as Rashba splitting, water splitting, band gaps, strain effect and work function pave the way for further optimisation.','MME Office','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-16 09:17:28','Active'),(379,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\"MATERIALS FOR ARSENIC AND FLUORIDE: A STUDY OF AFFORDABLE AND SUSTAINABLE NANOCOMPOSITES FOR CLEAN WATER\"','Mr. Anil Kumar A(CY17D067)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Pradeep T, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/05/27 11:00','2024-05-27','yes','Online-Google Meet','','CY OFFICE','cyoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','ALL ARE WELCOME-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/dmn-xwtk-yoj','','',1,'2024-05-16 09:19:36','Active'),(380,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','The influence of heat treatment on mechanical, corrosion and wear properties of  AM Ti-6Al-4V alloy processed by laser-based powder-bed fusion technique.

Ti-6Al-4V is a dual phase alloy that is widely used for biomedical implants because of its exceptional qualities, which include low density, specific strength, biocompatibility, and corrosion resistance. A high energy laser is used in the AM LPBF process, and layer-wise melting creates a fast thermal cycle with steep heating and cooling rates, giving titanium alloys a metastable microstructure. The as-built Ti-6Al-4V alloy consists of martensite (Î±â€²) which possesses a poor ductility. The post-heat treatment is thought to achieve a trade-off between strength and ductility by converting the metastable microstructure into a thermodynamically stable microstructure.  \r\nThe present work involves the selection of heat treatment temperature in the Î± + Î² field of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy (3 levels of temperature: 750 áµ’C, 850 áµ’C, 950 áµ’C). The current research investigates the influence of post heat treatment on Ti-6Al-4V alloy processed using L-PBF on mechanical, corrosion and wear properties. Furthermore, the evolution of various phases during annealing is also studied. The understanding of phase transformation and structure-properties relationship (mechanical, corrosion and wear properties) is thoroughly analysed using various characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD), and atom Probe Tomography (APT).    \r\nThe as-built condition consists of a hierarchical pattern of Î±â€² with localization of Î²-phase stabilising elements such as V and Si. The Î±â€² decomposes occurs via rejection of V and Si solutes forming Î²-phase and the simultaneous accumulation of Al forming the Î±-phase. The defective sites (dislocations and grain boundaries) act as a potential nucleation site for Î²-phase during subsequent annealing. Therefore, the stable Î±- and Î²-phases forms on annealing and a complete transformation is achieved above 850 áµ’C. Various microstructural changes were observed during annealing such as morphology (size, shape and distribution), phase fraction and chemical composition, which have more impact on resulting properties. The as-built shows the highest tensile strength of above 1200 MPa and ~8% elongation to fracture and the ductility improves on post annealing to about ~60%. From a corrosion point of view, the as-built possess a very inferior corrosion resistance attributing to the aggressive dissolution tendency of Î±â€², and corrosion resistance was decreased by more than 50% following annealing. The wear resistance of as-built was a little lower compared to annealed ones. The annealed samples exhibit reduced wear volume. Based on the evaluation, the optimal properties were obtained (in terms of microstructure, mechanical, corrosion and wear properties), it can be suggested that the heat treatment of AM Ti-6Al-4 V alloy in the range of around 850 áµ’C gives an optimal combination of strength and ductility, good corrosion and wear resistance, which can be which are highly recommended for biomedical implants.      \r\n \r\nKeywords: Ti-6Al-4V; Heat treatment; Microstructure, Mechanical, Corrosion and Wear properties.

These superalloys, vital for high-temperature applications, are susceptible to creep, fatigue, and creep-fatigue interaction loading due to their operational conditions, which limit their lifespan. These materials face creep loading caused by high temperatures and persistent mechanical loading due to centrifugal forces from rotating turbines and forces generated by highly pressurized combusted fluid. Repeated loading during aircraft takeoff and landing makes materials prone to low- cycle fatigue. Creep-fatigue interaction accelerates material failure, facilitated by void formation at grain boundaries due to creep and fatigue cracks present on surfaces. Existing empirical and phenomenological material models lack the ability to provide physical insights into loaded material and have limited predictive capabilities when used outside of calibrated loading scenarios. To investigate the phenomenon of creep and creep-fatigue interaction, this thesis introduces a physics-based constitutive modelling approach by incorporating Unified Mechanics Theory (UMT) to form the theoretical foundation. UMT represents an ab initio level unification of the second law of Newton and the second law of thermodynamics, which introduces thermodynamic state index (TSI), an entropy-based damage parameter. Onset of failure is defined by the critical value of TSI, which is not based on a user-defined failure strain but on the failure entropy.\r\nDeveloped UMT-based micromechanical model for creep in Nickel-based superalloys can capture secondary as well as tertiary creep regions and disregards primary creep as it has a negligible contribution to the material studied. This model accounts for dislocation motion activities (i.e., generation, annihilation and trapping), which is a potential source for energy dissipation at microlevel and corresponding entropy generation during creep. This analytical model was extended to three dimensions numerically by writing a user subroutine CREEP algorithm to solve initial boundary value problem. This algorithm was integrated with finite element solver ABAQUS to analyze the ASTM-E139-11 creep specimen multiaxially. Analytical predictions for uniaxial direction obtained from dislocation-based creep model and numerical predictions generated by implementing this creep model in three dimensions were compared against test data. A good match (RMSE 0.5%) with experimental data demonstrates the efficacy of micro-mechanical model across different stress levels and a single temperature. Additionally, constitutive modelling for creep-fatigue interaction was studied. Stress relaxation (observed during hold time) and fatigue are sequential phenomena, which together constitute a strain- controlled creep-fatigue interaction cycle. Two constitutive models were proposed for stress relaxation: a modified viscoelastic model and an exponential-based model. An UMT-based fatigue model proposed by Aman et al. (2021) was modified and used to model fatigue part of strain-controlled creep-fatigue loading. An algorithm was proposed to simulate hysteresis loops during strain-controlled creep-fatigue interaction loading by sequentially considering stress relaxation and fatigue. The entropy generated by these two loadings is combined using the framework of UMT to predict the total damage in the material due to creep-fatigue cycle. This constitutive model has the potential to predict the lifespan of Nickel-based superalloys subject to creep-fatigue loading. The thesis efficiently incorporates UMT and develops physics-based constitutive models for creep and creep-fatigue interaction in Nickel-based superalloys, which is regarded as a more scientific method than simply fitting curves.\r\n','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline meeting link: https://meet.google.com/yqd-yjfs-ejf','','',1,'2024-05-16 11:55:48','Active'),(382,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Studies on p21 activated kinase (Pak1) induced therapeutic resistance in pre-clinical models of Glioblastoma.','Mr. Satheesh Kumar.

It is incurable with a median survival of only 14-15 months with the standard of care of maximal surgery followed by concurrent chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy. Another challenge is, GBM eventually develops resistance to chemoradiation which necessitates the need to develop new strategies in tackling this disease. One of the common reasons for GBM developing chemo-radioresistance is evasion of apoptosis by signaling molecules, which derail the normal apoptosis signaling causing treatment resistance. p21-activated kinase (Pak1), a serine-threonine kinase, was found to be upregulated in GBM and promotes tumor progression via diverse signalling pathways. It has been shown to be involved in regulation of apoptosis or programmed cell death. Therefore, targeting Pak1 might prove to be potential target to overcome chemo-radioresistance and improve therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we focussed on developing pre-clinical models of Glioblastoma to study the role of Pak1 signaling in causing chemo-radioresistance in GBM. Results from in vitro studies on Pak1 Wt and Pak1 knock-out GBM cell line models showed decreased tumorigenic phenotype with induction of cell death in Pak1 knock-out cells.

They are heavily fine-tuned and aligned using large quantities of human preference data, usually elicited using pairwise comparisons. While aligning an AI/ML model to human preferences or values, it is worthwhile to ask whose preference and values we are aligning it to? The current approaches of alignment are severely limited due to their inherent uniformity assumption and the need for plurality , i.e., capturing the diversity in human preferences and values â€“ is getting recognized as an important challenge to address in this arena. There is also rich literature on learning preferences from human judgements using comparison queries. It plays a crucial role in several applications ranging from cognitive and behavioral psychology, crowdsourcing democracy, surveys in social science applications, and recommendation systems. However, the models in this literature often focus on learning average preference over the population due to the limitations on the amount of data available per individual or on learning an individual\'s preference using a lot of queries.

The experiments reveal significant HCCI engine load range variability across different biodiesel fuels. Strategies such as reducing the compression ratio and charge dilution are explored to extend the HCCI engine\'s operational range. The results show that fuel reactivity, engine load, compression ratio, and charge dilution influence HCCI combustion stability. This complex phenomenon necessitates the requirement of a predictive tool to classify the prevailing HCCI combustion regime at a given engine load for biodiesel fuels derived from diverse sources. Further, predicting the HCCI engine performance and emissions for various biodiesel fuels would help suggest the most suitable feedstock for producing biodiesel for HCCI engine applications. Experimental methods are impractical owing to the complexity of controlling multiple variables. Thus, the main objective of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of various machine learning algorithms in predicting the combustion regime, operational load limits and performance and emission characteristics of a light-duty HCCI engine fueled with neat biodiesels derived from various sources. The model developed using the decision tree classifier outperforms Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and k-Nearest Neighborhood models by classifying 94% of the samples, emerging as the best approach for classifying the combustion regimes.

The Drucker-Prager (D-P) model is appropriate for predicting the\r\nmacroscopic thermomechanical behaviour of granular pebbles. We developed a numerical\r\nframework to estimate these model parameters using the Discrete Element Method (DEM).\r\nThese model parameters controlled the shape and size of the initial yield envelope. The\r\ndiscrete element method (DEM) was used to perform triaxial compression simulations to\r\nextract these model parameters, which can then describe the constitutive relationship of a\r\nhomogenized finite element model of pebble beds. Current work focuses on investigating the\r\ngranular behaviour of pebble beds by analyzing the DP model parameters extracted from\r\npolydisperse pebbles. Hence, we have analyzed five numerical samples comprising particle size\r\ndistribution (PSD) with a mean diameter of 1 mm and a Gaussian distribution of pebble size\r\nranging from 0.1 mm to 1.9 mm. The primary objective is to understand the effect of PSD on\r\nthe system\'s granular response.\r\nOne of the critical DP parameters is the mesoscale friction angle, which is estimated by plotting\r\nthe point of failure in the meridional plane. Friction angle is a measure of granular strength and\r\nis defined as the angle between the failure surface and the hydrostatic axis in the pressuredeviatoric stress (p-q) plane. Another parameter is the dilatancy angle, extracted from the\r\ntriaxial compression simulation data and related to the dilatant behaviour of the initial\r\nhydrostatic compressed sample. Results show that the effect of polydispersity on friction angle\r\nis weak, but it increases as the packing fraction increases. It converges to almost a constant of\r\n29Â°for lower packing fractions (60.50% for the present work) and 31Â°for higher values of\r\npacking fractions. Similarly, the dilation angle decreases as the sample\'s polydispersity\r\nincreases, indicating that highly polydisperse samples are more prone to dilation. Significant\r\nvariations in the difference between friction angle and dilatancy with increasing polydispersity\r\nwere observed. Therefore, the associative flow rule is unsuitable for highly polydisperse\r\nsystems due to their susceptibility to dilatancy. Further detailed analysis of the mesoscopic\r\nmechanics was conducted by examining three parameters based on the mean number of\r\ncontacts, which governed the microstructural similarity of the sample and the extent of particle\r\nparticipation. Also, two local parameters based on Voronoi tesselation were investigated. These\r\nparameters highlight how changing polydispersity influences the local deformation and\r\ncharacterizes local structural variation in the granular samples. In particular, it was found that\r\nthe participation of particles in the total deformation was higher in samples with high\r\npolydispersity','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-17 12:12:32','Active'),(390,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL',' A study on shear wave propagation in a viscoelastic material','Mr. Vijay Hajare, ME21S030','MS Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide: Prof. Parag Ravindran-ME\r\nCo-guide: Prof. Prabhu Rajagopal-ME\r\nGTC members: Prof. Sujatha Srinivasan-ME (chair person), Prof. Shamit Bakshi-ME, Prof. Sumesh P Thampi-CH','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/05/23 15:00','2024-05-23','yes','Through Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/ahc-prfj-jpp','Modelling wave propagation through viscoelastic materials is challenging because of\r\nthe dissipation of energy typical of deformations in them.

The use of NURBS offers several advantages, such as smooth surface modeling, localized support, high precision, and computational efficiency. This study conducts a comparative analysis of incorporating IGA into boundary variation methods for topology optimization, with a specific focus on implementing reaction-diffusion and Allen-Cahn update equations for level set and phase field methods, respectively, marking a novel contribution to the literature. The impact of various parameters, such as basis function order, diffusion coefficients, and mesh size, on three standard benchmark topology optimization problems, is examined, demonstrating that quadratic NURBS basis functions effectively address compliance minimization and inverter mechanism problems in topology optimization. Additionally, a multi-material topology optimization problem is formulated by extending the reaction-diffusion equation (RDE)-based topology optimization using the level set method for a single material. This extended framework employs a blended formulation within each level set function to represent different materials, enabling the representation of ð¾ materials along with one void phase, resulting in ð¾ + 1 phases in total. The formulation effectively prevents phase overlap, ensuring that each point in the domain corresponds to a single phase, and offers precise control over geometrical complexities through ð¾-level set functions. The reaction-diffusion equation is used to evolve the level set function and update design variables, eliminating the need for reinitialization. This streamlined process is enhanced by using the same NURBS basis function to approximate state variables, geometry, and the level set function, facilitating seamless coupling between all components.\r\n\r\nThis study holds valuable insights for newcomers interested in using isogeometric analysis within boundary variation methods for topology optimization.

Identifying and characterizing the mycobacterial components that contribute to the infection process, forms an important step in deciphering the molecular basis of pathogenesis in tuberculosis. In this context, we are interested in functional characterization of protein Rv1987 from M.tb in bacterial physiology and host immuno-modulation. It is intriguing that M.tb, which exclusively infects humans, harbours this gene Rv1987 annotated as probable chitinase. The gene is widely distributed among members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) which infect non-chitin containing hosts. However, function of the protein is unknown. In the current study, we cloned and purified the protein Rv1987, performed biochemical studies which showed that it behaves as a carbohydrate-binding protein (CBP) with no enzymatic activity in contrary to its current annotation. Computational studies to gain insights into the function and substrate specificity of Rv1987 revealed it structurally matches with chitin/cellulose binding domains of chitinases from other bacteria. To study the role of Rv1987 in bacterial physiology, recombinant strains of M. smegmatis (M.s) overexpressing the protein were generated. Phenotypic traits, response to abiotic stress factors between the strains were evaluated. Cyto-adhesion and intracellular survival assays showed that Rv1987:M.s exhibited enhanced survival. Rv1987 also did not trigger the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 indicating that protein drives the cells towards the anti-inflammatory pathway. Our study indicates that Rv1987, acts as a CBP that induces apoptosis and promotes bacterial survival.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/rxp-hoaq-xmf','','',1,'2024-05-20 05:08:50','Active'),(395,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Experimental Investigations of Desiccant Coated Dew-Point Evaporative Cooling Systems ','Mr.  Pranav Kumar Iyer (ME20D034)','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide Name: Dr. M.P.

This is followed by an explanation of the experimental setup and the procedures used to undertake experimental trials of the three stages: DD stage, regeneration stage and cooling stage. Finally, an analysis of the experimental results is provided. \r\nThe transient analysis reveals that the experimental results follow a similar trend to the numerical simulations. The analysis also shows the limitations of the existing fabrication procedures, which lead to a reduced system performance compared to the numerical simulations. Subsequently, an analysis of the operational time and downtimes of the system showcases the possibility of doubling the cooling capacity at higher values of regeneration temperatures and branching ratios. The parametric studies and performance analysis also revealed that the experimental results followed the same trend as the numerical simulations for varying inlet and system conditions.

The microstructure of low alloy steel primarily consists of the ferrite phase, which is susceptible to corrosion and hydrogen damage in harsh environments. The presence of residual or applied stress on the components, along with an aggressive environment during service conditions, would lead to premature failure. Hence, it is not only important to study the corrosion and hydrogen interaction behavior of ferritic steels, but also to understand the effect of mechanical load on them. Further, identifying an appropriate surface modification method and understanding the performance is paramount.\r\nTherefore, this study aims to understand the effect of mechanical deformation on the corrosion and hydrogen permeation behavior of low alloy steel by performing in-situ mechano-electrochemical experiments. Also, the cathodic plasma electrolytic nitriding (c-PEN) technique is used to modify the low alloy (2.25Cr-1Mo) ferritic steel surface. The results of in-situ corrosion experiments revealed that the applied plastic deformation did not significantly influence the corrosion kinetics of the steel. Additionally, the hydrogen permeation results showed that the plastically deformed specimen exhibited the lowest apparent hydrogen diffusivity of the steel due to deformation- induced microstructural defects.\r\nFurthermore, the potentiodynamic polarization studies revealed an electrochemically nobler behavior for the c-PEN surface compared to the untreated steel. Hydrogen permeation behavior on the nitrided surface demonstrated a noticeable drop in hydrogen permeability, diffusivity, and reversible trap density of the steel. These results could be attributed to the microstructure of the c- PEN treated surface, which consists of a globular network morphology of iron nitride and expanded ferrite.\r\n','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline Meeting Link : https://meet.google.com/ghi-ipnq-tia','','',1,'2024-05-20 05:34:13','Active'),(397,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Study of glass Resistive Plate Chamber, Low Gain Avalanche Detector and  Lepton Flavour Universality test in top quarks pair events at CMS','Mr. ANUP KUMAR SIKDAR, (PH16D055)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide: Dr. PRAFULLA KUMAR BEHERA','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/05/21 11:00','2024-05-21','yes','HSB-210, S N BOSE HALL, Department of Physics ','Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) are used in various fields of particle physics for their\r\nhigh precision, longevity, and low-cost nature.

They are widely employed in fields such as nuclear, defence, marine, petrochemical, boiler industries, gas turbines, aircraft engines etc. To protect components from early-stage failure and increase its longevity in aggressive environment (high temperature wear, oxidation, and corrosion), protective coatings/claddings on the surface of superalloys are frequently used. \r\nPresent industry scenario demands surface engineering routes which can be cost effective, energy efficient and time saving with yielding better quality (physical, mechanical, and metallurgical). In the past few years microwave processing has emerged as a new route for many surface engineering applications. The heating of material in microwave process takes place in molecular level, leading to uniform bulk heating at a faster rate than conventional modes of heating. Microwave heating is characterized by volumetric heating associated with reduced thermal gradient, less residual stresses and thermal distortion of the target material while comparing to other thermal processes. \r\nSusceptor-assisted microwave heating is a fast-emerging technology because of its advantages over traditional microwave processing. Susceptor help to speed up microwave processing by offering two-way heating with less heat loss from the material\'s surface. Therefore, the choice of susceptor material is critical as it determines the conversion of microwave energy into heat within the metal. Further, to prevent any heat loss occurring during the microwave process, the workpiece along with susceptor is often enclosed within an insulating box termed as an â€œinsulation casketâ€ or a â€œcasketingâ€. Moreover, the selection of thermocouple materials is essential for accurate temperature monitoring and control during microwave processing. \r\nIn present study, a Co-based surfacing alloy (Co-Ni-Cr-W-C) was chosen as protective coatings for Inconel-718 substrate through microwave route. The successful utilization of microwave technology depends on judicious selection of susceptor, insulation casket and thermocouple materials. Therefore, the present investigation brings out ways (theoretical, simulation and experimental) to select appropriate susceptor, insulation casket and thermocouple material for successful and energy efficient microwave coating/cladding deposition of Co-based surfacing alloy (Co-Ni-Cr-W-C) on Inconel-718 substrate. COMSOL Multiphysics based simulation in conjunction with experimental results were also utilized for critical understanding of heating behaviour of susceptor, insulation casket and thermocouples under microwave environment.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-20 07:21:24','Active'),(400,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Mechanisms and Schemes to Design Electrodes for Lithium-Sulfur and Aluminium-Ion  Batteries: A First Principles Investigation','Mr. ABHIJITHA V G, (PH18D031)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide: Dr. RANJIT KUMAR NANDA & Dr. RAMAPRABHU S','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/05/21 10:00','2024-05-21','yes','https://meet.google.com/geq-tifw-gkz','Rechargeable batteries are considered as the next generation energy storage devices.

The quest for new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) remains a cornerstone in contemporary particle physics, driving the pursuit of novel particles or phenomena that could shed light on the mysteries of the universe. The proposed research focuses on analyzing high-energy collisions to search for high-mass BSM resonances decaying into pairs of photons, a signature indicative of various theoretical extensions to SM, such as Supersymmetry, extra spatial dimensions and  non-minimal Higgs sector. We investigate diphoton invariant mass spectra from 150 to 800 GeV/c2, examining different natural width hypotheses. The analysis employs two benchmark signal models: a) spin-0 resonant states from extended Higgs sector, b) spin-2 gravitons representing the lightest Kaluzaâ€“Klein excitation in Randallâ€“Sundrum (RS1) model postulating a fifth space-like warped dimension accessible only to gravity. Recent intriguing excesses (2-3.5 sigma) reported at the LHC in this phase space further underscores the significance and timeliness of our investigation.Cutting-edge techniques including multivariate analysis (MVA) will be devised to improve photon identification, event classification, and signal extraction from large backgrounds, thereby enhancing analysis sensitivity. The research endeavors to either detect substantial excesses signifying potential discovery of new high-mass particles or establish limits on resonant production cross sections and exclusions on various BSM benchmark scenarios in their absence. The seminar commences with motivations for the search, highlighting SM limitations and the imperative to probe beyond its confines, emphasizing the importance of diphoton channel as a potential probe for new physics. Salient results on signal reconstruction and photon object studies will be presented, alongside a detailed plan outlining the analysis methodology.In summary, the seminar outlines a comprehensive proposal aimed at unraveling the mysteries of elusive high-mass particles with the CMS experiment at LHC, contributing to our understanding of BSM physics and fundamental nature of the universe.','HoD Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-21 06:09:03','Active'),(404,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL',' Data Driven Monitoring of Water Distribution Networks','Rohit Raphael (CH20D018)','PhD Scholar, Department of Chemical Engineering','Guide : Dr. SRIDHARAKUMAR NARASIMHAN ','Department of Chemical Engineering','2024/05/22 12:30','2024-05-22','yes','online','Automated monitoring and control in utility management networks like Water Distribution Networks (WDN) are  implemented using traditional techniques such as SCADA .

The Drucker-Prager (D-P) model is appropriate for predicting the\r\nmacroscopic thermomechanical behaviour of granular pebbles. We developed a numerical\r\nframework to estimate these model parameters using the Discrete Element Method (DEM).\r\nThese model parameters controlled the shape and size of the initial yield envelope. The\r\ndiscrete element method (DEM) was used to perform triaxial compression simulations to\r\nextract these model parameters, which can then describe the constitutive relationship of a\r\nhomogenized finite element model of pebble beds. Current work focuses on investigating the\r\ngranular behaviour of pebble beds by analyzing the DP model parameters extracted from\r\npolydisperse pebbles. Hence, we have analyzed five numerical samples comprising particle size\r\ndistribution (PSD) with a mean diameter of 1 mm and a Gaussian distribution of pebble size\r\nranging from 0.1 mm to 1.9 mm. The primary objective is to understand the effect of PSD on\r\nthe system\'s granular response.\r\nOne of the critical DP parameters is the mesoscale friction angle, which is estimated by plotting\r\nthe point of failure in the meridional plane. Friction angle is a measure of granular strength and\r\n\r\nis defined as the angle between the failure surface and the hydrostatic axis in the pressure-\r\ndeviatoric stress (p-q) plane. Another parameter is the dilatancy angle, extracted from the\r\n\r\ntriaxial compression simulation data and related to the dilatant behaviour of the initial\r\n\r\nhydrostatic compressed sample. Results show that the effect of polydispersity on friction angle\r\nis weak, but it increases as the packing fraction increases. It converges to almost a constant of\r\n29Â°for lower packing fractions (60.50% for the present work) and 31Â°for higher values of\r\npacking fractions. Similarly, the dilation angle decreases as the sample\'s polydispersity\r\nincreases, indicating that highly polydisperse samples are more prone to dilation. Significant\r\nvariations in the difference between friction angle and dilatancy with increasing polydispersity\r\nwere observed. Therefore, the associative flow rule is unsuitable for highly polydisperse\r\nsystems due to their susceptibility to dilatancy. Further detailed analysis of the mesoscopic\r\nmechanics was conducted by examining three parameters based on the mean number of\r\ncontacts, which governed the microstructural similarity of the sample and the extent of particle\r\nparticipation. Also, two local parameters based on Voronoi tesselation were investigated. These\r\nparameters highlight how changing polydispersity influences the local deformation and\r\ncharacterizes local structural variation in the granular samples. In particular, it was found that\r\nthe participation of particles in the total deformation was higher in samples with high\r\npolydispersity.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-21 08:04:56','Active'),(406,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Resilient Software Defined Networks:Traffic Characterization and Candidate Selection under Link Failures','Ms. Navya Vuppalapati (EE17D056)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. Venkatesh T G ','Electrical Engineering','2024/05/24 10:00','2024-05-24','yes','ESB 244/Online','\r\nIn traditional communication networks (TCN), routers and switches are connected using wired or wireless mediums to transmit packets. Each router or switch in TCN operates independently, making its own decisions regarding packet forwarding. This decentralized nature of TCN poses challenges when modifying the network structure or introducing new services, as changes must be made to each network element individually. Additionally, the rapid growth of 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) networks has increased the demand for higher quality of service (QoS) and dynamic network management, putting additional strain on the existing TCN infrastructure. To address these challenges, Software Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged as a new paradigm. SDN provides a centralized network view, enabling the implementation of new services without the need to reprogram each forwarding element or switch individually. In an SDN environment, switches are designed to be non-intelligent, meaning they simply forward packets based on instructions received from a centralized controller. This centralized control and programmability make SDN more flexible and adaptable to changing network requirements, allowing for easier network management and the rapid deployment of new services. \r\n\r\nThe dynamic nature of SDN has made it a preferred choice over TCN. However, this dynamic nature introduces non-stationarity in network traffic, which can have significant implications for network performance and management. In this thesis, our primary objective is to characterize SDN traffic and analyze its behavior under dynamic conditions. To achieve this, we employ the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test to study the non-stationary aspects of SDN traffic. Additionally, we develop a queuing model that can effectively capture the non-stationary conditions of SDN networks. We use the Pointwise Stationary Fluid Flow Approximation (PSFFA) technique to solve for the average queue length at both the controller and the switch in such dynamic scenarios. To ensure the reliability and accuracy of our findings, we validate our analytical results through extensive simulations. Through our work, we highlight the significance of considering the non-stationary behavior of traffic in the design and analysis of SDN systems.\r\n\r\nNext, we address the candidate selection problem in hybrid Internet Protocol (IP)/SDN, specifically focusing on Single Link Failures (SLFs). Our objective is to minimize the number of SDN candidates necessary to safeguard against SLFs in hybrid IP/SDN networks. To accomplish this, we introduce an innovative algorithm called Minimum Candidates Selection (MCS). The MCS algorithm considers all feasible shortest paths between pairs of nodes in the network. By leveraging this comprehensive approach, we can effectively optimize the candidate selection process. To evaluate the performance of the MCS scheme, we assess two key metrics: average repair path length (ARPL) and average maximum link utilization (AMLU). By implementing the MCS algorithm on various real-world and random network topologies, we demonstrate its superiority over existing algorithms.\r\n\r\nLater, we evaluate the performance of a hybrid IP/SDN network in handling single bidirectional link failures. We investigate two CSAs to identify the candidate switches: the Greedy CSA and the Minimum CSA. Initially, we focus on these CSAs with the consideration of a single shortest path between any two nodes within the network. Subsequently, we expand our study by incorporating all the shortest paths between every pair of nodes. Furthermore, we address the challenge of deploying additional candidate switches when there is flexibility in the budget constraints (i.e., the number of candidate switches). To assess the performance of the aforementioned CSAs, we evaluate their ARPL and AMLU across various real-world network topologies.\r\n\r\nFinally, we investigate the critical scenario of multi-link failures (MLF) in a hybrid IP/SDN network. To effectively address this challenge, we propose four CSAs based on a non-shortest path approach. Additionally, we introduce a CSA designed specifically for network scaling or expansion, which optimizes the allocation of candidate switches to safeguard newly established links. Furthermore, we present a budget constraint-based CSA that assists in selecting the most suitable candidate switches within a given budget constraint. To evaluate the performance of the hybrid IP/SDN network with MLFs using the proposed CSAs, we assess the ARPL across various real-world network topologies.\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/aob-qwdm-gio ','','',1,'2024-05-22 04:25:02','Active'),(407,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Designing a MIMO Receiver for Sounding Reference Signal in 5G.','Mr. SANTHOSH KUMAR S.R.

It uses two voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO) to cover an octave range from 12 to 24 GHz. The VCOs employ inductor mode switching in addition to conventional capacitor switching to obtain a wide tuning range while maintaining a good phase noise figure of merit (FoM). Modulus-dependent delay (MDD) of the feedback divider increases jitter in fractional- N mode. The delay change can exceed 100 ps when the number of stages in the divider chain changes. A new digital technique, which can be realized with minor modifications to the conventional digital delta-sigma modulator (DDSM), is implemented to overcome this effect. The delay change is turned into a periodic error at half the reference frequency that is then filtered by the loop filter. The prototype synthesizer in 65-nm CMOS occupies 0.54mm2 and consumes 66 mW at the highest frequency from a 1-V supply, including buffers and dividers. The nominal loop bandwidth is 280 kHz. The integrated jitter is dominated by the VCOs and is 400, 300, and 500 fs in the 6 to 8-GHz, 8 to 10-GHz, and 10 to 12-GHz ranges, respectively. The worst case reference spurs are below âˆ’60dBc and the fractional spurs are below âˆ’31dBc.\r\n\r\nInteger-N PLLs are preferred when fine frequency resolution is not required, and both phase noise and spurious tones must be maintained at very low levels. When the feedback dividerâ€™s modulus is very large, simulating its phase noise contribution can be difficult. This is because the fundamental frequency is the divider output frequency, and enough harmonics must be used to model the switching waveforms at the input frequency. A method will be outlined by which the dividerâ€™s output phase noise can be accurately determined by simulating stages of the divider one at a time. Spurious tones at the reference frequency are expected in an integer-N PLL, but, when the division modulus is odd, spurs can also occur at half the reference frequency. The cause of the sub-reference spurs, as well as possible remedies, will be discussed.\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/bre-rxai-nag','','',1,'2024-05-22 09:20:22','Active'),(409,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMPROVED FRAMEWORK  FOR PARAMETERIZATION OF CONVECTIVE- PERMITTING SCALE MEDIUM-RANGE ENSEMBLE  WEATHER FORECASTS AND ASSESSING ITS IMPACT ON IRRIGATION WATER MANAGEMENT','Ms. Kirthiga S M, Roll No: CE15D300','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. Balaji Narasimhan - Guide, Dr. Chakravarthy Balaji, ME - Co Guide, Dr. K P Sudheer - DC Member, Dr. Palaniappan Ramu, ED - DC Member, Dr. T Sundarajan, ME - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/05/28 15:00','2024-05-28','yes','Conference Room (BSB 104)','','Mathangi G','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-22 09:57:15','Active'),(410,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Thermal Hydraulics of 2x2 rod bundle subjected to clad swelling','Mr. Vikas Bhumarker (AM21S081)','M.S. research scholar, Dept. of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras','Guide(s): Prof. Prasad Patnaik BSV (IITM), Dr. Harish Pothukuchi (IIT Jammu).','Dept. of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering','2024/05/27 15:00','2024-05-27','yes','Online Meeting Link: https://meet.google.com/obm-cypk-yqs','The study of thermal hydraulics of a reactor core is very much essential to ensure the safe operation of nuclear reactors at desired power.

Among rare earth orthoferrites, SmFeO3 is a prominent compound, exhibiting the highest NÃ©el temperature and spin reorientation temperature. Similarly, SmCrO3 is a well-studied system due to its complex magnetic properties. The spin reorientation generates considerable interest due to its application potential in related fields such as spintronic devices. However, the above-room temperature spin reorientation transition in rare earth orthoferrites and the below-room temperature spin reorientation transition in rare earth orthochromites limit their application potential.\r\nIn this work, the spin reorientation of SmFeO3 is tuned to near room temperature through Cr substitution to achieve near room temperature magnetic ordering in the SmFe0.6Cr0.4O3 sample. Additionally, temperature-dependent Raman studies reveal the signature of spin-phonon coupling in the SmFe0.6Cr0.4O3 sample. Investigations of magnetic properties in SmCr1-xFexO3 (x = 0.0, 0.1, and 0.2) samples show that the SmCr0.8Fe0.2O3 sample exhibits intriguing magnetic properties such as negative magnetization and magnetic compensation in field-cooled conditions. Notably, temperature- and field-dependent magnetic switching are demonstrated in the SmCr0.8Fe0.2O3 sample, which also displays the exchange bias phenomenon at 10 K with a remarkable value of -1.39 T as an exchange bias shift. Theoretical models applied to the training effect studies confirm the observed exchange bias effect.\r\nFerroelectric and magnetic studies are performed on polycrystalline and epitaxial SmFe0.6Cr0.4O3 films fabricated by pulsed laser deposition. Piezoresponse force microscopy studies and polarization versus electric field loop measurements suggest ferroelectric-like features in the polycrystalline film. The leaky P-E loops recorded on the epitaxial SmFe0.6Cr0.4O3 thin film also indicate the presence of ferroelectric-like ordering. The canted antiferromagnetic nature of the epitaxial film gives rise to a ferromagnetic-like loop opening at the low field region, with Hc showing an increasing trend as the temperature decreases.\r\n','HoD Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/vxm-ioah-xej','','',1,'2024-05-22 10:17:22','Active'),(412,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Experimental and Numerical Analysis on Friction stir Welding (FSW) of AA6082- T6 aluminium alloy','Ms. PRADEEPTHI PILLALAMARRI (MM21S008)','MS Scholar, Dept. of MME','Guide: Dr. Ranjit Bauri; Co-Guide: Dr. Gandham Phanikumar','Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering','2024/05/24 15:00','2024-05-24','yes','Seminar Hall (NAC 222)','Aluminium alloys are widely used in various applications because of their high specific \r\nstrength and good corrosion resistance.

Therefore, finding a robust, biocompatible material that can be used to develop a miniaturized sensing device is desirable. Several materials, including silicon (Si), Silicon Nitride, and polysilicon, have been used to create ultra-miniature structures. Biological sensors comprising Si or Si3N4 cantilevers were developed and successfully detected antibodies, bacteria cells, and single virus particles. With increased downscaling trends, these traditional materials exhibit various limitations that affect the sensitivity of the fabricated structure. So, there is a need for a superior material that can overcome these limitations and be biocompatible. Initial computational analysis favored SiC over conventional materials, owing to its remarkable mechanical robustness, high thermal conductivity, and chemical inertness.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the superiority of SiC sensors practically, the membrane dimensions were first optimized in COMSOL software. With the simulated design, the resonators were fabricated using single crystalline N-type 4H-SiC by timed Inductively Coupled Plasma-Reactive Ion Etching (ICP-RIE). The etch recipe was optimized to reduce surface roughness, and a 3-layer mask material capable of withstanding the etching conditions was deposited. The resonance frequencies of the membrane were characterized using a dynamic vibration method, and the results were found consistent with COMSOL simulations. To evaluate the mass detection capability, yeast solution was allowed to physically adsorb on the membrane, resulting in a regular shift in resonance frequency for every mode. The membrane resonators demonstrated a mass sensitivity of 11.93 Hz/ng, which was in close agreement with the analytical value. The original resonance frequencies of the resonator were recovered by removing the physically adsorbed yeast chemically. Finally, the membranes were functionalized and exposed to Covaxin. It was able to detect a mass attachment as low as 38 ng. These results validate SiC\'s superiority as a fabrication material for MEMS sensors and also establish a strong foundation for a more reliable, simple, yet robust sensor, overcoming limitations associated with traditional materials.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/vdu-fvzn-vev','','',1,'2024-05-24 04:16:12','Active'),(414,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','DURABILITY OF CALCIUM SULFOALUMINATE BELITE CEMENT CONCRETE AGAINST CARBON DIOXIDE AND CHLORIDE INGRESS','Mr. PAUL SHAJI, Roll No. CE20D001','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. Piyush Chaunsali - Guide, Dr. Manu Santhanam - DC Member, Dr. Radhakrishna G Pillai - DC Member, Dr. Gandham Phanikumar, MM - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/05/30 12:00','2024-05-30','yes','Conference Room (BSB 104)','','Mathangi G','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-24 06:16:17','Active'),(415,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Seminar-II - Impact of Microclimatic Adaptations in shaping Indoor Thermal Comfort and Thermal Comfort based Differential Pricing in Apartment Buildings in Hot Humid Climate.','Ms. R Deepa Rani, Roll No: CE11D016','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. K Ramamurthy - Guide, Dr. Arun Menon - DC Member, Dr. Sivakumar Palaniappan - DC Member, Dr. Satyanarayana M Gummadi, BT - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/05/28 11:00','2024-05-28','yes','Google Meet','The theory of adaptive thermal comfort has gained prominence due to changing\r\nenvironmental factors and place dynamics.

The capsule deformation in microfluidic devices takes place at the microscopic level. Modeling the fluid behavior at such microscopic length scales is important in order to describe the physics of the fluid flow. At smaller length scales, the discreteness of the fluid manifests itself, and atomistic forces such as the Brownian effects and Van der Waals forces play an important role in the hydrodynamics. Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) is a coarse-grained model widely believed to capture the appropriate hydrodynamics at the mesoscale. In the present study, DPD is used to study the deformation of a capsule in microfluidic channels. In particular, the transport of a capsule in a fluid flowing in a converging-diverging channel with a constriction in the middle is studied in detail. The dynamics of the capsule flowing in channels of various constriction width, constriction length and cell speed are studied. The various shapes of the capsule deformed by the channel geometry is captured and the strain distribution in the capsule membrane is examined closely. The strain caused by the deformation is shown to be confined to the front end of the capsule and the regions near the wall. An important effect of the deformation of the capsule is the appearance of pores on the membrane. The pore density in the capsule membrane due to the developed strain is analyzed. The intracellular delivery of drugs is dependent on the pore density. The intracellular drug delivery for the various channel constrictions is modeled by assuming the strain on the capsule to be axisymmetric. The concentration of the drug inside the cell after squeezing is calculated based on diffusion through the pores on the membrane.\r\n\r\nPublications from the thesis:\r\n1.	Rajkamal, N., Vedantam, S.

Interestingly, the disorder can lead to altered critical behavior (including novel university classes) and, at times, even emergent phases. Apart from the ground states, disorder can severely impact the excitations in quantum many-body systems. In this talk, we will examine the multifaceted effects of disorder in condensed matter systems.\r\n In the first part of my talk, we focus on the impact of random-mass disorder on a one-dimensional quantum clock model. A clock model in the clean limit hosts an intermediate emergent continuous symmetry phase in addition to a discretely ordered phase and the paramagnetic phase [1]. We find that a phase transition in the model encodes a disorder-induced crossover wherein the critical exponents continuously vary from that of the clean system to a regime with disorder-dependent exponents. Furthermore, at larger disorder strength, the emergent phase disappears and the system hosts a direct transition from a discretely ordered ferromagnetic state to a paramagnetic state via an Infinite Randomness type fixed point. In the second part of the talk, we will go through the effect of random-connectivity disorder on a superfluid-Mott insulator transition while especially focussing on the effect of such topological disorder on low-energy excitations. We find that consistent with a modified Harris criterion, the critical behavior of the quantum phase transition remains in the clean universality class even in the presence of random-connectivity disorder. Additionally, we find that the amplitude modes in the ordered phase of the system are not affected by the random-connectivity disorder, leading to the conclusion that the localization properties stem from the critical behavior rather than the Anderson-type localization mechanism [2,3,4]. In the third part of the talk, we will discuss the emergent phase and phase transition in a disordered planar spin model with frustrated interactions in a two-dimensional square lattice. It is known that the uncorrelated random impurities cause emergent random-field disorder and destroy the long-range order [5,6]. However, we find that building in anticorrelation in the impurity distribution protects the phases and induces a special transition between the two vestigial phases that obtains with the addition of the anticorrelated impurities.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] J.

Enteric diseases, a significant contributor to childhood mortality and malnutrition, also directly impact the development of the gut microbiome. This study investigates the ability to differentiate between healthy and diarrheal pathogen-infected gut microbiomes to improve health assessments and guide therapeutic interventions. We employ a multi-scale modelling approach integrating machine learning, network analysis and constraint-based modelling methods. However, the initial challenge is to address the uncertainties in building in-silico microbial communities from the amplicon sequencing-derived low-resolution taxa information. We present the â€˜Paneraâ€™ algorithm to generate pan-genus metabolic models (PGMMs) by integrating the existing GSMMs. The demonstrated applicability of PGMM in exploring the metabolic landscape of the genus and improving metabolic predictions of in-silico community models indicates that PGMM facilitates the analysis of context-specific functional similarities between genera and improved prediction (46% better than genus models) of community metabolism through hybrid modelling. The employed Random Forest model identifies 34 microbial species as microbial discriminants with a classification accuracy of 73%. Co-occurrence network analysis reveals distinct microbial association patterns within healthy and dysbiotic gut communities, suggesting a potential role for commensal microbes in shaping the overall ecosystem. Additionally, core microbiome stability analysis highlights the influence of the existing microbial community on subsequent microbe colonisation. In conclusion, the research work presents a viable approach for in-silico microbial community modelling; By elucidating variations in the microbial composition and metabolic interaction structure of the gut microbiome, this work offers valuable insights for developing potential intervention strategies for improved child health.\r\n\r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-24 12:32:57','Active'),(421,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Atomistic Modelling of Atomically Chemically Graded Ti/TiN Interface Using Machine Learning Interatomic Potential','PRADEEP KUMAR RANA , MM21D013','Ph.D Scholar, Dept. of MME','Guide: Dr. Satyesh Kumar Yadav','Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering.','2024/05/31 12:00','2024-05-31','','NAC 222 SEMINAR HALL','Multilayer Ti/TiN nano-heterostructures are promising erosion resistance coatings for application ranging from medical implants to jet engine compressor blades. In nano-heterostructure interfaces play a significant role in dictating their properties. Computational and experimental efforts suggest atomic level chemical gradation can be achieved at Ti/TiN interface. Such chemically graded interface contain range of Ti-N chemistries like, solid solution of N in Ti, Ti2N, Ti4N3, Ti3N2, and Ti6N5. Atomistic modelling of such chemically graded interface can help understand the influence of chemical gradation on properties of heterostructures. This requires interatomic potential that can model all Ti-N chemistries. For Ti-N system we found a MEAM interatomic potential and a machine learned (ML) potential. Potentials suitable for modelling Ti-N should be able to predict formation energies of various chemistries with high degree of accuracy. However, both potentials failed to predict formation energies of various chemistries. Some of the formation energies predicted by potentials differ by several orders compared to density functional theory (DFT). For TiN we found that stacking fault energy (SFE) calculated using MEAM is 10 order higher than calculated using DFT. Thus, there is a need to generate new potential for Ti-N system.\r\nMachine Learning Interatomic Potential (MLIP) in general can fit to complex potential energy surface (PES). By interpolating atomic potential energy surfaces, MLIPs enable the construction of highly accurate interatomic potentials. Interatomic potential for the Ti-N system will be developed using m3gnet framework, based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which can handle diverse chemical spaces. First we will develop potential for bulk Ti-N system by choosing suitable training structures: 1) atomic structures of bulk Ti-N from 0K to 400 K, 2) Ti-N structures, with various types of strain. In order to reliably model dislocations in Ti-N system, we will develop potentials that will trained on structures used to calculate stacking fault energy surfaces. We hope to show that potentials trained on structures used to calculate stacking fault energy surfaces will have similar efficacy as that trained on dislocation structures. This will reduce complexity of generating reliable potential to model dislocations. Potential developed should be suitable to model a chemically graded and sharp Ti/TiN interface. Interaction of dislocation and crack with chemically graded and sharp interface will be studied.

Building on its principles, this research introduces two distinct mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based co-clustering models designed to optimize cellular manufacturing systems. The first model utilizes a binary incidence matrix representing machine-component relationships, while the second employs ratio-level data to reflect the actual machine workload due to specific components. At the core of our approach lies the similarity coefficients, one specifically for binary data and another for workload data, integrating measures of similarity and dissimilarity. The first model aims to minimize exceptional elements outside the cell and voids within the cell for the binary incidence matrix and the second model minimizes workloads associated with intercell movements and the voids within the cells for the ratio level data. This research proposes a comprehensive MILP model to create machine and component clusters and assign them to each other to form groups. A subsequent improvement phase has also been developed for both models, involving the iterative reallocation of machines or components, which refines the cell design. The modelsâ€™ performance is validated using numerous datasets from existing literature and quantitatively assessed using Grouping Efficacy (GE) for the binary incidence matrix and Modified Grouping Efficacy (MGE) for the ratio-level data matrix. The proposed models stand out for their reduced computational time and superior efficacy values across numerous datasets. A detailed sensitivity analysis, including variations in similarity coefficient weights, is also conducted to examine the impact on the quality of cell formation.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','--web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-25 07:00:58','Active'),(423,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Listening to bird\'s dreams','Prof. Gabriel Mindlin','Prof. Gabriel Mindlin is Professor at the University of Buenos Aires (Department of Physics, Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences) and a researcher at CONICET.

However, as the number of cascades increases, the improvements in reconstruction tend to become marginal, indicating possible excess model capacity. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an emerging technique to compress these models, in which a trained deep â€˜teacherâ€™ network is used to distill knowledge to a smaller â€˜studentâ€™ network, such that the student learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher. Most KD methods focus on effectively training the student with a pre-trained teacher that is unaware of the student model.   \r\n\r\nWe propose SFT-KD-Recon, a student-friendly teacher training approach along with the student as a prior step to KD to make the teacher aware of the studentâ€™s structure and capacity and enable aligning the teacherâ€™s representations with the student. In SFT, the teacher is jointly trained with the unfolded branch configurations of the student blocks using three loss terms - teacher-reconstruction loss, student-reconstruction loss, and teacher-student imitation loss, followed by KD of the student. We perform extensive experiments for MRI acceleration in 4x and 5x under-sampling, on the brain and cardiac datasets on five KD methods using the proposed approach as a prior step. We consider the DC-CNN architecture and setup teacher as D5C5 (141765 parameters), and student as D3C5 (49285 parameters) denoting 2.87:1 compression. Results show that (i) our approach consistently improves the KD methods with improved reconstruction performance and image quality, and (ii) the student distilled using our approach is competitive with the teacher, with the performance gap reduced from 0.53 dB to 0.03 dB.\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/xis-pvgg-jos','','',1,'2024-05-27 04:48:36','Active'),(425,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Deep Networks Learn Features for Classification from Local Label Imbalances','Mr. Prithaj Banerjee, Roll No: CS21S045','MS Research Scholar','Dr. Sutanu Chakraborti - GTC Chair,\r\nDr. Harish Guruprasad Ramaswamy - Guide\r\nGTC Members:\r\nDr. B Ravindran - CSE,\r\nDr. Rachel Kalpana Kalaimani - EE.\r\n','Computer Science and Engineering','2024/05/30 10:30','2024-05-30','','MR - I (SSB 233, First Floor)','Deep neural networks outperform kernel machines on several datasets because of \'feature learning\'. A natural notion of features (for classification tasks) is discontinuities in the true label function (Bayes classifier) and the model function. The main feature learning hypothesis we make can be stated as -- \"label function discontinuities attract model function discontinuities while training\". To test this hypothesis, we perform experiments on classification data where the true label function is given by an oblique decision tree -- a setup that allows easy enumeration of label function discontinuities. We then design/construct a novel deep architecture called a Deep Linearly Gated Network (DLGN). The discontinuities of a DLGN in the input space can be easily enumerated, as opposed to a ReLU network.  In this setup, we provide supporting evidence demonstrating the movement of model function discontinuities towards the label function discontinuities. We note that feature learning is essential for good performance in this setup -- standard ReLU nets and DLGNs outperform static kernel methods (such as Kernel-SVM) and tree methods. We then demonstrate the greater mechanistic interpretability of a DLGN by extracting the parameters of a decision tree from the parameters of a DLGN.

Segmental wall construction is the solution to facilitate easy transportation and on-site assembly of heavy precast structural walls. Full-scale experimental tests were conducted on precast structural walls with vertical dry and ductile connections under quasi-static loading conditions. The research proposes the use of improved welded plate connection with tapered plate to connect two structural walls on one or both faces. Special steel shoes were used instead of traditional foundation and loading beams at the top and bottom of the structural walls to reduce costs and to reflect real-site conditions. The experimental results indicate that mild steel plate connections achieve desirable characteristics such as plate yielding, energy dissipation, and ductility. In contrast, high-strength steel is prone to brittle fracture and poor post-peak response, suggesting caution in selecting grade of connecting steel plates for practical use. Full-scale quasi-static tests varied the number of connections and their positions along the height of the connected walls. The results showed that the number and position of connections significantly influence the lateral strength, stiffness, energy dissipation and failure modes. Walls with two connections exhibited improved strength and hysteretic response, demonstrating superior cyclic performance. Increasing the number of connections improves the initial stiffness to a certain extent, but the designs are expensive. Over-strength connections may need to be avoided as they do not necessarily enhance energy dissipation under earthquake loading. The study\'s findings contribute to designing vertically connected precast structural wall systems with better seismic resilience, ductility and ease of connection replacement after an earthquake.','G.Mathangi','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-27 06:16:24','Active'),(427,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','ENHANCING THE RELIABILITY OF HYDROLOGIC SIMULATIONS IN DATA-LIMITED WATERSHEDS THROUGH DATA ASSIMILATION','Ms.Jayaprathiga, Roll No.CE15D052','Ph.D. Scholar\r\n','Dr. K P Sudheer - Guide, Dr. Cibin Raj - Co-guide, Dr. Balaji Narasimhan - DC Member, Dr. Soumendra Nath Kuiry - DC Member, Dr. C Rajendran (MS) - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairman & Head CE','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/06/10 16:00','2024-06-10','yes','Conference Room (BSB 104)','','G.Mathangi','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-27 06:32:03','Active'),(428,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','A Systematic Analysis of the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 Using Uncertainty Quantification','Hariharan R K (ch21s006)','MS, Department of Chemical Engineering','Guide : Dr. Himanshu Goyal','Department of Chemical Engineering','2024/05/30 16:00','2024-05-30','yes','online','Electrochemical reduction of CO2 has emerged as a promising technology to combat climate change.

In order to overcome the limitations of individual techniques, correlative microscopy has been recognized as a powerful approach to obtain complementary information about the investigated materials. High-resolution imaging techniques such as Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) or Helium Ion Microscopy (HIM) offer excellent spatial resolution. However, the analytical techniques associated with TEM such as Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) or Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) are inadequate for the analysis of (i) isotopes, (ii) trace concentrations (< 0.1 at. % or < 1000 ppm) and (iii) light elements (H, Li, B). Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), on the other hand, has several advantages such as the possibility to analyse elements and isotopes of all elements of the periodic table while also providing high-sensitivity to detect even trace concentrations. However, the main drawbacks of SIMS are (i) difficulty in quantification and (ii) lateral resolution of SIMS imaging is fundamentally limited by ion-solid interaction volume to ~10 nm. Owing to the complementary strengths of SIMS imaging, we developed new in-situ and operando instrumentations for correlative microscopy combining electron microscopy and SIMS imaging.\r\nIn this presentation, we will discuss the instrumentation development aspects of correlative microscopy techniques based on SIMS imaging. With a range of examples from energy materials, we will show the powerful correlative microscopy possibilities that emerge due to these new in-situ and operando methods and compare with ex-situ correlation.

Written from the standpoint of a consumer of anti-depressant drugs, Prozac Diary underlines the pervasiveness of professional psychiatryâ€™s pathologizing practices and its psychopharmacological interventions in the nineties in the United States. Moreover, it unpacks the nuances of the relationship between the person and the pill at the intersections of myriad medical and socio-cultural discourses. Drawing from Kimberly K. Emmonsâ€™ notion of the â€œrhetorical care of the selfâ€, I argue that Slaterâ€™s use of figurative language to critically engage with the Prozac discourse and constitute a complex health identity is an individual act of self-care. Furthermore, using Lennard J. Davisâ€™ idea of the dismodernist ethics of â€œcaring about the bodyâ€, I contend that by normalizing illness and challenging the ableist assumptions of normalcy, Slater also invests in rhetorical care of the collective self. \r\n     I demonstrate how through a metaphorical representation of Prozac and the reconstitution of the Prozac \'I\', Slater questions the predominant mental health discourses that construct the meanings of â€˜illnessâ€™ and â€˜healthâ€™ and shape illness and health-based identities. Moreover, by unraveling the ramifications of the lived experience of recovery, as opposed to psychiatryâ€™s perfunctory understanding of biological cure as a restoration of a socially desirable state of â€˜normalcyâ€™, she is able to reclaim the personal and political meanings of recovery. Therefore, I argue that in Prozac Diary, recovery does not merely imply a passive internalization of psychiatryâ€™s biological determinism and its psychopharmaceutical approaches. Instead, it is a rhetorical process that enables the medicalized individuals to actively engage with the mental health system and interrogate the possibility of critically responding to its normative frameworks as agentic subjects.\r\nKeywords: recovery, Prozac, metaphors, health identity, disability','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/yim-ghqi-itg','','',1,'2024-05-27 11:26:54','Active'),(431,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Numerical Analysis of Purge Flow Passage on the Performance of the High-Pressure Transonic Axial Turbine Engines','Ms. Sharmila P (ME17D044)','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Chairperson:\r\nDr. Srinivasan K (Professor, Mechanical Engineering)\r\nGuide: \r\nDr. Dhiman Chatterjee (Professor, Mechanical Engineering)\r\nDC Members: \r\nDr. Mahesh V Panchagnula (Professor, Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering)\r\nDr. Shaligram Tiwari (Professor, Mechanical Engineering)\r\nDr. Shyama Prasad Das (Associate Professor, Mechanical Engineering)','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/05/29 15:00','2024-05-29','yes','Online','The bleed air from the compressor, in the form of purge flow, is injected into the mainstream to prevent the hot air ingestion into the axial turbineâ€™s wheel space.

It also endeavours to map the mutual interactions between film costumes and the constitution of ethnic identities in Kerala society, its reflections and affections within the cinematic conventions and broader socio-cultural premises. A phenomenological investigation, as film scholar Vivian Sobchcak explains, engages in a thick and radical description of film experience, foregrounding the lived body and sensory perception of moving images, thematisation and interpretation of the structures of communication while being in the world (Sobchack 1992; 6). The major questions addressed in this research comprise a) variations in costumes according to changing notions of masculinities and stardom in the characters enacted by Dulquer Salmaan, Fahadh Faasil and Nivin Pauly, b) the role of costumes in the production and communication of religious affects and identities, and c) the visual figurations of Dalit and backward caste identities in selected New Generation Malayalam films. This analysis emphasises the materiality and affects embodied in costumes and moving images and on the social and cultural conditions of production and perception of films. This research has an interdisciplinary orientation which borrows concepts from multiple areas of study, mainly film studies, fashion studies, social anthropology and cultural studies. A broader argument upon which this research is built is that film costumes are a frame and lens to look at cultural identities within and beyond cinema, a rich resource to make sense of the nuances in the manifestation of identities and their complex interrelationships in cultural expressions and corresponding Malayali society, at the intersections of the local, national and transnational flow of ideas, images and commodities. \r\n\r\nKeywords: Film Costumes, Ethnicities, Malayalam Movies, New Generation Cinema, Film Phenomenology, Kerala \r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\r\nSobchack, Vivian.

Graphene-based hybrid nanomaterials are promising due to their excellent heat transport properties. In the first phase of the work, [https://doi.org/10.1039/D2CP03792K], Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the thermal conductivity and thermal boundary conductance of pillared-graphene (PG) materials. For the first time, the study examined how pillar chirality and temperature affect thermal transport in PG architecture, analyzing their impact on in-plane and out-of-plane transport properties. From the temperature-dependent analysis, it was concluded that the phonon-phonon scattering phenomena significantly affect the thermal conductivity of PG with higher pillar length. The phonon density of states (DOS) in different PG regions was investigated, and the overlap factor was calculated to quantify the phonon DOS mismatch. The overlap factor across the pillar region correlates with thermal boundary conductance. When heat is transported in an out-of-plane direction, the zig-zag PG system performs better than the armchair PG system. The atomic arrangement at the interface acts as a bottleneck, limiting heat transport in PG systems. The calculated phonon energy at the interface indicates that the zig-zag PG system transports heat more efficiently than the armchair PG system. In the second phase, [https://doi.org/10.1039/D4CP00147H], the influence of topological defects on thermal transport in the PG architecture was explored, considering Stone-Wales and single vacancy defects. The topological defects in the defective PG system are a significant source of phonon scattering, leading to a highly non-linear temperature profile in the heat transport direction. To ensure accuracy in the thermal conductivity calculation, the Green-Kubo method based on equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations was used. The findings suggest that the thermal conductivity in the PG system can be effectively tuned by defect concentration and its distribution. This unique behavior has the potential to develop tailored thermo-electric devices. To shed more light on phonon-defect scattering phenomena, the degree of phonon localization for the entire phonon vibrational spectrum of the PG architecture was quantified.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline Meeting Link: https://meet.google.com/iyw-ianc-efc','','',1,'2024-05-28 08:03:50','Active'),(437,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Learning to Atlas Register for Rapid Segmentation of Brain Structures and Improved Deep Similarity Metrics','Ms. Tanvi Kulkarni (EE20S046)','MS Scholar, Department of Electrical engineering ','Guide: Mohanasankar S','Electrical Engineering','2024/06/05 14:15','2024-06-05','yes','Online (Googlemeet)','Registration is one of the most preliminary steps in many medical imaging downstream tasks. The registration process essentially aligns images to capture the same overlapping anatomical structures in the input images. Recently, Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have been shown to deliver competitive registration performance as compared to traditional iterative algorithms with a significant computational speedup and efficiency. However, these DL methods can fail to perform for multimodal datasets when the input images display different intensity characteristics, for example, MRI T1 to T2 contrast. DL-based registration is also used to derive segmentation maps, popularly known as atlas-based segmentation (ABS), to segment multiple structures in a single operation. Such methods are often applied for diagnostic and surgical planning purposes. However, due to the training dataâ€™s limited availability and restricting nature, DL-based networks can produce incorrect segmentation maps. Therefore, an automatic quality control tool is necessary to identify such failed ABS processes and take corrective action before proceeding to further downstream tasks, especially when accurate segmentation maps are paramount for safe healthcare applications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn this seminar, we aim to present the steps taken to optimize multiple stages of the DL registration pipeline, which can be critical for efficient process improvements in clinical applications. More specifically, we first study the application of a state-of-the-art learning-based deformable registration framework, VoxelMorph, for challenging Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets of fetal and adult human brains and sub-micron level Nissl-stained histology datasets of adult mouse brain. Secondly, we explore the advantages of leveraging intensity and texture-based features combined with the shape features of the predicted segmentation map to develop a Machine Learning (ML) model for quality control of ABS without ground-truth segmentation maps. Thirdly, we propose a novel data-driven DL-based similarity metric, SiamRegQC. SiamRegQC leverages the semantic representations of the source and target images obtained by training a Siamese network on a two-step binary misalignment classification task. We demonstrate that SiamRegQC can provide better registration performances than traditional and previously proposed deep similarity metrics with a maximum SSIM score of 0.825 for the multi-modal deformable registration between MRI T1 and T2 images.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/aoi-tnyx-hma','','',1,'2024-05-29 08:25:53','Active'),(438,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Analog Front End Design for 5G NR MIMO Base station ',' Mr. Hari Prakash P (EE20S055) ','MS Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. Ganti Radha Krishnan\r\n\r\nCoGuide: Dr. Sankaran Aniruddhan','Electrical Engineering','2024/06/10 15:00','2024-06-10','yes','ESB 244/Online','The architecture of a 5G NR Base Station, often referred to as gNodeB (gNB), encompasses several innovative technologies and components that include Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) configuration and advanced beamforming techniques.

Implementation of Low Impact Development (LID) measures in this context has proven its effectiveness in regulating stormwater runoff at its source of generation. LID measures rely on the principles of sustainability that restore the ecosystem functions and provide resilience to the adverse effects of urban flooding. The impact assessment of LID measures at large spatial scales (such as on a river basin scale) is currently limited due to the absence of hydrological tools based on detailed physical processes. LID simulations at river basin scales also require hydrological models that can account for the spatial heterogeneities in the basin characteristics. To improve the existing LID modelling frameworks, this study attempts to develop LID simulation modules using the physics-based Multi-Layer Green-Ampt (MLGA) infiltration method for river basin scale LID planning and implementation.\r\nThe performance of LID modules based on MLGA was evaluated using the numerically intensive tool HYDRUS 1D for various soil conditions and the results showed that the MLGA-based formulation was able to capture the LID processes with good accuracy and fewer computational efforts. The comparison of LID modules with the widely used Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) indicated that the MLGA-based simulations were closer to the numerical simulations from HYDRUS. The LID modules developed based on MLGA were further used for conducting an optimization-simulation analysis to determine the optimal LID measures that are most suitable for the hydrologically similar sub-basins present in a large river basin. The results indicated that within the impervious areas present in the sub-basins, LID measures are capable of reducing runoff volume between 38% and 82%, and runoff peak between 37% and 75%. The effectiveness of LID measures when translated to the basin scale was found to differ depending on the percentage of imperviousness in the sub-basins. For sub-basins with higher imperviousness, higher runoff reductions were observed and for sub-basins with lower percentage of imperviousness runoff reductions in the range of 2-30% were observed.  The MLGA-based LID modules were also integrated into the sub-routines of the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for a basin scale assessment. The LID impact assessment conducted for the study area, Adyar River basin (830 km2), was shown to reduce the surface runoff by 12% and increase the aquifer recharge by 14% at the basin scale when optimal LID measures were implemented. The results were consistent with the inferences from the optimization-simulation analyses conducted at the basin scale. Hence, the study provides insights into the effectiveness of the LID measures and their implementation scales required for achieving runoff quantity control while adhering to the land developmental rules and regulations.\r\n','R.

The lateral displacement and floor accelerations beyond a specific limit will cause discomfort to the people inside the building. To augment the low intrinsic damping of tall buildings, supplementary damping devices like tuned mass dampers (TMD) that oscillate out of phase with the building are added to dissipate the energy and thus reduce displacements and accelerations. However, a single large, heavy, mass TMD would affect the aesthetic of a building and its maintenance. To alleviate this, multiple-tuned mass dampers (MTMD) are used to reduce maintenance problems as they are efficient even if any of the TMDs are not functional. This research presents a parametric study for the optimal distribution of multiple tuned mass dampers arranged in different spatial patterns. The reduction in the lateral displacements and floor accelerations in the along-wind and torsional responses of the buildings are presented. The steel tall buildings are modelled using SAP2000, a general-purpose FE software. The wind velocity fluctuation time histories generated by the NatHaz Modelling Laboratory have been converted to the wind force time histories and applied to the buildings. The results obtained using MTMDs are compared in terms of power spectral density, peak values, installation area and efficacy.

The integration is discussed in the contexts of two large energy systems (a) hydro power projects and the attendant socio-cultural and economic aspects, and (b) electric power supply by electric vehicle charging stations to electric vehicles.  The first context is elaborated upon by describing how a green energy surplus region, the state of Kerala in India, changed over the years to a thermal energy-mix and energy deficit condition.  This undesirable change has been driven by the strong opposition of environmentalist forces to environmentally benign Hydro-Electric Power Projects (HEPPs) explained by the case of the proposed Athirappilly HEPP.  The strong opposition to HEPPs in the specific local context of Kerala has led to increased emissions in other states and places.  The tenets of Energy Justice â€“ distributional, procedural, recognition and cosmopolitan â€“ have been challenged by the environmentalists\' movement against the Athirappilly HEPP.  The inherent conflicts between environmental law and climate law, on the one hand, and the principles of energy justice and law, on the other, are pointed out.  The concept of \"Power-Environ\" is introduced and characterized, and its relation to Energy Justice and Law is explored for policy formulation.  This concept serves as a foundation for realizing parsimonious and effective representation of the opposition to HEPPs and effectively ushering Energy Justice and Law.  The use of this concept, as an integrated whole, founded on the principles of Energy Justice and Law, should facilitate balanced policy formulation in the Energy sector, especially in India and hopefully across the world too.\r\n\r\nOne of the objectives of this thesis is to present a set of principles underlying the \'Power-Environ\' concept represented by five dimensions, namely (a) the Natural Environment, (b) Energy Infrastructure, (c) Administrative and Legal Issues/Concerns, (d) Political Issues/Concerns, and (e) Socio-Economic Issues/Concerns, in the background of opposition to HEPPs, with particular reference to the proposed Athirappilly HEPP.  These five dimensions are pictorially represented to enable a visual understanding of the principles underlying the \'Power-Environ\' concept.  The energy lifecycle stages and governance bases, the energy law principles and human concerns/aspirations provide the grounds for formulating the principles underlying the \'Power-Environ\' concept within the larger context of energy justice.  Policymakers can use these principles to formulate prudent water management policies, decentralized power systems, decarbonization of the power and transportation sectors, dam safety protocols, and comprehensive supportive schemes for displaced communities.  Policymakers can use the principles to construct an energy justice index based on the proportion of hydropower in the energy mix.  The advantages and disadvantages of HEPPs are examined by adopting a case study approach focused on the conflicts around the projects.\r\n\r\nThe thesis then focuses on electric vehicle charging systems (EVCSs) to further examine the integration of energy justice issues with energy policy formulation, and establishes the need for an electricity tariff policy framework (ETPF) for India.  The proposed ETPF is conceptualized by (a) a conceptual foundation, (b) an operational/functional foundation, and (c) a transactional foundation.  The conceptual foundation incorporates justice risk across the energy lifecycle stages by classifying the relevant international, regional and national issues within the legal layers of energy law while examining the core ideas of the energy trilemma.  The operational/functional foundation consists of techno-economic and social criteria, and the transactional foundation involves consideration of different target sets of end-users.  Considering (a) sustainability, (b) clean development systems, and (c) grid discipline together, it is impractical to apply all the general tariff principles or methods to EVCSs and EVs.  The conceptual foundations should help determine specific tariff policies about public value systems concerning energy sources, environmental effects, socio-economic equity, and developmental priorities.\r\n\r\nThis thesis argues that the change in the energy mix from non-renewable to renewable sources is required and emphasizes the significance of the \'Power-Environ\' concept discussed in chapters 2 and 3.  Other countries should consider adaptation and use of the ETPF with reference to their basic socio-economic, geographic, and political structures.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadra','','',1,'2024-05-30 04:37:33','Active'),(443,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\'\'MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK RESPRESENTATIONS FOR INTERGRATING ENERGY GOVERNANCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES, THE CONTEXT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICY ANALYSIS IN INDIA\'\'','Mr. HARIKRISHNAN G, Roll no.MS15D031 ','Ph.D.SCHOLAR','Prof. R.

At the macro-level, energy runs the economies of nations worldwide. This relationship makes the role of government in providing energy security and access to citizens inevitable.  Energy policies communicate the intentions of a government to the common people with respect to energy planning to achieve long-term economic success and development.  Energy policy analysis is an important area of research as it is used to analyze, frame and implement energy policies that shape up and help in the transition of the economies.\r\n\r\nThis thesis aims to advance energy policy analysis research by researching new frameworks in the era of renewable energy (RE) to be used while formulating energy policies.  In Chapter 1, we critically analyze the Indian energy scenario by taking stock of the consumption of various energy sources.  This study underscores the importance of coal for the Indian economy despite the early RE policies.  The chapter also identifies various constraints in harnessing the different primary energy sources.  The chapter also presents the overall research objective and the structure of the thesis.  In Chapter 2, an empirical study of Indian cities is undertaken for RE for electricity generation and use in Indian cities.  For this purpose, the thesis presents the application of the â€œClimate Smart Cities Assessment Framework (CSCAF)â€ for RE adoption for electricity generation in 45 Indian cities under the Indiaâ€™s â€œSmart Cities Missionâ€.  The results are presented in Chapter 2, and they show that RE penetration in Indian cities is quite low.  Concurrently, further reasons underlying the phenomenon of lesser RE adoption in India is probed by deeper historical analysis of Indian energy policies through a novel eight dimensional framework presented in Chapter 3.  Also, for furthering energy policy analysis research, two perspectives of analysing energy policies are identified and elaborated upon, namely, (i) Energy Policy Issues and Concerns and (ii) Value Chain Analysis in Chapter 4 and in Chapter 5through respective morphological analyses.\r\n\r\nThe studies in Chapters 2 and 3 and the results thereof show that RE adoption in India has lacked attention to environmental justice aspects.  Further, we also find that RE promotion and the transition to a low carbon economy in all nations necessitate the integration of energy governance, environmental justice issues, and their interactions.  A deeper dive into the energy policy analysis literature points to energy-economy-sustainability-policy interactions.  These are considered while integrating energy governance and environmental justice in Chapter 6.  Through a morphological analysis framework (MAF) representation, Chapter 6 presents the integration  through 6 dimensions and 25 variants.  For this purpose, the PESTEL policy analysis discussed in the Chapter 6 is utilised since all dimensions of the PESTEL can be used effectively in the MAF representation.\r\n\r\nThe studies in this thesis have both theoretical and practical implications.  The empirical results and the enunciation of technical, policy and financing barriers in Chapter 2 will allow policymakers and practitioners to understand the current situation better and plan policies and programs to increase RE penetration in the country.  In Chapter 3, the volume of historical policy documents is condensed and presented in 8-dimensional framework to enable practitioners to understand the evolution of policies in the Indian Context.  The two distinct perspectives identified and elaborated upon in Chapters 4 and 5 will be useful to policy makers for holistically analysing the impacts of their policies in solving one or more energy policy issues and concerns, and on the energy value chain.  Also, the MAF representation will enable researchers to analyse energy policies and gain fresh insights using advances in data sciences.  By integrating energy governance and environmental justice principles through the MAF representation in Chapter 6, practitioners will be enabled to analyze the relevant issues holistically including from a social science research angle for better RE policymaking..\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadra','','',1,'2024-05-30 04:56:35','Active'),(444,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','Intensify Brilliance in Supply Chain and Logistics with Gen AI Models','Dr K Ganesh','Dr.K.

Correcting the moonlight / lunar reflection effects in night-time image data is challenging due to the lack of additional bands and large spatial and intensity variations across the scene. In this study, a novel algorithm is developed to correct night-time satellite measurements of water color for lunar reflections to retrieve water-leaving radiances from VIIRS Day/Night Band measurement data. The proposed algorithm involves correcting both the lunar illumination and lunar specular reflection components of moonlight reflection in VIIRS DNB satellite imagery. The algorithm employs the VIIRS products of single-band night-time radiances and moon illumination fractions for deriving an empirical formulation that relates the moon illumination fraction to the lunar component of radiance. The algorithm with a defined spatial filter, turbidity, and boundary conditions is tested on many night-time satellite image data. Qualitative comparisons with VIIRS Day/Night Band measurements showed that the new algorithm has good consistency in water-leaving radiance retrievals along various phases of the lunar cycle, and is capable of dealing with the dynamic lunar reflection intensities across the VIIRS DNB satellite image. This algorithm corrects the lunar reflection effect independently of ancillary data and simultaneous measurements; thus, it proves a robust tool for realizing the dynamic monitoring and inversion of water ocean color data rapidly.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-30 09:47:09','Active'),(449,'','Others',NULL,'Blood Donation Drive on 31/05/2024',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Hi,\r\n\r\nWe are supporting a blood donation drive of VHS in support of patients with Thalassemia on Friday,  31 May.  \r\nFriday\r\n\r\nThalassemia is a genetic disorder that affects nearly 4.2  crore Indians with over a lakh children being born with it.

Written from the standpoint of a consumer of anti-depressant drugs, Prozac Diary underlines the pervasiveness of professional psychiatryâ€™s pathologizing practices and its psychopharmacological interventions in the nineties in the United States. Moreover, it unpacks the nuances of the relationship between the person and the pill at the intersections of myriad medical and socio-cultural discourses. Drawing from Kimberly K. Emmonsâ€™ notion of the â€œrhetorical care of the selfâ€, I argue that Slaterâ€™s use of figurative language to critically engage with the Prozac discourse and constitute a complex health identity is an individual act of self-care. Furthermore, using Lennard J. Davisâ€™ idea of the dismodernist ethics of â€œcaring about the bodyâ€, I contend that by normalizing illness and challenging the ableist assumptions of normalcy, Slater also invests in rhetorical care of the collective self.\r\nI demonstrate how through a metaphorical representation of Prozac and the reconstitution of the Prozac \'I\', Slater questions the predominant mental health discourses that construct the meanings of â€˜illnessâ€™ and â€˜healthâ€™ and shape illness and health-based identities. Moreover, by unraveling the ramifications of the lived experience of recovery, as opposed to psychiatryâ€™s perfunctory understanding of biological cure as a restoration of a socially desirable state of â€˜normalcyâ€™, she is able to reclaim the personal and political meanings of recovery. Therefore, I argue that in Prozac Diary, recovery does not merely imply a passive internalization of psychiatryâ€™s biological determinism and its psychopharmaceutical approaches. Instead, it is a rhetorical process that enables the medicalized individuals to actively engage with the mental health system and interrogate the possibility of critically responding to its normative frameworks as agentic subjects.\r\nKeywords: recovery, Prozac, metaphors, health identity, disability','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/yim-ghqi-itg','','',1,'2024-05-30 11:11:43','Active'),(451,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Computational Modeling and analysis of intracranial aneurysms from patient specific images','Mr. Bolem Srinivas (AM14D021)','Ph.

The rupture of an aneurysm could be detrimental and it could lead to life threatening consequences for most patients. Development of computational tools for the simulations is certainly the first step in generating  virtual patient-specific solutions for decision support and management. Hence, it is important to analyse the rupture risk potential of an unruptured as well as know their rupture status.\r\n\r\nThe present study utilises radiological data from Computed Tomography (CT) angiography for segmenting the domain of specific interest. Various Image processing techniques  are used, as well as developed for the generation of isosurface of the aneurysm and subsequently,  patient-specific realistic vessel models are generated for computational  hemodynamic studies. Based on wall thickness generation algorithms are proposed for enabling fluid structure interaction (FSI) studies. A comparative assessment of the flow features and wall stresses is performed for uniform as well as variable wall thickness conditions is performed. The present study is a first step in enabling analysis, assessment of clinical decisions for the treatment of aneurysms such as, endovascular or open surgery in a patient specific fashion.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline Meeting : https://meet.google.com/zop-wczy-mog          ','','',1,'2024-05-30 12:08:45','Active'),(452,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Resource Allocation for QoS Enforcement in 5G: Trading off Fairness and Delay-Awareness','Ms. Pallavi Varma P K (EE21S057)','MS Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. Krishna Jagannathan\r\nCo-Guide: Dr. Klutto Milleth','Electrical Engineering','2024/06/10 15:00','2024-06-10','yes','ESB 234 (Malaviya Hall)  ','Modern 5G networks support a wide range of services, from highly delay-sensitive vehicular communication to delay-tolerant FTP traffic. Efficient scheduling of the available radio resources is a key aspect in fulfilling these wide-ranging Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Legacy algorithms such as proportional fair and opportunistic scheduling do not help meet the delay requirements. This paper introduces a novel, single-parameter family of scheduling policies that can dynamically trade off fairness for criticality for various types of traffic. In particular, the proposed policy allocates resources based on the criticality of the traffic while maintaining an extent of fairness as dictated by the tunable hyperparameter. Extensive numerical simulations show that the proposed scheduling algorithm reduces timeouts significantly across a range of traffic and latency constraint scenarios. The optimal value of the hyperparameter was another problem to solve. As an extension of the above work, we have arrived at a neural network architecture that would arrive at the required optimal value for the hyperparameter.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-31 05:50:57','Active'),(453,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Control of impinging jet noise through corrugated plates','Ms. Debivarati Sarangi (ME18D007)','Ms. Debivarati Sarangi is a Ph.D. student in the TDCE Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Madras.

The acoustic characteristics of the flat plate were studied at various nozzle pressure ratios (NPR) and standoff distances. The maximum acoustic wavelength for the flat plate was found to be 65.5 mm, 40.47 mm, and 33.83 mm at NPR 2.6, 3.2, and 3.4, respectively. The minimum acoustic wavelength was 7.05 mm. Corrugated plates with different pitch lengths were tested, and the results showed that wider pitch corrugated plates achieved an 8 dB noise reduction by eliminating tonal noise, while narrower pitch corrugated plates reduced total noise by 17 dB through decreased turbulence. The study also examined the presence of various jet modes and their behavior during mode switching. The results showed that the corrugated design generally reduced tonal noise and overall sound pressure level, except in cases where axisymmetric instability (A1, A2) was present. Large eddy simulations were used to study the effect of ground plate corrugations on noise control. The simulations revealed how flow patterns on different surfaces affect noise. An optimization problem was solved using the response surface methodology to determine the flow and geometric parameters that would minimize the overall sound pressure level.

The architecture facilitates the development of an RL agent capable of making driving decisions directly from sensor data. We evaluate the driving performance of the autonomous vehicle (AV) using two types of sensor inputs: top-view images of the AV and its surrounding vehicles, and data on the relative positions and velocities of surrounding vehicles with respect to the AV and compare their efficacy  under varying traffic densities. Furthermore, we extend this end-to-end navigation system to mobile robot navigation within a closed indoor environment, where the robot must navigate from its current position to a desired location without prior access to a map of the environment or any prior knowledge of obstacles.

These gearboxes face stochastic wind speeds and loads, causing significant speed and load fluctuations that complicate fault detection by affecting vibration signal frequency content. Existing methods for detecting gearbox damage are often computationally intensive and require extensive historical data, limiting their practicality for online monitoring systems. This study introduces an experimental test rig that simulates real wind turbine conditions on a scaled-down three-stage planetary gearbox. The rig, equipped with a motor, two epicyclic gearboxes, a power generator, and a resistive rheostat, uses a VFD and waveform generator to replicate wind profiles from commercial farms accurately, validated through statistical performance criteria. Artificial tooth root cracks of varying severity are seeded in the gearbox to simulate defects, allowing for the collection of vibration and rotational speed data via multiple sensors. The study aims to track rotational speed in non-stationary environments, proposing Instantaneous Angular Speed (IAS) measurement from vibration signals as a robust alternative to traditional tachometers and encoders, which are prone to disturbances. Three speed estimation methods based on phase demodulation and time-frequency approaches are compared, with a new method combining cost function ridge estimation and phase demodulation proving most effective. Additionally, the study employs statistical spectral image similarity analysis for early fault diagnosis in rotating machinery under various conditions with minimal vibration data. This method uses discrete multivariate statistical distances as similarity metrics to compare frequency/order spectra images for healthy and faulty states. Extensive tests on gears, bearings, and shafts demonstrate the method\'s effectiveness, with an automated kernel density function establishing an Upper Control Limit to differentiate between faulty and faultless cases, followed by Root Cause Analysis to pinpoint fault origins. This approach also supports prognostic studies based on run-to-failure datasets, concluding that it is well-suited for predictive maintenance, efficiently identifying machinery faults in online vibration-based condition monitoring systems.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/wcq-usxa-gqv','','',1,'2024-05-31 08:23:35','Active'),(456,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','\'\'FROM OPERATIONAL TO DIGITAL EXCELLENCE: STUDIES ON QUALITY MANAGEMENT\'\'.','Mr. RAJAN RANJITH KUMAR, MS16D200','Ph.D. SCHOLAR','Prof. LS GANESH - GUIDE\r\nProf. C.

Organizations deploy a variety of tools to realize effective QM systems.  However, there are many examples of lapses in manufacturing like product defects, product failure, and non-conformance to specifications, and service failures and poor customer satisfaction, in the case of services.  Simultaneously, the advent of Industry 4.0 has influenced organizations to re-invent their processes and reskill their workforce for adopting the concomitant disruptive technologies to transform the competitive business value delivered by them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuality is considered as a continuum with basic quality practices such as 5S for operational excellence at one end, and complex interconnected Digital excellence concepts such as Quality 4.0, at the other.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis study aims to:\r\n\r\na.      strengthen existing Quality practices by proposing an alternative approach to measure organizational maturity in 5S practices, and\r\n\r\nb.      develop a Quality 4.0 framework for Digital Excellence in the context of Industry 4.0.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo realize the first aim, a Biblio-Morphological Analysis of 5S literature has been performed to understand the state-of-the-art of 5S concepts and practices, and identify relevant conceptual gaps that require research.  There is ample scope for research on 5S implementation audit and maturity assessment.  Subsequently, an entropy-based approach was adopted to explore the possibility of quantifying perceived disorder in an enclosed space.  The results are expected to pave the way for developing a 5S maturity model.  The second study involved the identification of relevant factors that contribute to the perception of disorder in an enclosed space followed by an online experiment to collect relevant data in a simulated office space.  This has contributed valuable insights to the development of a quantitative measure of perception of disorder in an enclosed space.  These can be used to conceptualize a 5S maturity assessment method to improve the associated practices.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nResearch on QM in the context of Industry 4.0 is still in its nascent stage, with researchers trying to identify the relevant key components.  For realizing the second aim, the results of the first study have been used to develop a conceptual framework for Quality 4.0, which has been validated through a series of open-ended interviews with top management and C-suite executives from different sectors.  This Quality 4.0 framework expands the horizon of traditional, process-focused quality approaches to a three-dimensional approach comprising People, Processes, and Technology (PPT).  Essentially, it is a meta-framework that identifies ten attributes of Quality 4.0 across the three dimensions.  It points to eight important 4.0 capabilities required by organizations to meet customer and societal requirements.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe final study builds on the conceptual framework, and uses the resource-based view to evaluate Quality 4.0 performance.  A novel method consisting of three levels of hierarchical matrices inspired by the House of Quality (HoQ) is proposed for resource allocation to optimize efforts to meet customer requirements.  The first level matrix is derived from the customer requirements, the levels of each customer requirement, the 4.0 capabilities and the relationship matrix which considers the correlations of the ceiling of the HoQ model.  Similarly, the second level matrix is constructed by taking the 4.0 capabilities as output along with their levels, and the Quality 4.0 dimensions.  The data entered here represent the required level of Q4.0 dimension for a certain level of 4.0 capability.  Likewise, the level 3 matrix is also developed with the Q4.0 dimensions being the target output, and the primary resources, the input.  The dual objectives of maximizing the minimum level of customer requirements and maximizing the product of the relative weightage and level for all customer requirements are achieved using this approach.  This study hopes to add to the extant literature by providing a novel method to arrive at the maximum possible levels of customer requirements, given the capabilities in the organization, and the maturity (levels) of the Quality 4.0 dimensions in that organization.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','SEMINAR - II (RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM)-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-i','','',1,'2024-05-31 10:04:28','Active'),(457,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','A framework for Modelling the Shallow to Deep Geometries Milled by the Abrasive Waterjet in Titanium Alloy','Mr. T.N.

Current flow through the bearings leads to morphological damages leading to generation of noise. It also causes lubricant degradation due to a rise in the contact temperature. To understand the effects of bearing currents, researchers have carried out tests on full bearings and in recent times, using ball-on-disk tribometers. The ball-on-disk configuration offers a few advantages compared to the full bearing tests: simplified procedure to measure contact temperature rise, electrical contact resistance and, friction and failure due to only contact and not due to other components. The lubricant performance was assessed using a custom made electromechanical ball-on-disk tribometer. In the first seminar, the experimental and the numerical simulations carried out in order to predict the temperature rise in ball-on-disk contacts subjected to electromechanical loading was presented. In this seminar, the results of current-voltage characteristic of a lubricating grease in a sliding contact under different contact conditions will be presented. The initiation voltage for current passage and the critical voltage where the friction is affected are found to be dependent on the lubricant film condition. Further, the mechanisms of passage of current in different voltage regimes under static and dynamic contact conditions will be reported.

Task adaptation is commonly addressed through Full Fine-Tuning (FFT), Multi-Task Learning (MTL), and Adapter Tuning (AT), while language adaptation often involves vocabulary expansion and continued pretraining. In this seminar, we will discuss efficient methods for task and language adaptation of language models.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this work focused on task adaptation. We explored the efficiency of FFT, AT, and MTL. We show that for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks, the parameter efficiency of adapters does not translate to overall efficiency gains compared to FFT. Adapters are more expensive to train and have higher deployment latency. Additionally, the maintainability and extensibility benefits of adapters can be achieved with simpler approaches like MTL, which also offer faster training times. Therefore, for moderately sized models in NLU tasks, we recommend practitioners rely on FFT or MTL instead of using adapters.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this work focused on language adaptation. We explored the best initialization methods for extended embeddings after vocabulary expansion. We proposed constrained Word2Vec, which initializes extended embeddings as a weighted average of pre-expansion embeddings, with weights learned from the Word2Vec architecture. We also explored five other baselines. Our findings suggest that simpler, non-resource-intensive methods like multivariate and mean initialization perform as well as the sophisticated approaches, indicating simpler baselines may be sufficient for effective vocabulary expansion in language models.','Hema G','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-03 04:22:20','Active'),(460,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Design and Scaled Prototype Development of Robotic Ingot Handling System for Hazardous Environment','Mr. Amit Kumar Mallick (ME19S058)','MS Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide: Dr. Sourav Rakshit, ME / Co-Guide: Prof. Saravana Kumar G, ED\r\nGTC Members: 1.

In particular, the handling of heavy metal ingots in hazardous environments of metal industries pose significant challenges. Manual handling is not only inefficient but can also be dangerous for workers. Therefore, Industry 4.0 guidelines seek to automate the manual labor-based production system in order to boost output while taking human safety into consideration. This work is motivated by such a semi-manual based heavy metal ingot handling at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and presents the design and development of robotic ingot handling system for a hazardous environment. In order to reduce the involvement of workers in this hazardous scenario, a semi-automated ingot handling system is proposed. The semi-automated ingot handling system operates after the discharge of an ingot or ingot-slag block in the discharge pit. The size of the discharged ingot varies from production batch to batch but its  cylindrical shape remains consistent. The proposed work consists of four main tasks: ingot detection and pose estimation, gripper design, control algorithm and programs, and a scaled prototype of Electric Overhead Traveling (EOT) crane setup controlled by the control programs. The ingot detection is achieved using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) object detection model. A tuned model of YOLOv3 is trained on the customized dataset of ingot and ingot-slag block in various orientations and lighting conditions. The trained model is tested for ingot detection and from the experimental results, it is concluded that YOLOv3 identifies ingots in the given environment accurately. The next step is the position estimation of the ingot, which is accomplished using perspective projection transform. By employing a stereo camera which provides RGB-D image, this method determines the ingot\'s location to an acceptable accuracy in three-dimensional space. From the images of ingot in the discharged pit, two main classes of ingot orientation are identified, one with axis of the ingot perpendicular to the discharge pit floor which is coined as the vertical pose, and the other being the axis of the ingot in a non-vertical state, which we term as the horizontal pose. For each pose, one type of gripper is designed. Due to restriction on use of actuators (electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic), the grippers are actuated by gravity. The gripper for the horizontal pose is a gravity-based scissor mechanism, while the vertical one uses a flexible belt actuated by weights. A user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) is developed using open source packages of Python language to control and monitor the handling process. There are four sub-windows on the GUI which host the control buttons, the control flow chart, the camera view of the discharge pit, and instructions or output messages. The various tasks such as object detection, position estimation, and EOT crane control are developed with independent modules or functions to allow for system adaptability to various changes. As the control algorithm program is scale independent, it can be adapted for the actual system with minor modifications with respect to the driving source of the EOT crane motion. The final part of the ingot handling system is the scaled prototype EOT setup, which is constructed to mimic the actual EOT crane motion and to demonstrate the automatic ingot handling system. The scaled prototype ingot handling system in action was demonstrated for all possible discharge scenarios of ingot or ingot-slag block. The system successfully achieved the objectives of this work, yielding satisfactory results. The scaled prototype ingot handling system has been transported and installed at Division of Remote Handling and Robotics(DRHR), BARC, Mumbai.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/krw-quue-dkn ','','',1,'2024-06-03 04:56:28','Active'),(461,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Building and Evaluating large-scale, broad-coverage multilingual translation models for Indian languages','Mr. Pranjal Agadh Chitale, Roll No: CS21S022','MS Research Scholar\r\n','Dr. Sutanu Chakraborti - GTC Chair, Dr. Mitesh Khapra - Guide, Dr. Anoop Kunchukuttan - Co Guide, GTC Members: Dr. Arun Rajkumar - CSE, Dr. Avhishek Chatterjee - EE.','Department of Computer Science and Engineering','2024/06/06 14:00','2024-06-06','','MR - I (SSB 233, First Floor)','India\'s linguistic diversity, encompassing languages from four major families spoken by over a billion people, presents unique challenges and opportunities for Machine Translation (MT). This work addresses the gap in high-quality and accessible MT systems for India\'s 22 constitutionally recognized languages. Previously, there was no comprehensive parallel training data, robust demography-focused benchmarks, or translation models that supported all of these languages. The first part of this study focuses on creating and open-sourcing high-quality training datasets, diverse benchmarks, and robust multilingual translation models. The first major contribution is the BPCC (Bharat Parallel Corpora Collection), the largest publicly available parallel corpora for Indic languages, consisting of 230 million bitext pairs, including 126 million newly added pairs and 644K professionally translated sentence pairs. Further, we release the first multi-domain, India-centric, n-way parallel benchmark for all 22 languages, covering both prose as well as conversational content. The IndicTrans2 models, supporting all 22 languages, outperform all existing models, including commercial systems, across multiple benchmarks on English-centric as well as non-English-centric directions. To ensure widespread adoption, we further release lightweight distilled variants of these models, offering competitive performance to the larger models. The second part of this work explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for MT via in-context learning (ICL). This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of ICL for MT, revealing that ICL is primarily driven by examples rather than instructions. It examines factors influencing performance, such as the quality and quantity of demonstrations, spatial proximity, and the originality of source versus target content. The study also explores challenging scenarios like indirectness and misalignment, finding that target distribution quality is crucial, and sometimes perturbations can also enhance performance. Notably, ICL does not require examples from the same task; related tasks with the same target distribution are sufficient.','Hema G','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-03 05:34:26','Active'),(462,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','A Comprehensive Oscillatory Deep Neural Network Model of Spatial Cells in Hippocampal formation','Ms. Azra Aziz (BT17D025)','Ph.D. Research Scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Dr. V Srinivasa Chakravarthy','Department of Biotechnology','2024/06/07 14:00','2024-06-07','','Google Meet - https://meet.google.com/jni-xbeh-ngy','Navigation is an important ability acquired by animals for their survival. Hippocampal formation located in the temporal region of the brain facilitates this function through specialized spatial cells. These spatial cells encode information about the animal\'s current location, head direction, environmental boundaries, objects and landmarks, and location in the environment. Therefore, the hippocampal formation forms the natural Global Positioning System (GPS) for animals. \r\nIn this study, a comprehensive oscillatory deep neural network to model various cells of hippocampal formation is developed. The model has been tested by comparing the model results with experimental results. \r\nIn the first study, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model of the path integration (PI) cell responses that shows the emergence of cells with grid-like spatial periodicity. It is shown that the response of these cells could be described by Bessel functions. Next, a general, deep learning-based autoencoder modelling framework that describes the emergence of spatial cell responses and can also explain responses that involve a combination of path integration and vision is presented. The study is concluded by verifying the model with two experimental studies.\r\nIn the second study, our model is extended to represent a 3D environment while the surface-dwelling animals are made to move in 3D mazes. The model quickly adapted the extra features like information on pitch angles while navigating in a 3D environment. The model is validated with four varied environments (aligned lattice, tilted lattice, helix and pegboard mazes) used in experimental studies. This model also hypothesizes the reason for encoding the 3D environment in different ways by various species of animals, as it has been found that the place fields and grid fields are elongated on the gravity axis when a surface-dwelling animal explores the 3D environment.\r\nObjects and landmarks play a vital role in navigation. In the third and final study, a comprehensive deep-learning model with multisensory integration for hippocampal spatial and object-responsive cells is proposed. The model contains two pathways, including vision and PI. At a higher level, both pipelines connect to each other using a graph convolution layer, which is reminiscent of lateral connections between the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). The model is trained for the position, head direction, and reward in the output layer. The hidden layers of this model show the emergence of grid, place, border, object-sensitive, object, object-vector, and object-trace cells under different environmental setups.','BT OFFICE','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/jni-xbeh-ngy','','',1,'2024-06-03 05:53:00','Active'),(463,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Ph.D Seminar II - Study on Mode II Fracture Parameters and Shear Strength of   Palin and Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete ','Mr. Sudhakar Darla, Roll No. CE20D002','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. Appa Rao G - Guide, Dr. Amlan K Sengupta - DC Member, Dr. Raghukanth S T G - DC Member, Dr. Vengadesan S (AM) - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/06/07 11:00','2024-06-07','yes','Visveswaraya Seminar Hall (BSB368) - Second Floor','Mode II fracture properties are important in cementitious products, as they prone to fail suddenly.

Six different plain concrete mixes have been developed. Eighteen double-notched concrete prisms were tested under direct shear loading. The ultimate shear strength increases with increasing the compressive strength of concrete up to (fck) 62.50 MPa and remains constant beyond 70.23 MPa. The fracture toughness of concrete increases proportionately with increase in the compressive strength of concrete up to 62 MPa. \r\nIn normal and high strength SFRC, experiments were carried out with different volume fractions (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%) of 4D hooked-end steel fibres of length 30mm and 0.55mm diameter under Mode-II loading. Twenty-four double-notched prisms were tested. The normal strength concrete exhibits higher shear strength than high strength concrete. Addition of fibres improves the shear strength and shear toughness. The improvement has been significant at higher fibre dosages (Vf = 1.5%). In NSC, 1.5% fibres increase the ultimate shear strength while in HSC, adding 1.0% and 1.5% fibres increases the ultimate shear strength. \r\nThe compressive strength, water permeability, and oxygen permeability, and rapid chloride penetration (RCP) of various ternary blended concretes using various cementitious and water content have been investigated.

The use of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) approach is increasingly prevalent in the infrastructure sector apart from the traditional Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract. Governments from more than 100 countries across the globe have enacted some form of transparency law in the recent past. Transparency law in India was enacted by the parliament in the form of the Right to Information (RTI) Act in 2005. The enactment of this law is seen as an essential milestone for ensuring transparency and accountability in governance. However, the empirical evidence of its impact is limited. This study analyses the effect of transparency law using data from 997 highway projects in India.\r\n\r\nThree research objectives are investigated: (i) Effect of transparency on performance during the construction phase, (ii) Effect of transparency on the choice of procurement model, and (iii) Effect of transparency on the post-award development phase of PPP projects. The main research findings are: (i) Transparency decreased the unit time and time overrun of the EPC and PPP project. It also decreased the unit cost and cost overrun of the EPC project. However, it had an increasing effect on the unit cost and cost overrun of PPP projects. (ii) Among the total projects, the proportion of EPC projects increased after the enactment of the transparency law. Moreover, among the PPP projects, the proportion of BOT-Annuity projects increased after the enactment of the transparency law. (iii) Transparency led to a longer post-award development phase of PPP projects; however, a longer post-award development phase resulted in a shorter construction phase. The post-award development phase of BOT-Toll projects was prolonged because of the transparency law.\r\n\r\nCost and time overrun in infrastructure projects are a global phenomenon that has not changed for several decades. Our finding gives new hope that project performance during the construction phase has improved in recent years because of the transparency law. Transparency in highway projects can lead to optimal project risk allocation among the parties, thereby impacting the choice of procurement model. In a transparent environment, the risk mitigation of the projects during the development phase is better, resulting in better performance during the construction phase. Government should promote the disclosure of project information at every stage of the project life cycle.\r\nKeywords: transparency, EPC, PPP, cost overrun, time overrun','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','SEMINAR - II (RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM)-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-03 09:40:28','Active'),(465,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Seminar II - Performance of RC Precast Beam- beam Dry Connections Under Cyclic Loading','Mr.Vivek K Viswanath, Roll No: CE17D022','Ph.D Scholar','Dr. Apparao G - Guide, Dr. Raghukanth S T G - DC Member, Dr. Lakshmi Priya P S - DC Member, Dr. Ramesh K (AM) - DC Member , Dr. Benny Raphael - CE Head & DC Chairperson','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/06/06 14:30','2024-06-06','yes','Visveswaraya Seminar Hall (BSB368) - Second Floor','Many precast concrete structures have been designed to withstand gravity loads only.

The behavior of monolithically cast and segmentally connected beam specimens has been studied under quasi-static reverse cyclic loading. The seismic performance of precast beam-beam connections with two types of dry connections with varying levels of prestress through stiffness degradation, mode of failure, and load-displacement hysteretic behavior, ductility, and energy dissipation has been reported.

Therefore, the study of ground motion time histories holds an essential place in earthquake engineering. However, ground motion records corresponding to the specific combination of predictor variables such as magnitude, distance and soil type are often unavailable. Therefore, it is important to simulate ground motions for locations lacking natural records. However, generating ground motion time histories is extremely challenging due to the complex nature of earthquake ground motions. The present study develops ground motion models using both analytical and empirical methods. In the first approach, the broadband ground motions are simulated by combining deterministically generated low-frequency waveforms using the spectral element method with stochastically simulated high-frequency ground motions based on an improved seismological model. The simulation methodology is validated using the recorded data of the 2015 Mw 7.9 Nepal earthquake. The same approach is applied to simulate and analyze historical events like the 1934 Mw 8.2 Bihar-Nepal earthquake and the 2016 Mw 6.8 Chauk, Myanmar earthquake. Furthermore, using physics-based simulations, site amplification analysis and deterministic seismic hazard analysis are performed for severe scenarios resulting from maximum credible earthquakes.\r\nIn contrast, probabilistic seismic hazard analysis requires a comprehensive ground motion model, which can be developed using an empirical approach based on a diverse dataset representing multiple scenarios. Therefore, in the second approach, the study evaluates the ground parameters of the 2023 Turkey earthquake sequence in comparison to Himalayan events to investigate the near-field effects. Furthermore, a near-field correction factor is proposed by combining the NEar-Source Strong motion (NESS) database. In addition, an Artificial Neural Network-based ground motion model is developed for equivalent velocity spectra, which is an inertia-independent representation of the input energy spectra. Finally, probabilistic seismic hazard analysis is performed to estimate uniform hazard input energy spectra and a design input energy spectra is proposed for the Himalayan region.','R.

Brittle failures are commonly observed in lap-spliced walls, which needs minimization of percentage of rebars to be lap-spliced at a section. High-rise buildings with higher mode participation during an earthquake may form plastic hinges in members of upper floors, where lap splices present are critical. Thus, the lap splice location needs shifting away from such plastic hinges. Four half-scale reinforced concrete walls with boundary elements as reflected in a 6-story building designed as per IS 3920 and ACI 318 were tested under quasi-static reversed cyclic loading. Staggered lap splicing of 100, 50, and 33% main rebars were adopted along with a control wall without lap splicing. Detailing and placing of lap splices were adopted to prevent premature failure of RC structural components. Performance of RC walls with different percentages of lap-splicing of rebars are studied. The staggered lap splicing of rebars reduces the strength and deformation, and the post-peak strength was not sustained by the un-spliced rebars. The experimental observations question the efficiency of detailing provisions of ACI 318, EC2, and IS 13920 on the reduction of staggered lap splice length. Numerical results with finite element analysis software Abaqus with bond-slip mechanism are validated with the experimental results.

This research thus embarks on a journey to augment the knowledge discovery process through strategies grounded in scientometric methods, catering to the needs of both novice and seasoned researchers. The research delves into the foundational principles of scientific inquiry, emphasizing the necessity of rigorous methodologies and systematic exploration of literature. This foundational discussion serves as a guiding light for providing novice researchers with essential insights through a literature exploration and enhances the experience of seasoned researchers through additional strategies. \r\n\r\nThe first study introduces a systematic approach to conducting bibliometric analysis offering significant benefits to novice researchers. Through an efficient integration of advanced techniques from network analysis and natural language processing, the proposed workflow provides novices with a structured approach to navigating large-scale and complex bibliographic databases. The application of the approach on a real-world dataset demonstrates the scalability and flexibility in conducting the analysis and also extracting meaningful insights. The bibliometric analysis can provide a suitable starting point to novice researchers looking to start investigations in a field and guide their research objectives. The second study focuses on developing a recommendation algorithm that prioritizes article quality, semantic relatedness, and community structure in a citation network. By a judicious incorporation of these factors, the algorithm aims to suggest relevant articles with precision and higher scalability. These systems benefit novice researchers and seasoned researchers to efficiently sift through the overwhelming volume of scholarly literature, saving time and effort in research endeavours. While bibliometric analysis may provide a necessary starting point and an objective view of the literature, recommendation systems help researchers further their inquiry in their desired directions through relevant suggestions for papers they have read. These systems can help them stay updated in their field, and obtain related and contextually similar articles that were previously unexplored, thus enriching the experience of the researchers. Lastly, the research delves into the phenomenon of delayed recognition in literature, providing valuable insights that are particularly relevant to seasoned researchers. By identifying and analyzing â€œsleeping beautiesâ€, the seasoned researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of scholarly communication. This allows them to recognize overlooked or undervalued contributions within the literature and potentially uncover new avenues for exploration. Thus, through an empirical study, a novel method to identify sleeping beauties is proposed. Further, papers experiencing delayed recognition are characterized and through case studies, reasons for delayed recognition are explored. \r\n\r\nOverall, this research contributes to the advancement of the knowledge discovery process in digital libraries by proposing relevant and effective strategies drawn from scientometric principles.

Unfortunately, factors such as improper maintenance can lead to faults that increase both energy consumption and maintenance expenses. An effective Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) system is essential to address this issue. The cooling load of a building varies throughout the day due to changes in occupancy, ambient temperature, incident solar radiation, and other factors. Most physics-based FDD approaches rely on steady-state methods; however, data-driven approaches utilizing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms offer numerous advantages for this application.\r\nTypically, data-driven models require extensive datasets to achieve high performance. However, in real-world systems, the availability of huge amount of data may be limited. This study addresses the issue of data sufficiency by highlighting that high-performing FDD models do not necessarily require large datasets. It demonstrates that models can perform well with a limited number of data points for each fault. With limited dataset, four ML techniques were evaluated based on their fault detection rate, F1 score, and reliability as assessed through trust ccore analysis. Despite the excellent FDD performance of ML algorithms, stakeholders often hesitate to adopt them due to their complexity and lack of interpretability.\r\nTo overcome this challenge, this study explores the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to improve FDD in Air Handling Units (AHUs). By incorporating XAI techniques such as Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), the study aims to enhance the interpretability and transparency of ML models for FDD. Among the evaluated techniques, XGBoost was found to be the most effective for the FDD model in its ability to accurately identify faults. SHAP was leveraged to provide both global and local explanations for interpreting the developed model. The SHAP summary plot facilitated the identification of significant features, which were corroborated with findings from existing literature to authenticate the model\'s credibility. The SHAP force plot was also utilized to offer visual explanations for individual fault occurrences, thereby enhancing understanding and trust in the model\'s predictions. Additionally, Shapley values were used to visualize the specific parts of the signal that caused the fault. Furthermore, counterfactual statements were employed to propose remedial actions tailored to specific fault scenarios, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.\r\nThis study showcases the potential of XAI techniques to enhance the transparency and interpretability of ML models for FDD in AHUs using the ASHRAE RP-1312 dataset,. By providing clear and actionable insights into HVAC system performance, these techniques enable stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize system operation, and effectively reduce energy consumption and maintenance costs. The seamless integration of ML and XAI in this research advances fault detection and diagnosis practices in HVAC systems, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient building operations.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/owo-bfjw-csq','','',1,'2024-06-03 10:21:06','Active'),(470,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Seminar II - Stability analysis and Bimoment predictions for cold-formed steel purlins interacting with roofing systems','Mr. Sodumu Ravikanth Reddy, Roll No.CE18D206','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. Arul Jayachandran - Guide, Dr. Raghukanth S T G - DC Member, Dr. Alagappan P - DC Member, Dr. Velmurugan R - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael -Chairperson & Head CE','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/06/05 15:00','2024-06-05','yes','Conference Room (BSB 104)','In this study, the analytical method and experimental work are developed to design purlins interacting roofing systems.

This method will apply to the TF systems. The hidden clip systems, such as SSMR systems, provide stability to the purlins through rotational restraints, enhancing the load-carrying capacity. The codes of practice limited the design of such systems by experimental procedures. The experiments are carried out with MR24 and kliplok SSMR systems. The presentation will discuss the development of analytical methods and experimental work on SSMR systems.','R.

These suicides have left many families struggling to survive after losing their â€œmale heads of households.â€ While their husbands succumbed to the pressures of mounting debts and challenges of running the households, the widow farmers have displayed resilience, navigating severe economic conditions to ensure their family\'s survival. This study examines how the widow farmers negotiate patriarchal structures within the farming landscape and societal norms surrounding widowhood, in their efforts to assert their rights and sustain their families. The study also analyzes how these survival strategies vary based on household structures, dynamics, and broader social networks. Elements such as headship and household composition influence intra- and inter-household negotiations, affecting choices, strategies, and the exercise of agency. Findings indicate that while the death of the male farmer disrupts household relations and can lead to conflict, it also fosters new forms of cooperative behavior. Widow farmers are forming new relationships, connecting with other women farmers and grassroots organizations, which are reshaping household organization and functioning, introducing alternative social structures and support systems. Through this research, the unique attributes and experiences of widow farmers as a distinct demographic are highlighted, providing a basis for policy recommendations that address their specific needs and concerns. A deeper understanding of household dynamics and movements can enhance the targeting of social protection measures and government programs. Furthermore, the study\'s insights have significant implications for how support is provided and social capital is built within this community.\r\n\r\n','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/mmr-ycsu-uzh','','',1,'2024-06-03 11:42:37','Active'),(472,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Control of impinging jet noise through corrugated plates','Ms. Debivarati Sarangi (ME18D007)','Ms. Debivarati Sarangi is a Ph.D. student in the TDCE Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Madras.

The acoustic characteristics of the flat plate were studied at various nozzle pressure ratios (NPR) and standoff distances. The maximum acoustic wavelength for the flat plate was found to be 65.5 mm, 40.47 mm, and 33.83 mm at NPR 2.6, 3.2, and 3.4, respectively. The minimum acoustic wavelength was 7.05 mm. Corrugated plates with different pitch lengths were tested, and the results showed that wider pitch corrugated plates achieved an 8 dB noise reduction by eliminating tonal noise, while narrower pitch corrugated plates reduced total noise by 17 dB through decreased turbulence. The study also examined the presence of various jet modes and their behavior during mode switching. The results showed that the corrugated design generally reduced tonal noise and overall sound pressure level, except in cases where axisymmetric instability (A1, A2) was present. Large eddy simulations were used to study the effect of ground plate corrugations on noise control. The simulations revealed how flow patterns on different surfaces affect noise. An optimization problem was solved using the response surface methodology to determine the flow and geometric parameters that would minimize the overall sound pressure level. The results showed that the D-optimality method predicted the responses more accurately in comparison to the Taguchi method.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','The results have published in the following journals: 1. https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4054254 2. https:','','',1,'2024-06-04 02:10:50','Active'),(473,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL',' Power Management and Control Strategies for Renewable Energy-based Microgrid System','Mr. Durga Malleswara Rao K (EE17D036)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Mahesh Kumar ','Electrical Engineering','2024/06/10 15:00','2024-06-10','yes','Online (Googlemeet)','As concerns regarding energy costs, environmental impact, energy security, and energy policies continue to rise, there is a growing trend toward integrating distributed generation systems based on Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) into microgrid systems. Hybrid AC-DC microgrid systems, which incorporate AC and DC sources, loads, and storage, are considered the most promising structures for future distribution and transmission networks. Due to the intermittent nature of RESs and the unpredictable changes in loads, there is a need for high-power and high-energy density storage systems in today\'s hybrid AC-DC microgrid systems. Energy storage is crucial in enhancing the dynamic stability of renewable grid-integrated systems. It helps to mitigate the effects of RESs intermittency and load fluctuations within the microgrid environment. However, developing effective energy management schemes and control techniques for such hybrid AC-DC microgrids poses significant challenges. The present work aims to address these challenges and provide solutions to these potential problems by exploring and proposing suitable approaches and strategies.\r\n\r\nThis thesis presents (i) the development of a supervisory power management system has been focused on a DC microgrid equipped with hybrid energy storage. It is of utmost importance to utilize all the available energy sources effectively to maintain power balance in the system, (ii) a novel DC bus voltage controller is proposed to regulate and maintain a constant voltage on the DC bus despite varying environmental conditions, including wind gusts, zero solar irradiation, and grid interruptions, (iii) a new model predictive control techniques is proposed for grid-connected inverter. The proposed controller is based on the predictive control for a three-phase two-level grid-connected inverter with LCL filter.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of the control schemes and energy management strategies presented in this work is verified through digital simulations and experimental studies.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/eco-exqk-kis ','','',1,'2024-06-04 03:13:31','Active'),(474,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL',' â€œTransition-Metal-Catalyzed Amide Directed Dehydrogenation and Site-Selective Functionalization of Olefinsâ€ ','Ms. Keerthana M S (CY18D011)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Jeganmohan M, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/06/11 11:00','2024-06-11','yes','Online-Google Meet','','CY OFFICE','cyoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','ALL ARE WELCOME-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/qht-koch-xpx','','',1,'2024-06-04 03:40:39','Active'),(476,'','Workshop',NULL,'WED2024: Invitation to Workshop on \\\"﻿Environment & Health: Healthy Planet, Healthy Community and Healthy You\\\" @ IIT Madras on 5th June 2024',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Dear Colleagues, \r\n \r\nGreetings from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) & Madras Medical College (MMC)! \r\n\r\nWe are pleased to inform you that the Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Madras, and the Institute of Community Medicine, Madras Medical College, are jointly celebrating \\\"World Environment Day\\\'\\\' on 05 June 2024. 5th June (World Environment Day) celebrates our planet\\\'s beauty while highlighting the crucial link between a healthy environment and human well-being.

Health Technology Assessment India (HTAIn) was set up to ensure efficient allocation of public health expenditure that will impact the health of 1.4 billion Indians. This study aims to review the research undertaken by HTAIn to date, focusing on their characteristics and quality appraisal, and to recommend the way forward. \r\nMethods: All the studies undertaken and published by HTAIn on their website were screened. Shortlisted studies were analysed to identify the diseases addressed, the type of interventions evaluated, the aspects of HTA addressed, and whether the intervention was cost effective. The quality of each study was rated against Drummondâ€™s checklist and against the Indian Reference Case. Results were charted and tabulated where possible, and a narrative synthesis of findings was set down.\r\nResults: This review shortlisted 33 of the 39 studies published by HTAIn on their website on October 2023. 24% (8 studies) focussed on interventions for maternal and neonatal disorders. 33% (11) of the interventions were devices and 45% (15) were intended for screening. All studies addressed the question of economic efficiency, 75% (25) evaluated clinical efficacy, and 53% (18) spoke of effectiveness. 44% (15) addressed all three aspects. Against the Indian Reference Case, 6 studies scored above 8, and the rest scored between 4.55 and 7.95. Equity (26%) and heterogeneity (population subgroup analysis) (24%) are the parameters that scored worst. \r\nConclusions: A formal framework for choosing interventions that are to be evaluated would help make the decision-making process explicit. While difficult to evaluate, operational feasibility, equity and heterogeneity need to be considered in more studies to ensure that policy-makers are drawing more considered conclusions. As most interventions studied are cost-effective, areas for disinvestment need to be identified, given health budget constraints.\r\n\r\n','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/hkh-bdew-sak','','',1,'2024-06-04 07:27:03','Active'),(478,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Rolling Contact Fatigue Behaviour of Polyamide 6 Nanocomposite','Mr. Finney Charles.

Several autoencoder- based approaches have been used to solve UAD tasks. However, most of these approaches do not have any constraints to ensure the removal of pathological features while restoring the healthy regions in the pseudo-healthy image reconstruction. To minimize the occurrence of pathological features, we propose to utilize an Autoencoder that deploys a masking strategy to reconstruct images. Additionally, the masked regions need to be meaningfully in-painted to enforce global and local consistency in the generated images which makes transformer-based masked autoencoder a potential approach. Although the transformer models can incorporate global contextual information, they are often computationally expensive and dependent on a large amount of data for training. Hence, we propose to employ a Swin transformer-based Masked Autoencoder (MAE) for anomaly detection (Ano-swinMAE) in brain MRI.\r\n \r\nOur proposed method Ano-swinMAE is trained on a healthy cohort by masking a certain percentage of information from the input images. While inferring, a pathological image is given to the model, and different segments of the brain MRI slice are sequentially masked, and their corresponding generation is accumulated to create a map indicating potential locations of pathologies. We have quantitatively and qualitatively validated the performance increment of our method on the following publicly available datasets: BraTS (Glioma), MSLUB (Multiple Sclerosis), and White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH). We have also empirically evaluated the generalization capability of the method in a cross-modality data setup.\r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/oph-xfrd-bnz','','',1,'2024-06-04 08:42:14','Active'),(480,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','CE7999 -  Comparative Study on Strain-Based Parameters for the Health Monitoring of Truss Bridge Using Real-Life Data','Mr. Kaibalya Lenka, Roll No.CE19D414','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. U Saravanan - Guide, Dr. S Arul Jayachandran - DC Member, Dr. Alagappan P - DC Member, Dr. K Ramesh (AM) - DC Member & Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE\r\n','Civil Engineering','2024/06/06 15:30','2024-06-06','yes','Google Meet','Railway truss bridges serve as vital components of transportation infrastructure, facilitating\r\nthe smooth and efficient movement of goods and passengers across long distances.

The performance of PEM fuel cell that uses hydrogen as the fuel and pure oxygen as the oxidant is a strong function of water management and researchers have investigated those in single channel domain. Hence, there is a need to study water distribution in the complete fuel cell domain containing both the anode and cathode sides. Liquid water causes flooding in the gas diffusion layer, catalyst layer as well as in channels due to which the active surface area of the catalyst in the CL reduces and hence the reaction rate reduces. Phase transfer between liquid water and water vapor is the factor influencing liquid water buildup in the domains. In the present work a three-dimensional, non-isothermal, two-phase numerical model incorporating cathode and anode domains for studying water distribution is developed. The model includes water phase transition in the GDL, CL and channels. The mixed flow distributor is used to study the water formation and distribution throughout the domain. The developed numerical model is validated by comparing the polarization curve with the experimental results. The study shows that the ohmic region in the polarization curve increases and the concentration losses decrease due to the use of pure oxygen at inlet which can be important for applications such as in spacecraft. The effects of liquid water accumulation in the domain on the reactant transport, current density and temperature distribution are also investigated by comparing the results for pristine graphite channels with super-hydrophobic graphite channels.\r\n\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/hes-sppt-nmv','','',1,'2024-06-04 11:17:56','Active'),(483,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','A modeling framework for performance assessment of irrigation system at river basin scale using Remote sensing-based evapotranspiration and hydrologic crop growth models','Ms. NOUFIA M A Roll No: CE20D090','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. Balaji Narasimhan - Guide, Dr. Venkatraman Srinivasan - DC Member, Dr. Subbarao Pichuka - DC Member, Dr. Chakravarthy Balaji (ME) - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael -Chairperson & Head CE\r\n','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/06/12 11:00','2024-06-12','yes','Visveswaraya Seminar Hall (BSB368) - Second Floor','As agriculture is the primary source of water consumption, managing the water allocated for irrigation is crucial. Good efficiencies of irrigation systems are extremely important to reduce soil/open water evaporation, and deep percolation, beyond the rootzone, while maintaining the optimal rootzone water content needed for transpiration to preserve crop yield. Irrigation efficiency is commonly used as a measure for the performance assessment of irrigation systems. To assess the irrigation efficiency accurately, considering the diverse agricultural fields in the study area, it is preferable to determine application efficiency at the field level and then upscale it to the system level. Evapotranspiration (ET) is the primary consumptive use in irrigation, making it essential to precisely estimate actual ET. This research focuses on determining the consumptive water requirement for crops by estimating ET to gain insights into crop water needs. The energy balance model adopted for estimating the actual ET from remotely sensed data is crucial, with factors like complexity, input requirements, and applicability to specific environments. Hence, this study proposes enhancements to the implementation of the existing energy balance algorithms and identifies the best approach for the study region. The primary focus is on calculating field application efficiency, a pivotal component of irrigation efficiency, achieved through accurate estimations of ET and the water diverted to respective fields. To overcome the challenges related to the measurement of water diverted to the fields, this research will adopt calibration and parameterization approaches to use satellite-based ET estimates with an Agro-Hydrological model to estimate irrigation water diverted as a residual of the field water balance. This algorithm integrates ET estimates from both the energy balance model and the Agro-Hydrological model, SWAT, for estimating the irrigation water diverted. In conclusion, this research aims to enhance the implementation of the existing energy balance algorithm over a heterogeneous terrain to better assess irrigation efficiency. \r\n','R.

The Visual Question Answering (VQA) involves selecting only a correct answer for a given image and a question. The VCR task involves not only answer selection but also identification of an appropriate rationale supporting the chosen answer. Traditionally, the VCR models have predominantly relied on visual data for the reasoning process. However, achieving a comprehensive understanding of an image and utilizing it for proper reasoning remains a challenge, as it often requires reasoning beyond the visual cues. We address this issue by using additional information about the input image through its caption for reasoning in the VCR models. First, we explore different fusion techniques to integratecaptions into the existing VCR frameworks. Simple captions of images are typically brief and may not fully capture the contentof an image. To provide more comprehensive information about the image, we propose using a dense caption for the input image for reasoning in the VCR models. We also explore a contrastive learning method for integrating captions into the VCR models. By incorporating the contrastive loss alongside the existing cross-entropy loss, the VCR model can utilize supervision from the caption information before determining the correct answer and reason. This method avoids the need for merging the caption information with the VCR model, as required in the previously proposed approaches. We conducted experiments on the benchmark VCR dataset and observed an improvement in thereasoning performance of the proposed approaches compared to the baseline methods.','Hema G','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-05 06:02:20','Active'),(486,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Water in oil emulsions using steam condensation with applications','Yalla Eswararao (CH16D011) ','Ph.D scholar, Department of Chemical Engineering','Guide: Prof. S.

The design complexity and environmental conditions of offshore structures become susceptible to structural failures due to cracks. The classical structural analysis does not consider cracks explicitly in the design, leading to a high safety factor for accounting uncertainties. The fracture mechanics can be adopted for accounting for cracks, but it requires a knowledge of the initial crack length. The present study implements peridynamic theory in the complex offshore field for studying crack initiation and fracture. The damage is incorporated within governing equations pertained through bond breakage representing structural discontinuity. To begin with, we aim to implement of novel theory by comparing peridynamic deformations under external loading with the classical results. An OC4 jacket structure and tubular joints with T, Y, K, and X configurations are modeled in the peridynamic framework. Thereby implementing peridynamic beam and shell formulation, the deformations due to static, harmonic, and irregular loading are validated. Through the implementation of the peridynamic shell damage model, the damage patterns of floating ice subjected to transverse pressure are validated with the available literature. Subsequently, based on the peridynamic curved shell damage model, a detailed comparative study on different tubular joint configurations is carried out in the peridynamic framework, which includes evaluating the critical location of crack initiation and crack growth path under gradually applied load. Later, the influence of cyclic loading on the damage initiation and fracture load cycles is inferred through the peridynamic fatigue model. The energy-based peridynamic fatigue model for 2D structures is modified to implement on 3D structures, i.e., OC4 jacket with six degrees of freedom, by incorporating energy from shear, bending, torsional, and in-plane deformations. Different load cases from regular waves interacting with the OC4 jacket are generated in the PD framework. Based on the PD cyclic energy release rate model, a comparative study among all load cases on identifying critical damage locations with the failure load cycles is performed for the considered OC4 jacket. In our work, apart from validating the implementation of novel theory in the offshore structure, the drawbacks and intricacies of the classical approach for studying crack initiation and growth in complex tubular joint structures are resolved by the peridynamic approach under cyclic loadings.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING ','oeoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-05 10:13:47','Active'),(489,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of rare earth multicomponent intermetallic compounds RT2 (R = rare earth, T = Al and Ni) and high-entropy alloys','Ms. JESLA P K, (PH18D059)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide: Dr. Nirmala R','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/06/21 15:00','2024-06-21','yes','https://meet.google.com/sfc-tcsx-btp','Efficient magnetic refrigeration requires materials that show large magnetocaloric effect over a wide temperature range.

Having five magnetic heavy rare earth elements at R-site does not alter the crystal structure nor the magnetic ground state of the Laves phases. de Gennes scaling of magnetic transition temperatures, soft-ferromagnetism and optimal magnetocaloric effect including significant refrigerant capacity makes these materials promising for magnetic refrigeration applications, particularly between the liquid hydrogen and liquid nitrogen boiling points.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has implemented the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) as a technical measure to reduce COâ‚‚ emissions from ships and increase their energy efficiency. Newly built vessels are equipped with less-powered engines to meet EEDI requirements. However, it is necessary to understand the maneuvering characteristics of vessels with reduced speed in extreme wave conditions. Both experimental and numerical studies are widely used to capture vessel maneuvering characteristics in calm water and waves. Most previous studies have extensively used a 3DOF mathematical model to predict vessel motions. However, recent research is focusing on a more comprehensive 4DOF mathematical model, which includes roll motion to simulate vessel motion in waves. Despite these advances, experimental results do not always agree with simulations across all wave conditions. Hence, the simulation model needs improvement for better predictions of ship dynamics. In this study, the KRISO Container Ship (KCS) and KVLCC2 research vessels are selected as benchmark vessels for both experimental and numerical analysis. The research focuses on capturing the maneuvering dynamics of the ship at various design speeds and different wave conditions. Additionally, the study aims to ascertain the wave characteristics that might impede a vessel\'s ability to maneuver safely in waves. The wave forces acting on a vessel need to be estimated accurately to simulate the vessel\'s motion in waves. Specifically, the second-order wave drift forces and moments must be calculated precisely to improve the accuracy of numerical simulations. Utilizing the in-house Hydrodynamic Response Analysis (HydRA) simulation tool, this research calculates these forces precisely. The system-based 4DOF Maneuvering Model Group (MMG) mathematical model is employed to predict full-scale maneuvering simulations, with subsequent validation against free-running model experiments.','Department of Ocean Engineering','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-05 11:57:20','Active'),(492,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Interaction of liquid interface with extreme wettability substrate and acoustic waves','Mr. Niladri Sekhar Satpathi, Roll No.ME18D752','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide: Prof. Ashis Kumar Sen, ME, IITM','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/06/13 11:00','2024-06-13','yes','Through Google Meet:  https://meet.google.com/tdn-wycj-aes','','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/tdn-wycj-aes','','',1,'2024-06-05 14:42:22','Active'),(493,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Rolling Contact Fatigue Behaviour of Polyamide 6 Nanocomposite','Mr. Finney Charles.

Here, we dissect the thermo- and osmo-responsory behavior of the transcriptional repressor H-NS (histone-like or heat-stable nucleoid structuring protein), an archetypal nucleoid-condensing sensory protein, ubiquitous in enterobacteria that infect the mammalian gut. Through experiments and thermodynamic modeling, we show that H-NS exhibits osmolarity, temperature, and concentration-dependent self-association, with a highly polydisperse native ensemble dominated by monomers, dimers, tetramers, and octamers. The relative population of these oligomeric states is determined by an interplay between dimerization and higher-order oligomerization, which in turn drives a competition between weak homo- versus hetero-oligomerization of protein-protein and protein-DNA complexes. A phosphomimetic mutation, Y61E, fully eliminates higher-order self-assembly and preserves only dimerization while weakening DNA binding, highlighting that oligomerization is a prerequisite for strong DNA binding. We further demonstrate the presence of long-distance thermodynamic connectivity between dimerization and oligomerization sites on H-NS which influences the binding of the co-repressor Cnu, and switches the DNA binding mode of the hetero-oligomeric H-NS: Cnu complex. Additionally, H-NS forms liquid-like condensates in the presence of DNA. We show that multivalent interactions arising from oligomerization and low complexity regions and, heterotypic intermolecular interactions play an important role in H-NS phase separation. Our work thus uncovers important organizational principles that act at different length scales in H-NS and provides a molecular framework that could be applicable to other proteins belonging to the H-NS family.','BT OFFICE','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/whw-oxde-rre','','',1,'2024-06-06 05:43:28','Active'),(498,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','\"Modelling and Analysis of Queueing Systems with Multiple Classes of Customersâ€ ','Mr. Vinay Kumar, MA17D025','Research Scholar, Department of Mathematics','DC Members: Dr. R.

Six different plain concrete mixes have been developed. Eighteen double-notched concrete prisms were tested under direct shear loading. The ultimate shear strength increases with increasing the compressive strength of concrete up to (fck) 62.50 MPa and remains constant beyond 70.23 MPa. The fracture toughness of concrete increases proportionately with increase in the compressive strength of concrete up to 62 MPa.\r\nIn normal and high strength SFRC, experiments were carried out with different volume fractions (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%) of 4D hooked-end steel fibres of length 30mm and 0.55mm diameter under Mode-II loading. Twenty-four double-notched prisms were tested. The normal strength concrete exhibits higher shear strength than high strength concrete. Addition of fibres improves the shear strength and shear toughness. The improvement has been significant at higher fibre dosages (Vf = 1.5%). In NSC, 1.5% fibres increase the ultimate shear strength while in HSC, adding 1.0% and 1.5% fibres increases the ultimate shear strength.\r\nThe compressive strength, water permeability, and oxygen permeability, and rapid chloride penetration (RCP) of various ternary blended concretes using various cementitious and water content have been investigated.

Implementation of Low Impact Development (LID) measures in this context has proven its effectiveness in regulating stormwater runoff at its source of generation. LID measures rely on the principles of sustainability that restore the ecosystem functions and provide resilience to the adverse effects of urban flooding. The impact assessment of LID measures at large spatial scales (such as on a river basin scale) is currently limited due to the absence of hydrological tools based on detailed physical processes. LID simulations at river basin scales also require hydrological models that can account for the spatial heterogeneities in the basin characteristics. To improve the existing LID modelling frameworks, this study attempts to develop LID simulation modules using the physics-based Multi-Layer Green-Ampt (MLGA) infiltration method for river basin scale LID planning and implementation.\r\nThe performance of LID modules based on MLGA was evaluated using the numerically intensive tool HYDRUS 1D for various soil conditions and the results showed that the MLGA-based formulation was able to capture the LID processes with good accuracy and fewer computational efforts. The comparison of LID modules with the widely used Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) indicated that the MLGA-based simulations were closer to the numerical simulations from HYDRUS. The LID modules developed based on MLGA were further used for conducting an optimization-simulation analysis to determine the optimal LID measures that are most suitable for the hydrologically similar sub-basins present in a large river basin. The results indicated that within the impervious areas present in the sub-basins, LID measures are capable of reducing runoff volume between 38% and 82%, and runoff peak between 37% and 75%. The effectiveness of LID measures when translated to the basin scale was found to differ depending on the percentage of imperviousness in the sub-basins. For sub-basins with higher imperviousness, higher runoff reductions were observed and for sub-basins with lower percentage of imperviousness runoff reductions in the range of 2-30% were observed. The MLGA-based LID modules were also integrated into the sub-routines of the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for a basin scale assessment. The LID impact assessment conducted for the study area, Adyar River basin (830 km2), was shown to reduce the surface runoff by 12% and increase the aquifer recharge by 14% at the basin scale when optimal LID measures were implemented. The results were consistent with the inferences from the optimization-simulation analyses conducted at the basin scale. Hence, the study provides insights into the effectiveness of the LID measures and their implementation scales required for achieving runoff quantity control while adhering to the land developmental rules and regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n','R.

The forestry and tourism industries, which rely on natural ecosystems and landscapes, are two of the most severely impacted. Though some studies look at the impact of climate change on tourist behaviour, tourism trends, and the physical impact of climate change on destinations, little is known about the psychological effects of climate change on employees in these industries. This research aims to create a framework for studying forest and tourism employees\' climate emotions in the Western Ghats forestry and tourism industry. The Western Ghats region in India, renowned for its rich biodiversity and drawing many tourists, is undergoing environmental change mainly due to human activities. \r\nAn exploratory sequential mixed methods approach will be adopted to address the following research questions: (1) What are the climate emotions experienced by employees in the forestry and tourism industries in Western Ghats, and why do they experience these emotions? (2) What underlying factors contribute to the experience of specific climate emotions among employees in the forestry and tourism industry in the Western Ghats? And (3) How can employee climate emotions benefit organizations?\r\nThe study will be conducted in three phases. In the first phase, a literature review through a morphological analysis will be undertaken to identify and understand the existing research on climate emotions in the forestry and tourism industries. In the second phase, semi-structured interviews will be conducted among tourism and forestry employees in the Western Ghats to collect qualitative data on their emotional experiences related to climate change. The interviews will also explore the factors that influence their emotional experiences. In the third phase, a survey will be conducted among forestry and tourism employees in the Western Ghats region to collect quantitative data on their emotional experiences related to climate change. The survey will also collect their demographic information, environmental identity, climate change awareness and green-value co-creation. \r\nThis study seeks to advance our knowledge of the psychological effects of climate change on forestry and tourism workers in the Western Ghats. The study will aid in developing a framework for measuring and comprehending climate emotions that will account for the area\'s distinctive social, cultural, and economic settings. The study will also shed light on the employees\' emotional experiences and the factors affecting their emotional reactions to environmental change. The study\'s conclusions could be applied to management and policy decisions to promote the well-being of forestry and tourist workers in the face of climate change and their participation in pro-environmental tourism. It will aid academia in shifting from descriptive problem-based discourse to a more comprehensive discourse on how businesses can align and contribute to the international community\'s sustainability goals (e.g., the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals). \r\n\r\nKeywords: climate emotions, climate change, green value co-creation, environmental identity\r\n\r\n\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','RESEARCH PROPOSAL SEMINAR-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-07 10:41:42','Active'),(507,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Development of Hybrid Model and Stress Mitigation Techniques for Cylindrical contacts','Mr.Pullak Pradhan (AE18D006)','Ph.D Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','Prof. H.S.N.Murthy - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/06/10 15:00','2024-06-10','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/dou-ooic-bvm ','','',1,'2024-06-07 11:44:53','Active');

One of the main challenges in implementing IBFD is dealing with the Self-Interference (SI) caused by the powerful transmit signal onto the receive signal.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will provide a detailed theoretical analysis of phase-based RF cancellation. We will discuss the lower bound on the residual signal after multi-stage cancellation and derive the upper bound on the self-interference cancellation (SIC) across an RF channel, considering factors such as group delay and amplitude imbalance between the cancelling signals. Our model demonstrates improved accuracy of SIC compared to existing literature and highlights the enhanced convergence time of the canceller loop compared to the classical multi-tap RF canceller.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of the talk, we will introduce the concept of a â€œSpectral shaperâ€ circuit that mimics the SI signal and significantly improves the SIC. We will describe the RF front-end architecture of the proposed canceller and its implementation on a two-layer PCB at 2.45 GHz using COTS components. The performance of the canceller was analyzed under various practical conditions, and the results will be discussed. The proto-model of the canceller was able to suppress a +27 dBm transmit signal by 70.8 dB over a 20 MHz channel exclusively in the RF domain. Towards the end, we will discuss the over-the-air (OTA) measurements conducted using the proposed RF transceiver and conclude the talk by drawing a direct comparison with the state-of-the-art.','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/nkv-bgoc-jpz','','',1,'2024-06-10 03:20:47','Active'),(509,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Ultrasound reforms droplets','Mr. Lokesh Malik, ME19D754','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department to Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide Name â€“ Prof. Ashis Kumar Sen, ME /\r\nDC Members â€“ Prof. Balaji Srinivasan (Mech.

Remarkably, we introduce a continuous flow acoustomicrofluidics technique which enables simultaneous trapping-coalescence-splitting of droplets to reform existing polydisperse emulsion into size-controlled droplets with improved monodispersity. In contrast to conventional approaches, our platform enables controlling droplet characteristics in-situ by regulating acoustic power without altering hydrodynamical parameters thereby improving response time and facilitates continuous nozzle-less clogging-free droplet generation from a liquid plug in a chamber instead from a liquid stream at a narrow junction. The technique can process polydisperse droplets produced not only due to fluid-source fluctuations or unstable jetting regime but also externally by non-microfluidic or simple setups. Distinctively, our platform is amenable to continuous mixing of inhomogeneous droplets, offering monodisperse mixed-sample droplets, and holds the potential to match current throughput standards through suitable design modifications.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps:// https://meet.google.com/its-ntwk-xjz','','',1,'2024-06-10 04:13:48','Active'),(510,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Ripple Cancellation Techniques for Switching DC-DC Converters','Mr. Guddanti Sivasai (EE18S053)','MS scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Qadeer Khan ','Electrical Engineering','2024/06/11 11:00','2024-06-11','yes','Googlemeet','\r\n\r\nA switching regulator offers excellent efficiency but suffers from output voltage ripple which renders it unsuitable for noise-sensitive applications such as analog and RF. Prior ripple reduction techniques such as multi-phase converter and LDO followed by switching converter have their own drawbacks and limitations. State-of-the-art active ripple cancellation technique uses parallel inductive path which is 180 degree out of phase and ac coupled to inject equal and opposite ripple current. However, this technique suffers from poor performance due to inductor mismatch and loop instability which makes them practically unusable. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis work presents a novel control technique to cancel the effect of mismatch between inductors and achieve perfect ripple cancellation without compromising the loop stability. Inductor mismatch is compensated by calibrating the ripple cancellation path supply voltage using high precision ripple detection techniques. Proposed split PWM controller solves the loop instability by generating inverted PWM for the ripple cancellation path using only integral (slow) component from the PID control. Transient response can also be improved using the same ripple cancellation path with slight modifications to the split PWM controller. Designed in TSMC 180nm CMOS process for 1.8V input voltage, 0.8V to 1.2V output voltage and load current up to 0.6A; the prototype converter occupies an active area of 0.825mm^2 and operates at 1.8MHz switching frequency achieves output voltage ripple of 1mV for 20% inductor mismatch with peak efficiency of 92.9% which is a ripple reduction of 13x.\r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link  https://meet.google.com/hem-yoou-cxg','','',1,'2024-06-10 04:36:31','Active'),(511,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Study of Flow Reversal in Rayleigh BÃ©nard Convection in Jet-A fluid with Non-Oberbeck - Boussinesq Effect','Mr. Egambaravel J (AM14D012)','Ph.

For such high Prandtl number flows, 2D numerical analysis is carried out as the predicted global parameters closely match the corresponding 3D DNS.

Non-dimensional temperature, velocities and wall normal temperature gradients are tracked transiently. The non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq code requires an update of fluid properties at every time step. Hence, properties of the working fluid are defined as a polynomial function of temperature for time-step marching. The boundary layer thicknesses based on slope method, the centre line temperature, standard and cessation Flow reversals and the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition modes are reported. The power spectral density (PSD) of temperature and velocities are plotted, and it is observed that the velocities follow the Bolgiano-Obukhov scaling.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','Keywords: Jet-A; flow reversal; Rayleigh BÃ©nard; non-Oberbeck Boussinesq; large scale circulation; ','','',1,'2024-06-10 05:33:06','Active'),(512,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL',' Design, Development, and Testing of Navigated Instruments for Image-Guided Spine Surgery','Mr. Nivash Kumar (EE21S071)','MS Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Mohanasankar S','Electrical Engineering','2024/06/14 14:15','2024-06-14','yes','Online (Googlemeet)','Image-Guided Spine Surgery (IGSS) aims to improve surgical outcomes through precise navigation and real-time tracking of instruments. However, critical challenges such as plastic deformation of instruments during use and Near-InfraRed (NIR) light reflections can cause tracking inaccuracies, compromising the accuracy and effectiveness of surgical procedures. Additionally, closed implant systems and line-of-sight issues limit the surgeonâ€™s flexibility in selecting implants specific to patient needs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo overcome these challenges, the Navigated Pilot-Hole Creation Instrument (NPHCI) and a Universal Accessory (UA) have been developed. These instruments utilize Stainless Steel 17-4 PH, hardened according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) A564/A564M-19a standards, to resist plastic deformation and ensure biocompatibility. Surface finishing techniques such as sandblasting and electropolishing reduce NIR interference, providing a matte finish with enhanced corrosion resistance in the clinical environment. To increase flexibility for surgeons in implant placement, the UA features a radially symmetrical collet chuck mechanism with one revolute joint, reducing dependency on closed implant systems. This allows various manufacturers\' implant-dependent, non-navigated instruments to be converted into navigated instruments, thereby increasing options for surgeons and reducing line-of-sight issues.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe performance of the NPHCI and UA was evaluated according to ASTM F2554-22 in phantom studies, and their reliability and effectiveness were tested through cadaveric studies.

However, the photon losses in the circuit was found to be very high. Therefore, loss reduction and compact design of a photonic integrated circuit is essential for implementing boson sampling. Moreover, photon indistinguishability and amount of squeezing are other important metrics to ensure the quantumness of the interference in the unitary circuit.\r\n\r\nIn this seminar, we will discuss boson sampling fundamentals and its recent implementations using silicon photonics technology platform.

ATI-425 is being studied for\r\napplications such as armour, aerospace (fracture critical airframes), chemical process\r\nindustry components, heat exchangers, and pressure vessels. Since ATI-425 is a\r\nrecently developed alloy, thermo-mechanical processing (TMP) parameters must be\r\noptimized to obtain the desired microstructure, mechanical properties, and corrosion\r\nresistance.\r\nThe present thesis reports the optimum processing conditions for primary hot\r\nworking (consisting of ingot-breakdown in Î²-field and sub-transus processing) of ATI-\r\n425 Ti alloy obtained through the hot deformation studies conducted on samples in a)\r\nas-cast and homogenized and b) Î²-worked conditions. Hot deformation characteristics\r\nof Ti-4Al-2.5V-1.5Fe-0.25O alloy in as-cast and homogenized conditions were studied\r\nusing isothermal hot compression tests in Î² and Î±+Î² fields at strain rates ranging from\r\n3Ã—10-4s-1to 1 s-1. To understand the hot deformation behaviour during primary ingot-\r\nbreak down and to identify the optimum regime for the primary breakdown of Ti alloy\r\ningot, a processing map based on strain rate sensitivity (m), kinetic analysis, and\r\nmicrostructural characterization were used. Micro-mechanisms of deformation in the\r\nÎ²-field were identified with the help of parent Î² grain orientation reconstruction using\r\nelectron backscatter diffraction data. Kinetic analysis and microstructural examination\r\nof samples deformed at low strain rates (ÎµÌ‡ < 10-2 s-1) in Î²-field confirmed dynamic\r\nrecovery assisted by dislocation glide/climb. In comparison, the samples deformed at\r\nhigher strain rates (ÎµÌ‡ > 10-2 s-1) in Î²-field exhibited deformation bands, and the\r\nrecrystallized grains formed through static recrystallization. In the Î±+Î² field, the\r\ncalculated kinetic parameters at low strain rates (ÎµÌ‡ < 10-2 s-1) indicated dynamic globurization, which was also corroborated by microstructural analysis. Samples\r\ndeformed at high strain rates (ÎµÌ‡ > 10-2 s-1) in the Î±+Î² field exhibited adiabatic shear\r\nbands, strain-induced porosity and lamellar Î±-kinking. The optimum regime for primary\r\ningot breakdown was identified as 900oC to 1150oC and 3x10-4s-1to 3x10-2s-1\r\nfrom the analysis of the strain rate sensitivity map and microstructure. Further, constitutive\r\nequations have been developed to predict the steady-state flow stress values in Î² and\r\nÎ±+Î² fields during primary ingot breakdown.\r\nAfter identifying the optimum processing regime for ingot breakdown of as-cast\r\nmaterial, the hot deformation behaviour of ATI-425 alloy in primary Î²-worked\r\ncondition during sub-transus processing (at a temperature range of 750 ÌŠC-950 ÌŠC and\r\nstrain rate range of 3Ã—10-4s-1 to 1 s-1) was studied. The strain rate sensitivity-based\r\nprocessing map, kinetic analysis and microstructural characterization were used to\r\nunderstand the hot deformation behaviour during sub-transus processing. The samples\r\ndeformed at high temperatures and low strain rate conditions resulted in high m values\r\n(m > 0.3). In contrast, low m values (< 0.15) were observed for samples deformed at\r\nlow temperatures and high strain rate conditions. Kinetic analysis indicates that\r\ndislocation glide and climb was the primary rate-controlling deformation mechanism in\r\nthe Î±+Î² field. At high temperatures and low strain rates (850Â°Câ€“ 950Â°C; 3x10âˆ’4sâˆ’110âˆ’2sâˆ’1), dynamic globurization of Î± was the dominant microstructural mechanism,\r\nwhereas kinking of Î±-lamellae was ascertained as the dominant mechanism at low\r\ntemperatures and high-strain rate conditions (750Â°C-850Â°C; 10âˆ’2sâˆ’1to 1 sâˆ’1). Due tothe higher Î² phase stability, ATI-425 Ti alloy provides an opportunity to study the\r\nmicrostructural and microtexture evolution of the Î² phase at temperatures < 800 ÌŠC in\r\nÎ±+Î² field without the need for parent Î² reconstruction from product Î±-orientations. The\r\npresent results indicate that dynamic recovery and continuous dynamic recrystallization\r\ncontrol the microstructural evolution of the Î² phase at low strain rates (3Ã—10-4s-1â€“ 10-2s-1). In contrast, bending and thinning of the Î² phase dominate at high strain rates (10-2s-1â€“ 1s-1).\r\nAnalysis of the strain rate sensitivity map and microstructural characterization\r\nindicates that the optimum regime for breaking lamellar-Î± into globurized-Î± is between\r\n850Â°C to 900Â°C in the strain rate range of 3ï‚´10âˆ’4sâˆ’1to 10âˆ’2sâˆ’1. However, analysis of\r\nthe orientation data from the mid-region of the selected compression-tested samples\r\n(corresponding to high and low â€˜mâ€™ values) indicates the formation of strong-Î± texture,\r\nwhere {0001}// RD (radial direction) and {112Ì…0} //CD (compression direction) and in\r\naddition, the formation of macrozones were also observed. The present work\r\nemphasizes the need to understand both the macro and microtexture evolution (along\r\nwith microstructural evolution) during sub-transus processing to arrive at optimum\r\nprocessing conditions for secondary processing, which will produce a macrozone-free\r\nfinal product.\r\nThough ATI-425 Ti alloy is primarily intended for armour applications, limited\r\nballistic results are available in the open literature. The present work compares the\r\nquasi-static, dynamic deformation, ballistic impact response and post-deformation\r\nmicrostructure of ATI-425 with that of Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Analysis of the results showed\r\nthat both alloys had similar yield strength values during quasi-static tension and\r\ncompression tests, while ATI-425 Ti alloy showed higher tensile ductility, Charpy-V\r\nnotch impact energy and dynamic flow stress than Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The ATI-425 Ti\r\nalloy also exhibited slightly better ballistic performance measured in terms of V50\r\nballistic limit velocity. Detailed microstructural analysis on quasi-static and dynamic\r\ncompression-tested samples showed mainly {101Ì…2} tensile twins, whereas {101Ì…2} and\r\n{112Ì…1} tensile twins were observed in ballistic-tested samples of both alloys.\r\nActivation of deformation twinning in ATI-425 Ti alloy with higher oxygen is\r\nattributed to lower Al content, which enhances the twinning activity.

This study discerns the nature of the interaction between the city-states of Kozhikode(present-day Calicut), Kollam (present-day Quilon) and Kochi (present-day Cochin) and China and assesses the nature of inter-state ties and formation of state preferences as a consequence of the iterated interaction by different dynasties in China that attempted maritime outreach in these parts of Kerala. The findings are important in cataloguing the diplomatic history of interaction between the two regions. In doing so, the study gathers information regarding the material conditions of interaction between Kerala and China from locally available resources, primarily archival and literary sources, specifically relating to Chinaâ€™s maritime outreach to Kozhikode, Kollam and Kochi from the 12th to the mid-15th century A.D. This research extricates new dimensions to the historical connection between Kerala and China. It does so by using local historical Malayalam literary sources, besides also comparing similar information from Chinese historical sources around the same period. Historical studies provide surmises to be integrated into International Relations beyond just the information and the study of the past. It is hoped that by delving into the past some of the findings herein would contribute to a wider and more clear understanding of the present. Besides examination of literary sources, the study also highlights physical sites, artefacts and place-names (besides known ones) based on local fieldwork that reveal the historical connection of some of these places with Imperial China (CÄ«na).\r\n\r\nKeywords: Medieval Keralaâ€“ Imperial China - Maritime Connections â€“ Constructivism â€“ Microhistory','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/idw-vnmb-yyh','','',1,'2024-06-10 08:58:23','Active'),(520,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Policy Gradient Algorithms for Sequential Decision Making under Uncertainty and Risk','Ms. Nithia V, Roll No: CS17D003','Ph.D. Research Scholar','Dr. Prashanth L A - Guide','Computer Science and Engineering','2024/06/20 10:30','2024-06-20','','By Google Meet','We consider the problem of sequential decision making under uncertainty and risk. Our objective is to propose and analyze novel algorithms that utilize the Markov decision process (MDP) framework for modeling the problem, facilitating the learning of policies that cater to both risk-neutral and risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) settings, respectively. More specifically, we propose novel algorithms that leverage the policy gradient framework to learn parameterized stochastic policies by optimizing an objective function, which governs the type of policies to be learned, viz., risk-neutral or risk-sensitive.\r\n\r\nLearning risk-neutral policies involves utilizing the expected value of the cumulative discounted reward as the objective function. We propose two policy gradient algorithms that incorporate a smoothed-functional (SF) based gradient estimation scheme to optimize the expected value in an off-policy RL context. The first algorithm combines importance sampling-based off-policy evaluation with SF-based gradient estimation. The second algorithm, inspired by the stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithm, incorporates variance reduction in the update iteration. Our non-asymptotic analysis establishes the convergence of our algorithms to an approximate stationary point. Our first algorithm demonstrates a convergence rate comparable to an off-policy adaptation of the well-known REINFORCE algorithm, which employs a gradient estimation scheme based on the likelihood ratio (LR) method. In contrast, our second algorithm, which incorporates variance reduction, exhibits an improved rate of convergence as compared to REINFORCE.\r\n\r\nLearning risk-sensitive policies involves utilizing a risk measure of the cumulative discounted reward as the objective function. Initially, we consider optimizing a family of risk measures called distortion risk measures (DRM). A DRM utilizes a distortion function to alter the original distribution, and determine the mean of the rewards with respect to the distorted distribution. We propose and analyze novel policy gradient algorithms that support both on-policy and off-policy RL settings, respectively. Our algorithms utilize LR-based and SF-based gradient estimation schemes, respectively. Subsequently, we generalize the policy gradient algorithms that employ an SF-based gradient estimation scheme to encompass the broad class of smooth risk measures (SRM). Optimization of the SRM is highly valuable since a wide variety of risk measures, including DRM and mean-variance risk measure (MVRM), can be categorized as an SRM under generally applicable conditions. In contrast to DRM, which distorts the distribution, MVRM utilizes the variance to model the risk related to the cumulative reward, and guarantees a trade-off between the mean and the variance of the cumulative reward. To optimize SRM, we develop template policy gradient algorithms that employ an SF-based gradient estimation scheme. Specifically, we demonstrate that our algorithms are applicable to the optimization of MVRM and DRM. Despite obtaining biased estimates of the risk measure, in contrast to the unbiased estimates of the expected value, our risk-sensitive algorithms maintain a convergence rate comparable to that of risk-neutral algorithms.','CS Office','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/kaa-pnzi-nvx','','',1,'2024-06-10 11:10:14','Active'),(521,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','   From Hough transform to spherical indexing: Principles and applications of EBSD pattern analysis','Prof. Stefan Zaefferer','Prof. Stefan Zaefferer obtained his PhD from University of Clausthal.

However, traditional endoscopes with a single image sensor cannot provide the necessary depth information.\r\n \r\nThis work discusses the design and development of a stereo endoscopy system that uses a dual camera setup for accurate depth estimation. It discusses the design challenges of creating a stereo endoscopy system and outlines effective strategies to address them. A prototype was developed, including an endoscope, a video processor that connects to a display monitor, and a Virtual Reality-enabled Head Mounted Display Device for enhanced 3-D visualization.\r\n \r\nAdditionally, this research proposes a new algorithm using a pre-trained Visual Geometry Group Network (VGGNet) model for estimating disparities and accurately measuring the size of abnormal tissues like polyps or lesions.

DACVNet demonstrated superior performance over ACVNet and other models by reducing the End Point Error by 7.08%.

Despite its versatility, MRI remains the secondary choice owing to its lengthy scanning durations. However, the undersampling leads to aliasing artifacts in the acquired image due to sub-Nyquist sampling, and a diagnostic quality image must be reconstructed. Conventional methods like compressive sensing (CS-MRI) methods involve non-linear optimization solvers with iterative computations and repeated hyperparameter tweaking resulting in longer reconstruction time. Secondly, MRI offers diverse and complementary perspectives of the organ of interest to aid radiologists in better diagnosis. \r\n\r\n\r\nRecent research has seen a surge in using deep learning models for various imaging tasks to develop efficient MR imaging workflows at every stage, right from acquisition to patient-specific longitudinal analysis. Our research aims to develop robust deep learning techniques to expedite and enhance reconstruction quality. However, contemporary deep learning methods require retraining for each acquisition setting, posing a substantial barrier to applying deep learning methods for clinicians and radiologists to configure imaging workflows due to a lack of resources or machine learning expertise to train models at workstations. Consequently, our objectives extend to identifying clinical scenarios involving data diversity, designing adaptive models that can tune to different acquisition settings, and making these models applicable to different MR imaging tasks. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe have developed improved adaptive reconstruction methods based on dynamic weight prediction at the architecture level and enhanced meta-learning methods at the optimization levels to achieve high representation capacity to adapt to varying acquisition contexts without retraining and expense in quality. The various scenarios include multiple acquisition contexts combining multiple anatomies under study, under sampling patterns, acceleration factors, multiple coil configurations and multiple contrasts in MRI reconstruction. Our analyses encompass exploring various meta-learning variants, configurations of acquisition contexts, task-level and instance-level model abstractions, explainable model methodologies, and frequency perspectives, incorporating supervised and physics-driven self-supervised learning approaches. \r\n\r\n\r\nExtensive experimentation validates our adaptive methods, demonstrating significant reductions in retraining requirements, alongside improvements in reconstruction quality compared to previous deep learning models, adaptive methods, and baseline meta-learning models. Our code is publicly available in a shared repository.

Time-resolved high-speed shadow imaging technique is used to image the spray droplets in the intersecting region of the sprays from the adjacent injector elements. The spray droplet images are captured at different axial positions relative to the injectorsâ€™ exit, at Z = 3dg, 5dg, 7dg, and 9dg, where dg represents the diameter of the gas orifice. At each location, droplet size distribution, axial and radial components of droplet velocity, and droplet number density are measured. The results are presented for a range of gas-to-liquid momentum flux ratios, M = 30 - 80. In addition, the radial profiles of different droplet properties have also been taken at Z = 5dg location. Mie-scattering images of the spray are also captured using the laser sheet imaging (LSI) technique. The characteristic droplet size and two-component droplet velocity in the interacting sprays are compared with those of the individual sprays. It is observed that the interacting sprays exhibit a trend of axial reduction in the characteristic droplet size in contrast to the individual spray, where droplet size does not vary much in the axial direction. Additionally, the mean axial velocity component is always higher when the multiple sprays interact in comparison to the individual sprays, while the mean radial velocity is smaller for the former. The above observations are attributed to physical phenomena in spray interaction effects such as droplet-to-droplet collisions, secondary breakup of droplets, and droplet dispersion.  Contrary to the intuitive perception that droplet collisions dominate spray interactions in intersecting sprays, it has been found that the modification of airflow characteristics is the primary factor governing the resulting spray behavior.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/bmp-deoj-sck','','',1,'2024-06-11 11:46:35','Active'),(531,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','A modeling framework for performance assessment of irrigation system at river basin scale using Remote sensing-based evapotranspiration and hydrologic crop growth models','Ms. Noufia M A, Roll No: CE20D090','Ph.D Scholar','Dr. Balaji Narasimhan - Guide, Dr. Venkatraman Srinivasan - DC Member, Dr. Subbarao Pichuka - DC Member, Dr. Chakravarthy Balaji (ME) - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael -Chairperson & Head CE','Civil Engineering','2024/06/12 11:00','2024-06-12','yes','BSB 104 (Conference Room)','As agriculture is the primary source of water consumption, managing the water allocated for irrigation is crucial. Good efficiencies of irrigation systems are extremely important to reduce soil/open water evaporation, and deep percolation, beyond the rootzone, while maintaining the optimal rootzone water content needed for transpiration to preserve crop yield. Irrigation efficiency is commonly used as a measure for the performance assessment of irrigation systems. To assess the irrigation efficiency accurately, considering the diverse agricultural fields in the study area, it is preferable to determine application efficiency at the field level and then upscale it to the system level. Evapotranspiration (ET) is the primary consumptive use in irrigation, making it essential to precisely estimate actual ET. This research focuses on determining the consumptive water requirement for crops by estimating ET to gain insights into crop water needs. The energy balance model adopted for estimating the actual ET from remotely sensed data is crucial, with factors like complexity, input requirements, and applicability to specific environments. Hence, this study proposes enhancements to the implementation of the existing energy balance algorithms and identifies the best approach for the study region. The primary focus is on calculating field application efficiency, a pivotal component of irrigation efficiency, achieved through accurate estimations of ET and the water diverted to respective fields. To overcome the challenges related to the measurement of water diverted to the fields, this research will adopt calibration and parameterization approaches to use satellite-based ET estimates with an Agro-Hydrological model to estimate irrigation water diverted as a residual of the field water balance. This algorithm integrates ET estimates from both the energy balance model and the Agro-Hydrological model, SWAT, for estimating the irrigation water diverted. In conclusion, this research aims to enhance the implementation of the existing energy balance algorithm over a heterogeneous terrain to better assess irrigation efficiency.\r\n','R.

The airborne transmission of respiratory droplets has been established as a primary source of pathogen dissemination. Thus, a thorough investigation into the dynamics of the gas cloud carrying these droplets becomes crucial. To address this, the concept of an artificial cough simulator has been proposed as it ensures a controlled and safe environment, allowing for repeatability and disinfection measures. This study aims to investigate the transport of droplets ejected from an artificial cough simulator, which releases a turbulent puff of droplets into the surrounding air, closely resembling the human coughing process. The current research delves into the less-explored aspect of the collective evaporation of clouds or clusters of droplets on droplet transport. Previous works underscored the significance of droplet evaporation time in infection spread, yet the impact of group evaporation remains understudied. The notion of collective behavior of droplets, akin to group combustion in fuel spray combustion, introduces the Group number, ðº. This non-dimensional parameter characterizes the extent of evaporation of clouds of droplets, with implications for respiratory droplet dynamics. Anticipating that group evaporation could enhance the evaporation time scale of saliva droplets during respiratory events, this study aims to contribute insights into this complex phenomenon. Different laser diagnostic tools are employed to characterize the droplets and clusters The Laser Sheet Imaging (LSI) technique is employed in conjunction with a high-speed camera to visualize the Mie-scattering images of the droplets. Furthermore, the droplet velocity is measured using the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) algorithm applied to time-resolved LSI images. Phase-locked droplet size measurements are obtained using the Interferometric Laser Imaging for Droplet Sizing (ILIDS) technique. The characterization of the droplet clusters is achieved by the application of Voronoi analysis to PIV images of the spray droplets. This approach not only identifies the droplet clusters but also provides area, length scale, and local droplet number density within the clusters. Accordingly, the group number is evaluated for individual droplet clusters. In addition, the droplet evaporation rate in the droplet clusters is estimated by involving a suitable model. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in the droplet evaporation rate due to collective evaporation of droplets in clusters, and this effect was prominent for higher injection pressure. The implication of the above is a longer residence time of the droplets in the air, which is known to promote infection.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/qda-zhwm-rmh','','',1,'2024-06-12 04:32:51','Active'),(535,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL',' â€œMolecular Engineering of Aromatic Redox Shuttles and their Application in Organic Redox Flow Batteries and Metal-Ion Batteriesâ€ ','Ms. Priya V (CY18D106)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide- Prof. Sankararaman S, Department of Chemistry, Co-Guide-Prof. Kothandaraman R, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/06/13 16:00','2024-06-13','yes','Online-Google Meet','','CY OFFICE','cyoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','ALL ARE WELCOME-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/apn-keaq-pjm','','',1,'2024-06-12 05:04:41','Active'),(536,'seminar','Seminar Cancellation','NULL',' Investigations of lead-free ferroelectrics for energy-related applications','Ms. SHANMUGA PRIYA K, (PH17D202)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide: Dr. Murugavel P','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/06/13 15:00','2024-06-13','','HSB-209, Seminar Hall, Department of Physics, IIT Madras ','Ferroelectric materials exhibit application potentials in the field of photovoltaic (PV), photodetector, pyro-energy harvesting, and energy storage.

Over-excited synchronous motors are conventionally used in LCI drives since a leading power factor is a mandatory requirement for LCI operation. The synchronous motor can be replaced by an induction motor to obtain several additional benefits, provided the leading power factor requirement is satisfied by some means.\r\n\r\nThe thesis  presents a new topology of an LCI and VSI fed multi-phase induction motor drive specifically suited for high-power medium-voltage applications. The proposed configuration has superior features like smooth generated torque, reduced machine size, reduced losses, and high system reliability which make the drive a fitting competent for medium voltage high power applications. The  LCI and VSI fault tolerance algorithms are developed for the proposed drive configuration which highly enhances the system reliability and makes the drive suitable for critical  high power applications   Further, a VSI-assisted PWM CSI technique is proposed which reduces the low-frequency torque oscillations in a 6-pulse LCI-fed drive and offers a smooth torque profile in the entire operating regions. The thesis also proposes a novel Square Wave Mode (SWM) control scheme for a high power induction machine based traction drive. The proposed method adopts a single control variable based SWM scheme that addresses the limitation of the conventional Field Oriented Control (FOC) method to effectively operate the drive in SWM.

The diffuser of a centrifugal compressor is one of the most significant components, as its flow behavior impacts the compressors overall performance. The vaneless diffuser is easier to maintain and manufacture than the vaned diffuser, yet vaned diffusers are employed in centrifugal compressors to obtain a higher-pressure rise. The operating range of the centrifugal compressor is limited by the use of a vaned diffuser. The discussion will therefore mostly center on cutting-edge diffuser designs developed in recent research works to enhance compressor performance and stable operating range.

Strain tuning of magnetic interactions in rare-earth cobaltates and nickelatesare is of central importance due to their unique electronic transport properties [1]. In rare-earth cobaltates such as LaCoO3 (LCO), Co3+ can exhibit temperature-dependent spin state transitions due to multiple spin degrees of freedom, namely low spin (LS) state, intermediate spin (IS) state and high spin (HS) state [2]. Rare-earth nickelates, on the other hand, are known to exhibit metal-insulator transitions associated with complex antiferromagnetic ground states owing to the charge disproportionation among the adjacent Ni ions in the octahedral environment [3]. The present thesis work reports on the role of Co spin-state transitions in tuning the magnetic interactions between Co, Ni and rare-earth ions in (La,Pr)Co0.5Ni0.5O3âˆ’Î´ thin films and realizing novel functionalities in these disordered rare-earth perovskites. In LaCo0.5Ni0.5O3âˆ’Î´ thin films, we have investigated the temperature-dependent switching of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) around the ferromagnetic ordering temperature of 50 K [4]. Below 50 K, we see a subtle change in the magnetization dynamics, which breaks the long-range order, introducing glassiness in the system. Further, we explored the 3d - 4f antiferromagnetic exchange interactions and low-temperature spin re-orientations in PrCo0.5Ni0.5O3âˆ’Î´ thin films using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Pr M4,5 and Co / Ni L2,3 absorption edges under tensile and compressive strain environments [5]. Comparative studies of (La,Pr)Co0.5Ni0.5O3âˆ’Î´ thin films on various substrates show the influence of biaxial strain in tuning the magnetotransport in the system.\r\nReferences\r\n[1]\r\nFang, Z. and K.

However, these refrigerants are flammable, which imposes restrictions on the amount of refrigerant to be charged into a system. Microchannel heat exchangers (MCHX) can be seen as a possible solution to reduce the refrigerant charge, due to their high compactness and smaller liquid hold-up compared to traditional Tube and Fin Heat Exchangers (TFHX). Accurate methods are required to evaluate the performance of an MCHX, as several phenomena such as longitudinal heat conduction in tube walls, transverse heat conduction between tubes through fins, and flow maldistribution are involved. Different methodologies have been used in the literature to simulate the performance of the MCHXs. Most of the methodologies neglect the heat conduction between flat tubes, i.e., transverse heat conduction through fins. Transverse heat conduction can be significant in cases like desuperheating and subcooling in condensers, cooling of CO2 in gas coolers, etc., where high temperature differences between tube walls may arise, resulting in heat conduction between the flat tubes. \r\nA computer program is developed in this work to rate an MCHX using five rating methods, including a method that considers transverse heat conduction. The methods are validated using experimental data available in the literature and compared based on the accuracy of heat capacity estimation.

A typical DSTATCOM includes passive filter components, a voltage source converter (VSC), and DC-link capacitors. Proper design of these components is necessary for getting good performances from the DSTATCOM. Hysteresis current control is normally used due to its simplicity in implementation, good dynamic response, and inherent peak current limiting capability. But this control scheme has a variable switching frequency. In a variable switching frequency control scheme, it is challenging to design the VSC parameters without knowing the maximum and minimum switching frequencies. In this research work, a detailed analysis of the switching dynamics of hysteresis current controlled four-leg DSTATCOM is conducted, and the design of various VSC components for compensating unbalanced and nonlinear loads is presented.  The results obtained from this analysis can be used in any applications involving hysteresis current-controlled four-leg VSC.\r\n\r\nThe VSC of DSTATCOM can compensate for the source voltage sag and swell.  However, it cannot compensate for the voltage interruption. On the other hand, the VSC of the Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) can compensate for the source voltage interruption. However, it cannot compensate for the voltage sag and swell. A combined operation of the DSTATCOM and UPS is needed to overcome these limitations. Conventionally, an energy storage system and two VSCs are required to combine the operation of DSTATCOM and UPS.\r\n\r\n A control algorithm that uses a single VSC and a battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) to function as DSTATCOM and UPS is proposed in this research work. The VSC and the battery-supercapacitor energy storage system mitigate the sag, swell, and interruption of the source voltages. Under the standard source voltages, this system mitigates the load current harmonics, unbalance, and reactive power. The proposed control algorithm uses a State of Charge (SoC) based scheme to control the battery-supercapacitor HESS. This control scheme protects the battery and supercapacitor from overcharging. Also, it eliminates the ripples in the load angle during voltage sag and swell. \r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/hhb-qzbb-bfh','','',1,'2024-06-13 04:26:40','Active'),(549,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Flexural Characteristics of Depressed-Centered Thin Grinding Wheel Specimens','Mr. Venkata Sai Prabhu Suraj Nanduru (ME21S071)','MS Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide Name: Prof. Amitava Ghosh, ME /\r\nGTC Members Names: Prof. Pijush Ghosh (AM&BE), Dr. Piyush Shakya (ME), \r\nProf. Sathyan Subbiah (Chair Person-ME)','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/06/18 15:00','2024-06-18','yes','Through Hybrid Mode: Manufacturing Engineering Section Seminar Hall (Ranganathan Building) and Googl','Depressed-center thin grinding wheels are widely employed in various industrial applications, including foundries, construction, and general fabrication sectors that require heavy stock removal. A complex state of stress develops within these wheels during grinding operations, which can sometimes lead to premature failure. This failure is largely influenced by their flexural and flexural fatigue traits. One such failure mode is delamination, which remains a persistent challenge in the abrasive industry, especially in the field of off-hand grinding wheel development. The absence of standardized testing procedures hinders the assessment of delamination characteristics in grinding wheels. However, there is a dearth of literature addressing such attributes. Hence, this study addresses the gap by comprehensively characterizing the flexural and flexural fatigue performance of commercially available depressed-center thin grinding wheels by evaluating their flexural characteristics. Flexural fracture characteristics and material properties obtained from testing appear to correlate with the typical delamination failure mode observed in real-world grinding applications. In conclusion, our experimental approach identifies critical indicators of the thin wheelâ€™s susceptibility to delamination and offers a promising methodology for assessing the delamination characteristics of the grinding wheel without extensive field trials. This study will, in turn, help evaluate new wheel material formulations and identify quality variations among several specimens produced through a specific manufacturing process route.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/umj-vpzn-fjy','','',1,'2024-06-13 05:10:27','Active'),(550,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word   -  பின்னணி, முன் வரலாறு\r\n                     -  (pinnani, mun varalaaru)\r\nHindi word   -  पृष्ठभूमि \r\n                     -  (Prushtbhoomi (ப்ருஷ்டபூமி)\r\nEnglish word  - Background\r\n','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-06-13 06:06:57','default_value'),(551,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Trace elements to identify anthropogenic and natural aerosols','Prof. Shankar Chellam','Shankar Chellam is a Professor in the Departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University.

Transboundary aeolian desert dust from the Sahara-Sahel region periodically impacts air quality in Houston, Texas.  To date, such powerful African sand and dust storms have been only qualitatively recognized to cause intense short-term spikes in aerosol concentrations in Texas resulting in haze and health advisories.  For these reasons, one of our research thrusts is to quantitate North African dust and discriminate it from locally emitted aerosols during intercontinental intrusions.  Another issue related to airborne particulate matter is that populations living adjacent to highways and busy roadways have an increased risk for morbidity and premature mortality.  This necessitates accurate identification and apportionment of ambient aerosols emitted by motor vehicles.  To date, most investigations into particulate emissions from light-duty vehicles have relied on metals such as Fe, Ca, Zn, Mn, Cu, Cd, Pb, As, Ni, Sb, Sn, Ba, Zr, Cr, and Ga for this purpose.  Since these metals are co-emitted by several other natural and anthropogenic sources, solely relying on non-platinum group elements introduces substantial uncertainties into quantitative estimates of mobile source contributions to aerosols, especially in urban and industrialized environments.  The seminar focuses on these issues by addressing the following two objectives: (i) distinguish, quantify, and apportion ambient aerosols originating from light duty, gasoline driven vehicles using platinum group elements (Pt, Pd, and Rh) and (ii) quantitate North African dust and discriminate it from locally emitted aerosols during intercontinental intrusions using rare earth elements.','Mohanakrishnan Logan','mohanlogan@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet Link: https://meet.google.com/jrv-rthg-ksc','','',1,'2024-06-13 07:34:21','Active'),(552,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL',' Design, Development, and Testing of Navigated Instruments for Image-Guided Spine Surgery','Mr. Nivash Kumar (EE21S071)','MS Scholar','Guide: Dr. Mohanasankar S','Electrical Engineering','2024/06/14 14:15','2024-06-14','yes','Online','Image-Guided Spine Surgery (IGSS) aims to improve surgical outcomes through precise navigation and real-time tracking of instruments. However, critical challenges such as plastic deformation of instruments during use and Near-InfraRed (NIR) light reflections can cause tracking inaccuracies, compromising the accuracy and effectiveness of surgical procedures. Additionally, closed implant systems and line-of-sight issues limit the surgeonâ€™s flexibility in selecting implants specific to patient needs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo overcome these challenges, the Navigated Pilot-Hole Creation Instrument (NPHCI) and a Universal Accessory (UA) have been developed. These instruments utilize Stainless Steel 17-4 PH, hardened according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) A564/A564M-19a standards, to resist plastic deformation and ensure biocompatibility. Surface finishing techniques such as sandblasting and electropolishing reduce NIR interference, providing a matte finish with enhanced corrosion resistance in the clinical environment. To increase flexibility for surgeons in implant placement, the UA features a radially symmetrical collet chuck mechanism with one revolute joint, reducing dependency on closed implant systems. This allows various manufacturers\' implant-dependent, non-navigated instruments to be converted into navigated instruments, thereby increasing options for surgeons and reducing line-of-sight issues.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe performance of the NPHCI and UA was evaluated according to ASTM F2554-22 in phantom studies, and their reliability and effectiveness were tested through cadaveric studies.

In contrast to conventional cell culture techniques which typically involve culturing millions of cells together at random, cell patterning considers the cellular heterogeneity and provides more statistical power. This technology has the potential to revolutionize biomedical research and applications by enabling researchers to study individual cells as well as intercellular interactions and interactions with their microenvironment in more detail, create complex tissue and organ models that more accurately mimic the structure and function of real tissues and organs, and develop new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. A crucial step in cell patterning is to regulate cell adhesion on a substrate by adapting several physical and biochemical strategies for substrate modification and patterning.\r\n\r\nIn this work we describe a simple method for creating microengineered patterned co-cultures suitable for high-throughput applications. Our method allows spatial control over the localization of two cell types, by sequential seeding of two cell populations onto predefined protein patterned substrates. The versatility of our co-culture method is demonstrated by generating co-cultures of various cell combinations on different shapes and sizes. The predefined protein patterns for the co-culture is achieved using a modified microcontact printing technique which integrates microfluidics with the microcontact printing. Wherein, one protein is stamped onto the desired substrate, while the second protein is flowed through the embedded grooves. Microengineered patterned co-cultures with varying compositions and architecture can be used to study interactions between different cell types and the effect of cell organization on tissue function in vitro. These patterned co-cultures might be very helpful for screening applications and offer more realistic in vitro models for comprehending cell and tissue function.\r\n\r\nAnother approach we are looking into is wettability patterns for cell patterning. Open surface microfluidics, in contrast to conventional closed channel microfluidics, facilitates the manipulation and transportation of liquids in microvolumes on open surfaces. The most prevalent method for accomplishing this is to modify surface wettability. Here in this work we create substrates that consist of juxtaposed regions of superhydrophilic (wettable) and superhydrophobic (non-wettable) domains in a is direct, one-step, mask-free approach. The discontinuous dewetting phenomenon provides the foundation for the creation of cell culture microdroplet arrays. This micropatterning-derived 2D droplet microarray technology offers a perfect high-throughput, miniaturized platform for 2D and 3D cell culture in a non-destructive manner. This approach for cell patterning is simple, robust and more economic and cost effective.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/ewg-ucvd-mmh','','',1,'2024-06-13 10:17:43','Active'),(554,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Thermal Performance Investigation of Enhanced Flat Thermosyphon Heat Sinks',' Mr. Dhanalakota Praveen (ME18D705)','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide: Prof. Arvind Pattamatta, ME /\r\nCo-Guide: Dr. Pallab Sinha Mahapatra, ME','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/06/14 15:00','2024-06-14','yes',' Through Google Meet:  https://meet.google.com/qct-zcwk-ivg','','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/qct-zcwk-ivg','','',1,'2024-06-14 01:13:31','Active'),(555,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Input side line current waveshaping for Solid State Transformer and Medium Voltage Drives at light load condition.','Mr. Himanshu Patel (EE18D420) ','Ph.D scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Kamalesh  Hatua','Electrical Engineering','2024/06/18 14:00','2024-06-18','yes','Online (Googlemeet)','This work focuses on three-stage (MV/HF DC-DC/LV) CHB-based Solid State Transformer (SST) technology-based architecture for both grid integration and motor drive applications. The research focuses on developing advanced control strategies to enhance the performance of SST applications. They are mainly wind and solar farms, data centers, microgrids, EV charging stations, and propulsion drives. SST technology is becoming the most attractive solution for direct integration of MVAC grid with LVAC/LVDC grid. It offers high power density with advanced grid support, which is not possible with conventional Low-Frequency Transformer (LFT) based solution. This work addresses the associated challenges, including control complexity, power quality issues, and higher semiconductor losses in MV stage of CHB-based SST for aforementioned applications.\r\n\r\nThe MV grid-connected SST introduces power quality issues (poor current THD) due to the dead time effect and harmonics present in grid voltage. The power quality issues, especially at light load conditions are more significant. A novel hybrid control technique is proposed to ensure perfectly sinusoidal MV grid current even under light load conditions, resulting in improved grid current THD. Experimental validation using a 1.2kV(MV)/400V(DC)/200V(AC), 20kW CHB-based SST prototype demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach. The proposed hybrid control technique is further extended to address the trade-off between cost and performance of the SST that explores a cost-effective alternative utilizing both Si-IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs in the MV stage. The extended  hybrid control approach simultaneously improves semiconductor losses (nearly 50 %) as well as power quality with higher effective switching frequency.\r\n\r\nSST technology holds immense potential for next-generation MV motor drive applications, particularly in marine propulsion systems, because the lighter and compact electric drive is the preferred choice in this application. This work also proposes a modified CHB-based SST-fed high-frequency propulsion drive with a new modulation technique. The proposed drive offers high power density and achieves a higher effective switching frequency with reduced semiconductor losses. It is validated in a 7-level modified CHB-based SST-fed field-oriented controlled induction motor drive prototype. To further enhance the reliability of variable speed drives, this research also addresses their sensitivity to power supply disturbances. A simple and cost-effective regenerative ride-through technique is proposed for CHB inverter-based vector-controlled induction motor drives, ensuring smooth operation during power interruptions or voltage sag. This improves overall system resilience.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/iyh-wpqm-nju','','',1,'2024-06-14 04:19:49','Active'),(556,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Analysis of Morphological Differences of Nuclei and Cytoplasm in Lung Cancer Fluorescence and Brightfield Images for Drug Target Classification','Ms. Sreelekshmi P S (AM21D042)','Ph.

To address this growing challenge, this work focuses on the development of a postural correction system that is time-efficient and cost-effective. Existing solutions often rely on vibration or visual feedback, which can lead to various drawbacks. In this work, the use of haptic feedback during the upper limb reaching task is explored as an alternative to traditional feedback modalities. When an incorrect posture is detected, the system provides indirect feedback by increasing the force required to move the end-effector. The evaluation of this haptic feedback-based postural correction system reveals a significant reduction in postural error (p < 0.0001) without compromising reaching task performance.. Furthermore, to optimize the postural adaptation process, a performance-based adaptive algorithm for task difficulty variation is developed. The developed algorithm is validated for haptic feedback based postural adaptation system, and results indicate a strong correlation between usersâ€™ postural error and predetermined task difficulty (Pearson correlation, r = +0.9768, p < 0.0001). Therefore, the algorithm adjusts the task difficulty based on the userâ€™s performance and attempts to optimize the process of motor adaptation. Moreover, the use of haptic devices in postural correction systems is hindered by their cost and cumbersome nature, limiting their widespread adoption. In this work, a pseudo-haptic feedback based postural correction method has been developed. Results indicate a significant reduction in postural error as a result of pseudo-haptic feedback (p < 0.001). This approach eliminates the need for expensive hardware to provide haptic feedback, ensuring the affordability and accessibility of postural correction systems.\r\n','HoD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/wxt-eszd-xbq','','',1,'2024-06-14 05:07:17','Active'),(558,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Investigations on the Molecular Mechanism of Nanoscale Interfacial Heat Transport','Mr. Abhijith A (AM16D016)','Ph.

Despite its importance, comprehensive theories or mathematical models adequately addressing TBR in such contexts remain scarce.\r\n\r\nThis presentation explores the role of interfacial molecular mobility in TBR, using two different liquidsâ€”water and perfluorohexaneâ€”interfaced with graphene. By equilibrating these nanoconfined liquids at various temperatures, distinct levels of molecular mobility were achieved, revealing critical insights into heat transfer mechanisms. Notably, perfluorohexane, with minimal changes in molecular mobility, exhibited a linear thermal boundary conductance (TBC) response to temperature. In contrast, water demonstrated a quadratic relationship between temperature and TBC due to significant increases in molecular mobility. Further analysis, including the self-diffusion coefficient and spectral heat current calculations, substantiates the proposed hypothesis on the influence of molecular mobility on TBR.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a novel data-driven approach to modeling TBR is introduced. This methodology leverages Machine Learning (ML) techniques and extensive Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to map TBR to macroscopic observable properties. The robustness of these models is ensured by data collection from multiple simulations with varying initial conditions. Ensemble and non-linear models provide superior predictions, revealing complex, higher-order relationships between TBR and system properties.\r\n\r\nThis research advances the understanding of TBR and offers innovative predictive capabilities, contributing significantly to fields such as high-power electronic cooling, targeted drug delivery, nanoparticle-assisted cancer therapeutics, energy conversion, and energy storage using phase change materials.\r\n','HoD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','Keywords: Thermal boundary resistance; Interfacial thermal resistance; Kapitza resistance; Nanoscale','','',1,'2024-06-14 06:05:00','Active'),(559,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Stress-diffusion interactions in viscoelastic electrodes',' Ms. Sanjana Talukdar, Roll No. ME17D407','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide: Prof. Narasimhan Swaminathan, ME, IITM /\r\nCo-Guide: Prof. Parag Ravindran, ME, IITM','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/06/21 11:00','2024-06-21','yes','Through Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/kcg-qbbk-fnn','','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/kcg-qbbk-fnn','','',1,'2024-06-14 06:32:29','Active'),(560,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Analysis of EEG signal for steady state visual evoked potential based brain computer interface','Mr. T Janardhan Reddy (AM18D017)','Ph.

This BCI provides an alternative non-neuromuscular route towards communicating with the environment. Among the various electroencephalogram (EEG) components that can be modulated by the userâ€™s intent, BCIs based on the steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) are studied due to their high information transfer rate (ITR) and minimal training time. The performance of SSVEP based BCI depends mainly on the number of targets present in the user interface and the target detection accuracy. The focus of the study is to develop signal processing approaches for the enhancement of accuracy with minimal computations.

These techniques require the User Equipment (UE) to select the best precoder for downlink transmission from a set of codebook entries and send the corresponding Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI) as feedback to the Base Station (BS). Various methods have been proposed in the literature to choose the best possible PMI. The Exhaustive Search (ES) method that examines all possible entries of the codebook is the conventional method.  However, the computational complexity of searching all codebook entries is significantly high. Also, with the increase in MIMO technologies, the codebook size grows, resulting in even longer search times.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work presents a low-complexity PMI selection method that leverages the spatial characteristics of the codebook entries. In this method, the UE approximates the transmit beam to estimate the coarse Angle of Departure (AOD), which is then mapped to PMI using a novel PMI-to-angle mapping look-up table (LUT). This coarse estimate is then used to reduce the codebook size, and the final PMI is obtained by searching the reduced codebook.

Through the development of robust conceptual frameworks, the research addresses three critical facets: affective and behavioral responses to brand transgressions, the role of shame during brand transgressions, and the stage-wise development of branded individuals in consumer-brand relationships.\r\nStudy 1: This study delves into the differentiation between types of brand transgressions. The multidisciplinary theoretical integration in the study adopts exchange and penetration principles of social psychology and trust in interpersonal relationships to explain the development and decline of consumer-brand relationships. The findings of the study elucidate the nature of trust consumers develop with brands and highlight the distinct consequences of brand transgressions. Brand transgressions are categorized into two types â€“ dissatisfaction and violation of trust. The study posits that dissatisfaction arises from performance-related failures, while trust violation results from values-related failures by the brand. It also presents the unique affective and behavioral consumer responses to these different transgression scenarios. \r\nStudy 2: Transgressions by brands that fail to meet consumer moral/ethical expectations are perceived by consumers as failures in their own self-evaluation and otherâ€™s judgment of their personal standards. Study 2 highlights the importance of exploring negative self-conscious emotions that result from self-evaluation in consumer-brand relationships. Building on the understanding from Study 1, this study specifically investigates the affective and behavioral consumer responses to negative self-conscious emotion of shame arising from a brandâ€™s moral/ethical violation of trust. Addressing the limited attention given to exploring negative self-conscious emotions in consumer-brand relationships, this study examines the antecedents and consequences of shame. Further, the study identifies self-evaluation and anticipation of social responses as mediators and brand attachment as moderating consumer experience of shame. \r\nStudy 3: Insights from Study 2 highlight the profound impact of moral/ethical violations of trust, emphasizing the importance of extending this understanding to the heightened emotional bonds formed in consumer relationships with branded individuals. This study presents a stage-wise developmental model of branded individuals, identifying three stages â€“ human brands, celebrity, and person-brands. Human brands establish trust through consistent performance and professional reliability, while celebrities deepen consumer connections by sharing personal insights, and person-brands merge personal and professional identities. The study explores the distinction between trust dynamics and equity at each of these stages. \r\nOverall, this research enhances the theoretical and practical understanding of consumer-brand relationships, particularly in the face of brand transgressions. The findings offer significant implications for theory and practice aiming to navigate and mitigate the complexities of maintaining consumer trust in today\'s competitive marketplace.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','SEMINAR - II (RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM)-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-15 07:18:32','Active'),(567,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Estimation State of Charge (SoC) of Li-ion Batteries with Deep Learning Techniques','Mr. Pratik Mondal, ME21S042','MS Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide Name: Dr. Mayank Mittal, ME /\r\nGTC Members Names:    Dr. J.

These methods are free from any modelling restrictions because they donâ€™t rely on battery models. \r\nThis work aims to present a comprehensive comparison study of SoC estimation using artificial neural network (ANN) and different recurrent neural networks (RNNs), namely, long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models applied to lithium-ion batteries and additionally inspect the effect of different model parameters on the performance. These deep learning models are trained on drive cycle data obtained from cell-level batteries to estimate SoC. In addition, temperature and noise effects are considered to evaluate the robustness of the models. The effectiveness is evaluated with RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R2 score. Furthurmore, the trained model is evaluated using real-time data obtained from a two-wheeler electric vehicle.\r\nThe comparison provides insights into the suitability and effectiveness of ANN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU for SoC estimation in lithium-ion battery systems, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each architecture. In addition, this study definitively gives significant insight into cell-level and pack-level SoC estimation, mentioning the potential of deep learning models in advancing battery management systems and paving the way for more intelligent and autonomous energy storage solutions.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-16 03:47:55','Active'),(568,'','Workshop',NULL,'A one-day workshop on \\\"Catalysis: A Key to a Sustainable Future\\\" on Friday, June 21, 2024, at the IC & SR auditorium, Hall-III, ',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Dear All: We are happy to inform you that a one-day workshop on \\\"Catalysis: A Key to a Sustainable Future\\\" is organized on Friday, June 21, 2024, at the IC & SR Auditorium, Hall-III, IIT Madras.

The west and east coasts of the Indian peninsula have this topographical setting and often receive extreme rainfall during the southwest and northeast monsoons, respectively. In this talk, I will show that offshore and onshore propagation of precipitating systems is controlled by a non-dimensional Froude number (F) of the onshore flow, which is a ratio of the kinetic energy of flow and stratification. Low F (&lt; 0.5) implies orographic blocking and promotes offshore propagation. On the other hand, High F (&gt; 1) promotes onshore propagation. The low F regime also supports land-sea/mountain-valley breezes and, hence, a stronger diurnal cycle of rainfall. Conversely, the High F regime suppresses the thermal topographic effects and the diurnal cycle of rainfall. In this regime, rainfall over land occurs mainly due to the mechanical uplifting of onshore winds. A critical onshore flow (F âˆ¼ 1) may exhibit quasi-stationary rainfall over the coast. Some of the recent extreme rainfall events over the Tamil Nadu coast during the northeast monsoon indeed fall in the critical category. During the landfall of cyclonic vortices, the upwind vorticity production via orographic blocking (and the resulting vortex stretching) dominates the vorticity budget of the weaker vortices, thus stalling their propagation. This hypothesis also implies that moderate depressions are likely to cause more severe flooding than stronger tropical cyclones due to their quasi-stationary behavior along the coast.','Anubhab Roy','anubhab@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/hdq-mdgb-zsm','','',1,'2024-06-17 12:24:12','Active'),(574,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Novel Approaches to Charge and Compound a Single-Cylinder Diesel Engine.','Mr. J.

Since the exhaust gas flow is intermittent, single-cylinder engines available in the market are seldom turbocharged despite turbocharging being a staple technology in multi-cylinder engines. Hence, almost one-third of the fuel energy is lost in the exhaust, reducing the performance of single-cylinder engines. The current work investigates novel approaches to charge and compound a commercial single-cylinder diesel engine to extract power from the pulsated exhaust gas flow. In the first approach, an exhaust plenum was employed in the intake manifold to mitigate the exhaust gas flow pulsations to turbocharge the single-cylinder engine. In the second approach, a supercharger was used to charge the engine and an impulse turbine was compounded to extract energy from the pulsated exhaust gas flow. Finally, the third approach investigates the benefits of impulse turbine compounding of the naturally aspirated single-cylinder engine. Thus, the current work explores novel approaches to address the shortcomings of conventional pulse turbocharging to suggest a practically viable approach to charge and compound single-cylinder diesel engines. A combined experimental and numerical approach is carried out to compare the proposed novel approaches and arrive at the most suitable approach to charge single-cylinder diesel engines for performance improvement and pollutant reduction.

High power density solutions for connecting MVAC to LVDC systems are critical, particularly for supplying EV charging stations, data centers integrated with renewable energy sources, and other rising DC loads/sources. SST also brings numerous other benefits on the power supply side, including bidirectional power flow control, VAR compensation, harmonic compensation, grid-side disturbance isolation, fault-tolerant operation, and many other features. The Input Series Output Parallel (ISOP) architecture with a Cascaded H-Bridge arrangement on the Medium Voltage (MV) side is one of the most widespread SST architecture. However, as the system\'s power rating increases, so does its hardware and control complexity, making it more difficult to implement practically such a cutting-edge solution due to higher control complexity, cost, and loss number.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, this work proposes a simple yet effective closed-loop control architecture for the SST system to control its LVDC, eliminating closed loop requirement from the entire isolated DC-DC stage making the practical realization of the SST system simple and convenient. The proposed SST has two essential stages: Medium-Voltage (MV), and DC-DC stage. The SST system uses a CHB configuration to realize the MV stage. Each CHB cell is connected to the corresponding Series Resonant Converter (SRC) cell in DC-DC stage. SRC converters are operated at resonance and open loop conditions. This condition offers natural voltage balancing (among the DC links of CHB units) without any closed-loop control in DC-DC stage. This intrinsic advantage decreases control complexity in the MV stage as well. The proposed control architecture is modular so it can be extended for any power and voltage level. The feasibility of the proposed control architecture is validated experimentally in a 1.65 kV (MVAC)/600 V (LVDC), 8 kW prototype SST system.\r\n\r\nAlthough the resonance function ensures soft switching in DC-DC stage under all loading conditions, the MV stage still faces hard switching, reducing overall system efficiency. When SiC MOSFET devices are used in the MV stage over Si IGBT devices (to reduce semiconductor loss), the semiconductor cost of the system increases drastically.  As a result, Si IGBT and SiC MOSFET are introduced appropriately in the MV stage and are switched based on their merits using a novel line frequency modulation technique that reduces semiconductor losses without increasing semiconductor cost while ensuring a high effective switching frequency (high power density and fast system response is also ensured). The line frequency modulation results in unbalanced voltage and power-sharing among CHB cells (in AC side of it), resulting in asymmetrical component ratings. The limitation of unsymmetrical voltage, power, and component ratings is overcome using a circulation logic. The line modulation method for SST system was initially implemented for a three-stage SST system (application limited to Grid-to-grid) which has an additional LV stage. Later, it is extended for a two-stage SST system (without LV stage) making it suitable for Grid-to-grid as well as Grid-to-LVDC interface, which further improves the practical feasibility of the SST system. Later, the line frequency modulation method has been further extended to reduce further hardware complexity (eliminates a single SRC unit). The proposed control methodology is proven experimentally in a 600 V (MVAC)/200 V (LVDC), 5 kW prototype SST system.\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/zio-qegj-nku','','',1,'2024-06-18 04:07:14','Active'),(576,'','Special Talk',NULL,'Medical Imaging for Cancer Prognostication using AI',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Speaker: Prof. (Dr.) Amit Mehndiratta, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi\r\n\r\nAbout: Prof. Amit Mehndiratta received his D.Phil. in Engineering Science from the University of Oxford, UK.

Clinical radiology using MR imaging is a noninvasive modality for cancer management, commonly used in treatment planning and response assessment. Artificial intelligence (AI), with its advanced machine learning algorithms and high computation power, has found a critical place in cancer management by automatizing various workflow processes in clinical practice. The role of AI in medical imaging, for image reconstruction, quantitative analysis, and assistance in prognosis prediction is still in its nascent stages. Much research has been published in the last ten years, expanding the horizons of AI in medical imaging, but the actual applications of AI in clinical radiology remain challenging.  This talk will showcase some examples of AI algorithms used in cancer assessment for early diagnosis, treatment response analysis, and prediction. The talk will cover medical image analysis applications in various cancers, such as Bone Cancer (Osteosarcoma), Prostate cancer, and Liver Cancer (Hepatocellular carcinoma). The talk will also discuss the key challenges for use of AI in medical imaging, such as regulatory challenges, ethical issues, accountability, and issues related to the acceptance of this powerful technology by the clinical community and patients.  \r\n','Swaminathan','edoffice@iitm.ac.in','','announce18-06-2024 04:29','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/announce18-06-2024 04:29',1,'2024-06-18 04:29:58','default_value'),(577,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- மேற்படி (merpadi)\r\nHindi word	- यथोपरि, जैसे ऊपर ( yathopari, jaise oopar (யதோபரி, ஜைஸே  ஊபர் )\r\nEnglish word   - Ditto\r\n','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-06-18 04:45:26','default_value'),(578,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Predictive Modeling for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Progression and Brain Age Estimation','Mr. AQIL K H (EE20S049) ','MS Scholar','Guide: Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam','Electrical Engineering','2024/06/21 15:30','2024-06-21','yes','Online','Time series forecasting is a crucial area of research in healthcare, enabling the prediction of patient outcomes based on clinical factors and monitoring progression in chronic diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s, where long-term management is critical.

Firstly, we propose a novel approach to predict the progression of Alzheimerâ€™s disease by leveraging a multimodal time-series forecasting system based on graph representation learning.\r\n \r\nThe second approach focuses on estimating brain age, which is emerging as a valuable tool for predicting various brain conditions and disorders. Estimating brain age provides insights into the consequences of aging on the brain and facilitates the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, Parkinsonâ€™s, and dementia. We focus on algorithms leveraging deformation fields with debiasing in T1- Weighted MRI images to learn representation vectors that capture the biological variability (age). To achieve this, we explore the use of learnable deformation fields combined with a contrast invariant training method (SynthMorph).\r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/zvu-afym-siu','','',1,'2024-06-18 04:47:13','Active'),(579,'','Workshop',NULL,'Kind invitation for a one-day workshop on “Catalysis - A Key to a Sustainable Future” , June 21, 2024, IC & SR Auditorium, Hall-III',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Dear Colleagues,\r\n\r\nWe would be delighted if you could kindly accept our invitation to participate in the one-day workshop on\r\n\\\"Catalysis: A Key to a Sustainable Future\\\" on Friday, June 21\r\n, 2024, at the IC & SR auditorium, Hall-III, IIT Madras.\r\nPlease find attached a flyer with a detailed program for your information and reference.\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSanjay\r\nHead of the Department, Chemistry\r\n','O/o Head of the department','cyoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','ALL ARE WELCOME',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-06-18 05:07:45','default_value'),(580,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Zero-dimensional modeling of various in-cylinder phenomena of spark ignition engine','Mr. Chandra Kumar Chandrakar (ME20S025)','MS Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide name â€“ Dr. Varunkumar S (ME) /\r\nCo-Guide name â€“ Prof. Mayank Mittal (ME)\r\nGTC members names â€“ 1) Prof. Babu Viswanathan (Chair Person) (ME) 2) Prof. Ramesh A (ME) 3) Prof. Himanshu Goyal (CH)\r\n','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/06/20 16:00','2024-06-20','yes','Room number 207, Rudolf Diesel Hall, Internal Combustion Engine Lab, IIT Madras','The utilization of the zero-dimensional (0-D) modeling approach has emerged as a valuable technique for simulating various complex phenomena due to its fast computation time. This thesis presents the utilization of 0-D modeling to ease the understanding and simulations of different in-cylinder phenomena occurring in spark ignition (SI) engines. These phenomena include in-cylinder fluid motion, turbulence generation, combustion, and emissions formations, which collectively influence the performance of SI engines. This thesis is broadly divided into two parts. The first part details the evolution of in-cylinder fluid motion during intake and compression strokes, which significantly influence fuel-air mixing and combustion processes. Extensive research has focused on flow evolution in medium- to large-sized engines, while small-bore engines are crucial for the automotive market, especially for two- and three-wheeled vehicles. In this study, a 0-D model developed using validated CFD simulations is used to analyze the flow fields of an SI engine with displacement volume of 110 cmÂ³. The model is then used to evaluate the quantified strength of the flow by calculating the tumble ratio and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). The study is further extended to analyze the effect of engine speed on the evolution of flow fields. With an increase in engine speed, relatively higher values of tumble ratio and TKE at the end of the compression stroke are observed, which is expected to improve combustion efficiency and reduce exhaust emissions. Therefore, in the second part of the thesis, a comprehensive approach to combustion and emission modeling is presented, where all the sub-models that provide input to the combustion and emission models are developed and validated individually against the results obtained from CFD simulations. Finally, a full engine cycle simulation is performed by integrating these sub-models. Results obtained from the 0-D model showed good agreement with results obtained from CFD simulations with changes in operating conditions.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-18 06:06:23','Active'),(581,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Phase behaviour and molecular interactions in aqueous sodium polystyrene sulphonate (NaPSS) systems','Rinsha Padmarajan','PhD student, Roll No. MM18D016,  Department of MME, IITM.','Guide: Dr. Sreeram K.

This research explores the patterns of ergativity in Assamese, an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the eastern state of Assam, and clarifies why split-ergativity is indigenous to this language whereas optional ergativity is a borrowed phenomenon. Further, it focuses on the differences in ergative patterns between the Standard Assamese (SA) and its varieties, where the former shows both the features, but the latter shows only the split ergativity. Subsequently, to explain optionality as a borrowed phenomenon, we consider other neighbouring languages such as Hindi (Indo-Aryan) and Bodo (Tibeto-Burman) which manifest optionality in their case marking system. Hindi has an optional ergative system whereas Bodo shows optionality in its nominative system. This helps us to contend that split exclusivity in the varieties of Assamese, and the availability of optional reading in the Standard Assamese is a consequence of a prolonged language assimilation. This claim is further substantiated by diachronic evidence where a comprehensive investigation of 14th to 19th century literary texts in Assamese provides various instances of split ergativity existing for centuries, but there is no attestation of optional ergativity in these texts.

One of the significant challenges for deep submersible designers is to reduce the weight of the pressure hull while increasing the payload, and propulsion velocity of submersible vessels, lowering the cost of submersible construction, and providing life support for the hull with the lowest weight-to-buoyancy ratio at a given depth. An appropriate high strength low density structural configuration is required which should be compatible with ease of fabrication and toughness. These properties help in designing appropriately, considering operable depth for the application, while also reducing the weight and cost of the pressure hull.\r\n           This study investigates unstiffened and stiffened cylinder based on conventional submarine design formulae (SDF), incorporating different material properties and focusing on the inclusion with key parameters such as operating depth, thickness, diameter, length between bulkheads, interframe distance, and number of ring stiffeners, etc., into the model. It is important to know the collapse behaviour of submarine hull, which can be classified as pre-buckling and post-buckling analysis. To understand the pre-buckling behavior of submarine hulls, a linear buckling mode analysis is conducted on the unstiffened shell segment located between stiffeners and the results are compared with analytical solutions. For the post-buckling analysis, non-linear methods are employed, using the \'Arc-Length Method\' to thoroughly examine the stable and unstable responses of the pressure hull. In this context, four sub-models with varying bulkhead lengths are developed and analyzed, and their results are compared against both analytical solutions and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) based solutions.\r\n            Analytical studies are carried out using (MATLABTM) and simulation model is implemented with commercially available software (ABAQUS*TM). We presented the results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the â€˜Arc-Length Methodâ€™ in identifying variations in yield pressure as bulkhead length changes. We believe that this study contributes to a deeper understanding of pre-buckling and post-buckling analysis of submarine hull, particularly in accommodating different bulkhead lengths.\r\n','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-19 04:50:22','Active'),(587,'seminar','Technical Talk','NULL','Medical Imaging for Cancer Prognostication using AI','Prof. (Dr.) Amit Mehndiratta, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi','Prof. Amit Mehndiratta received his D.Phil. in Engineering Science from the University of Oxford, UK.

The porosity of this complex system play a critical role in several engineering applications, such as CO2 sequestration, wellbore strengthening, enhanced oil and hydrocarbon recovery, hydraulic fracturing, nuclear waste disposal, and other subsurface activities. Any subsurface processes which involves solid-fluid interactions results in the changes in porosity which in turn affects the medium\'s permeability and stiffness. Typically, when fluid is injected into the porous medium, permeation occurs associated with small or negligible deformation of the soil skeleton. This phenomenon is followed by cavity expansion/ fingering/ fracturing (different forms of instabilities) due to the large deformation, especially when the flow rate is greater than the ability of the medium to permeate the fluid. Understanding this coupled multiphysics process is critical in designing intricate subsurface geostructures.	\r\nThe present study focuses on understanding the underlying mechanisms governing the permeation-induced cavity evolution within the porous medium. A suite of controlled laboratory experimental studies were carried out at constant injection pressure to identify distinct filtration zones due to the transient flow. These zones include the internal filter cake, primary and secondary filtration zones, and subsequent fluid loss. The formation of internal filter cake in the porous medium effectively regulates fluid flow during the injection process. To effectively model this flow, a novel time dependent parameter, permeation coefficient (Î¶) is introduced. This parameter partitions the flow rate required for permeation and elastoplastic deformation. Finally, a coupled semi-analytical cavity expansion model is proposed by considering appropriate constitutive models to quantify the evolution of the pore pressure, displacement, and stress fields during the fluid injection process in addition to capturing the cavity boundary, permeation front and plastic radius.\r\n\r\n','R.

In all the two parameter models taken into consideration, we find that both BPS and non-BPS extremal black hole attractors are always unique for a given, supporting electric charge configuration; moreover, non-BPS black holes are always unstable, and thus they decay into constituent BPS/anti-BPS pairs: this confirms the WGC, for which macroscopic non-supersymmetric solutions are bound to decay.

While an elastic, network-forming component allows stretched polymer chains to return to their relaxed, entropically stable state, and a switching component affords at least one thermal transition to regulate fixation of a desired metastable strain state and reversion to a previous strain state.

We implement and evaluate the proposed\r\nsolutions in live-air using COTS smartphones.\r\n\r\nWhen RT video calling and gaming apps race with non-real-time (NRT)\r\ntraffic, severe degradation in the Quality of Experience (QoE) of RT\r\napps.  Hence, an Application Prioritization Engine (APE) framework was\r\nproposed and implemented to improve user experience by dynamically\r\nmanaging bandwidth to the different apps. APE helps improve the end-user\r\nexperience by detecting and prioritizing RT traffic over concurrent\r\nbest-effort traffic. APE uses the eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter)\r\nto control NRT traffic without additional packet processing overhead.\r\n\r\nBuilding on APE, an AI-driven framework, Game Stabilizer (GS), was\r\ndeveloped to enhance the online mobile gaming experience. Utilizing\r\nmachine learning to manage non-real-time (NRT) traffic, the GS\r\nsignificantly reduces latency by up to 60%, ensuring smooth and\r\nresponsive gaming experiences under diverse network\r\nconditions. Furthermore, many applications lack proper QoS\r\nconfigurations, leading to suboptimal user experiences. To address this\r\nissue, we propose QBOX (Quality Box), an app-agnostic approach that\r\nleverages Wi-Fi Access Category to enhance QoS in smartphone\r\napplications. QBOX dynamically detects the RT traffic and upgrades its\r\nWi-Fi priority access category from Best-effort (BE) to Voice (VO) or\r\nVideo (VI), ensuring efficient and reliable data delivery. It improves\r\napplication latency by up to 24%, resulting in smoother and more\r\nresponsive experiences.\r\n\r\nPoor Wi-Fi conditions and network handovers can lead to sub-par gaming\r\nand calling experience. Hence, a framework called ODIN (On-Device\r\nIntelligence) was developed. This leverages the QUIC protocol alongside\r\nAI to facilitate seamless handovers between cellular and Wi-Fi\r\nnetworks. This AI-driven approach enables predictive analytics to\r\ndetermine the most opportune moments for network transitions,\r\nsignificantly minimizing disruptions and latency in RT\r\napplications. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, network traffic classification is essential to managing and\r\noptimizing modern network environments. An eBPF-assisted AI method was\r\ndeveloped to provide efficient and accurate smartphone traffic\r\nclassification. This is based on a power-efficient approach that\r\nselectively processes specific app traffic, optimizing resource\r\nutilization and enhancing classification efficiency. Integrating eBPF\r\nand BPF maps enabled real-time, low-latency traffic classification with\r\nimproved accuracy and scalability.\r\n','Prof. Krishna Sivalingam','skrishnam@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/swh-trof-gvy','','',1,'2024-06-20 04:20:19','Active'),(598,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Numerical Study of Burn Rate Augmentation due to Radiation in Solid Rocket Motors using coupled model','Mr.Krishna Prasad.

Further, these compounds are emerging as a promising class of semiconducting intermetallics. Their exceptional power factor, coupled with the advantages of abundant and inexpensive constituent elements, make them highly attractive candidates for spin-transfer-torque devices and efficient thermoelectric energy conversion applications [1]. In the present work, we have investigated the effect of disorder on low temperature magnetic and electrical transport properties of Fe2TMAl (TM: V, Cr) alloys. Additionally, the incorporation of rare-earth element dopants has been explored with the objective of optimizing their physical properties for targeted applications. Our findings suggest that the phase transformation from the non-magnetic, ï³-FeV to a ferromagnetic bcc phase upon aluminum (Al) doping. Furthermore, the additional substitution of Al for V appears to enhance electrical conductivity while concurrently lowering the Curie temperature (TC). The defects in FeV (with ï³-phase) and Fe2VAl (L21-phase) result in the development of ferromagnetic clusters [2]. These FM cluster can result in strong spin fluctuations and affect the electrical properties. The electrical properties of rare-earth element doped Fe2VAl alloys is understood on the basis of simple parabolic band model. From the temperature variation of thermal conductivity along with the estimated Lorenz number, we analyzed the lattice thermal conductivity to obtain information about the phonon scattering mechanisms in the studied materials [3]. The observed significant reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity in the RE-doped Fe2VAl is attributed to the decrease in the average grain size that leads to more grain boundary scattering. Finally, we have demonstrated that the heavy rare-earth element doping is an effective strategy in enhancing the figure of merit of the Fe2VAl alloy [3, 4].\r\n1.	T. Gasi et al., Phys. Rev.

Metamaterial-based absorbers, with their compact design and user-defined frequency characteristics, offer advantages over traditional absorbers, which are bulky and often limited in frequency response. However, reliance on commercial substrates like FR-4 restricts metamaterial absorber design due to their fixed dielectric and mechanical properties. Developing custom substrates for metamaterial absorbers provides a holistic way to design these electromagnetic structures by providing choice over dielectric constant, thickness, and flexibility. This research focuses on developing single-layered, resonance-based microwave metamaterial absorbers suitable for miniaturized and conformal systems using custom-engineered substrates. The first part of the research addressed a solution to the problem of reducing the dimensions of the metamaterial absorber by developing a high-permittivity ceramic substrate. The second part of the thesis focuses on developing flexible metamaterial absorbers using epoxy and graphene nanoplatelet (E-GnP) composite as substrates. Systematically varying the GnP content in the epoxy allowed for tailoring both the composite\'s dielectric and mechanical properties. The subsequent work demonstrates the realization of flexible metamaterial absorbers with enhanced bandwidth by combining optimized design with engineered materials with tailored losses. The resonance-based absorbers developed in this work offer a simpler design, reduced thickness, and easier integration with compact systems. This flexibility in material and design choices opens up possibilities for highly customized metamaterial absorbers for diverse practical applications.\r\nReferences:\r\n1. M.

Its competition with other ordered phases of matter like magnetism and superconductivity, and its formation in systems with strong electronic correlations or spin orbit coupling leads to rich physics that can allow us to develop tunable electronic properties. Understanding the origin of the CDW often hinges upon developing effective models to understand experimental signatures of the charge ordering. \r\nIn this talk, we will discuss on the origin and behavior of CDW in monolayer NbSe2 that has generated recent interest due to the interplay between experimentally observed CDW state, presence of an Ising spin orbit coupling, and observation of non trivial disorder physics. Starting with a realistic Hamiltonian derived from the first principle calculation, we discuss how the CDW in 2H-NbSe2 originates from strong momentum dependent electron phonon coupling. We next explore the effect of isolated impurities and edge disorder on the CDW state and address recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experimental results. We further show that the first principal calculations of strong Ferromagnetic fluctuations in this material can lead to the formation of an induced magnetic moment and predict its local AFM structure that can be probed in future experiments. \r\n\r\nWe will also briefly discuss CDW instability in a bilayer Ruthenate material Sr3Ru2O7 , and show that observation of CDW like features in local probe spectroscopy experiments can be explained by the presence of an orbital selective band renormalization. \r\n\r\n1) Buddhadeb Debnath, Mayank Gupta, B.

Kanto Fire Whirl (1923) still carries the curse of being one the most devastating peacetime fires in human history. A wind and an obstruction upstream to the fire source are the two main contributors to the transition of an ordinary fire to a fire whirl. This work focuses on the formation of fire whirl over pools of liquid fuels placed behind an L-shaped wall. The numerical model is validated by means of comparison between the numerical and experimental results of temporal and averaged flame heights for the methanol fire whirl under the cross-flow velocities, U = 0.3 â€“ 1.0 m/s. During these studies, the fire whirls are found to exist only for a range of cross-flow velocities, beyond which these cease to exist. To explore this further, three more fuels, namely ethanol, n-heptane, and dodecane too, are tested. The total number of cases studied counts to twenty arising out of five cross-flow velocities and four fuels. These non-identical combinations of cross-flow velocities for which the fire whirl exists and the heat release rates corresponding to different fuels are used to modify Heskestadâ€™s correlation for flame height. The swirl number is introduced for this, quantifying the relative dominance of angular and axial momentum. Tilting of flame in the downstream and the cross-stream directions are explained using temperature, species and velocity fields. The tangential and radial velocities are found to be the highest near the pool surface, and they decrease along the height. The asymptotic and the non-linear decrease in their magnitude is also explained using the varying flame curvatures. The flame stretches and tilts towards the downstream direction are found to be more significant than the cross-stream direction. This is due to the shielding of the flame by the crossflow air. The results presented can significantly aid in understanding several factors influencing the formation and dynamics of fire whirls and can be used to design fire whirl induced combustors or incinerators for the in-situ burning of wastes.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/set-qiwn-txe','','',1,'2024-06-20 07:05:29','Active'),(607,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','HEAT TRANSMISSION CHARACTERISTICS OF LIGHT SHELVES','Ms. Archana A P, Roll No.CE20D003','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. Benny Raphael - Guide, Dr. Ramamurthy K - DC Member, Dr. Ganesan A R (PH) - DC Member, Dr. Sateesh Gedupudi (ME) - DC Member, Dr. R G Robinson - Chairperson\r\n','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/07/01 11:30','2024-07-01','yes','Conference Room (BSB 104)','','R.

IAQ can be impacted by pollutants from both indoor and outdoor sources. A significant challenge facing IAQ research is the fact that the indoor environment is highly variable, and the traditional approach of using research-grade air quality monitors cannot offer coverage for such heterogeneity. The recent development of low-cost air quality sensors opens up new avenues for IAQ research. The low cost enables the simultaneous deployment of multiple sensors across space and time, making new research strategies possible. In this presentation, I will provide an overview of three studies conducted by my research team to monitor IAQ using low-cost sensors. In the first project, we monitored IAQ in university-run student residences, which represented the first such measurement in Canada. The second project is an ongoing effort, in which we have deployed sensors in various buildings with the aim of understanding the infiltration of wildfire smoke in campus buildings. In the third and last project, we measured indoor air quality in a commercial poultry facility using low-cost sensors for the first time. In all of these examples, low-cost air quality sensors enabled IAQ monitoring at locations and situations that have not been explored previously. The accessibility of low-cost sensors also enabled a community-based, participatory approach to the projects. Our results offer far-reaching implications to how building management affects IAQ, which in turn, impinge on the health and well-being of residents, employees, and even animals in indoor settings.\r\n\r\nAbout the Speaker:\r\nDr. Ran Zhao received both of his Bachelor’s and PhD degrees in Environmental Chemistry at the University of Toronto, Canada. He worked as an NSERC postdoctoral fellow at California Institute of Technology before becoming an assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Alberta in 2018. His team is engaged in a wide range of research topics related to atmospheric chemistry, air quality, and climate change. Specific research directions include wildfire emissions, indoor air quality, cloudwater chemistry, and the development and application of low-cost air quality sensors. Dr. Zhao is the recipient of a number of awards, with the most recent ones being the 2023 Chemistry Professor of the Year Award, the 2023 Petro Canada Emerging Innovator Award, and the 2024 University Award for Outstanding Mentorship in Undergraduate Research.

While conventional wastewater treatment systems focus on meeting discharge limits, these processes are energy and chemical-intensive. Furthermore, the management of municipal organic solid waste and wastewater sludge is a growing issue. As a result, a paradigm shift from wastewater treatment as an end-of-pipe solution to a more holistic circularity-based system focusing on resource recovery is required. Therefore, the proposed research focuses on developing an integrated energy self-sufficient management system for wastewater and domestic organic waste to achieve the circular economy concept. Herein, we propose the separation of organic matter and water through a low energy-intensive direct membrane filtration, followed by recovery of value-added products such as energy, nutrients, biochar, etc. This seminar presents the feasibility of direct membrane filtration for organics recovery from wastewater. Also, the effect of contact tank pre-treatment is investigated on fouling mitigation. Furthermore, the recovery of energy as biohydrogen from the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge that can be concentrated after direct membrane filtration is discussed. The initial operating conditions and effectiveness of various pre-treatment methods are presented. Moreover, the suitability of co-digestion of sludge with other domestic organic waste is discussed. Finally, a predictive model for the biological hydrogen production potential of various organic waste mixtures is developed based on the initial substrate characteristics. ','R.

Permeability of the endothelium layer allows such deposition underneath, which narrows the blood vessel and obstructs the blood flow. These blockages are known as â€˜stenosisâ€™. A carotid artery is a large-sized artery which branches out from the aorta. Presence of blockages in the carotid artery leads to insufficient supply of oxygenated blood to the brain, with a lethal consequence in the form of ischemic stroke. Advanced imaging techniques have revealed that the blockage in the carotid artery is often eccentric and multiple in nature. This study aims to perform three-dimensional numerical computations for blood flow through a double stenosed carotid artery. The blood flow is considered as laminar, pulsatile, and non-Newtonian. Pulsatile flow with Womersley number (Wo) of 4.65 and Reynolds number (Re) of 425 has been considered. FVM based ANSYS Fluent 20.1 has been used as solver for solving the governing equations. For the two blockages, severity values of 40% and 60% based on diameter reduction have been permuted, giving rise to four combinations. For each combination, three values of interspacing in the multiples of normal artery diameter (D),viz. 4D, 6D and 8D have been considered. An eccentricity of 10% of diameter has been provided at the stenosis. The work also aims to analyse the effect of geometrical parameters of carotid bifurcation on characteristics of the flow. These geometrical parameters comprises bifurcation angle (Î²), planarity angle (Î±) and severity of stenosis (b). The range for geometric parameters was taken from the available clinical studies.  Instantaneous flow behaviour has been illustrated using iso-Q surfaces, vorticity, velocity, and helicity contours, whereas the time-averaged wall shear stress ((Ï„_w ) Ì…) and oscillatory shear index (OSI) quantify the time-averaged behaviour.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/toe-errp-qba','','',1,'2024-06-20 10:51:41','Active'),(612,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Design and fabrication of an electrothermally actuated MEMS mirror for microendoscopy.','Mr. SREERAJ P NAMBIAR (EE21S022)','MS Scholar','    Guide: Dr. Shanti Bhattacharya\r\n\r\n    Co-Guide:  Enakshi Bhattacharya','Electrical Engineering','2024/06/25 15:00','2024-06-25','yes','ESB 244 (hybrid mode)/ online','Owing to the progress in microfabrication techniques, MEMS devices have become more affordable and sophisticated.

Acoustic signals, elastic stress waves emitted by fracture processes, are valuable real-time information about the evolution of damage within the material from its initial state to its final collapse or failure. While this information has been qualitatively widely utilised in the identification of the type of fracture mechanisms, their onset and progression in both brittle as well as ductile materials, the quantitative analyses of acoustic emission (AE) data have focussed primarily on establishing the existence of scale-free behaviour and the associated power-law statistics. Predictive indicators from analyses of experimental AE data are vital in life assessment of existing structures, however, utilising AE data for design and development of robust structural systems requires predictive fracture models that incorporate disorder by utilising AE data in characterisation of its model parameters. \r\n\r\nDisorder in the form of compositional heterogeneity is of relevance in biological materials such as wood, bone, and nacre as they are inherently multi-phased in their constitution. In such natural materials, even with the same constituents, by controlling the relative proportion of the phases and their spatial arrangements, a wide range of effective mechanical and fracture properties can be achieved. For man-made materials, with advancements in manufacturing technologies, it is also possible to control and fine-tune the composition, even at the microscopic scale. There is continuing effort towards the development of novel multiphase materials that can be used in engineering applications and the determination of optimum combinations of phases as well as the development of better manufacturing techniques that induce minimal undesirable side effects. For reliable use, as well as optimum design of man-made multiphase solids, developing insights by modelling their fracture behavior assumes paramount significance.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed research work we attempt to answer the following questions: In tensile fracture simulations of a representative material, is it possible to estimate the disorder characteristics by utilising the statistical signatures of AE data? In the fracture of multiphase solids, is the observed enhancement in mode-I toughness strongly dependent on the ratio of elastic moduli? Do the mechanisms that operate in mode I also occur in mixed mode, and is the enhancement similar? How are the avalanche statistics different from a single-phase disordered solid? And is there any transition between the fracture types at different compositions? \r\n','HoD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/vrd-fmyd-rcg','','',1,'2024-06-20 11:45:53','Active'),(614,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','A Study of Self-Heating Effect and Related Parameter Extraction in SiGe HBTs','Mr. Sovan Barman (EE21S011)','MS Scholar','Guide: Prof.Anjan Chakravorty (IITM),\r\nCo-Guide: Prof.Suresh Balanethiram (NIT Puducherry)','Electrical Engineering','2024/07/01 11:00','2024-07-01','yes','ESB 244','Silicon-germanium heterojunction bipolar transistors (SiGe HBTs) have been a serious contender for RF and sub-mm-applications because of their excellent capability to operate at high current and high frequency regime. For power amplifier applications, multi-finger SiGe HBTs realized in modern BiCMOS processes are regularly used. Since such devices operate at high current densities, resulting self-heating effects (SHE) seriously influence the device operation other than posing long-term reliability issues. The elevated temperature caused by the SHE alters the operating point by modifying the temperature sensitive state variables within the devices. From the perspective of equivalent circuit models, parameter values are altered due to the SHE, posing a serious challenge to accurately extract the electrical and thermal network related parameters at nominal temperature.\r\n\r\nIn this seminar, first of all we present a systematic procedure to extract thermal resistances and capacitances in a multi-node thermal network model to accurately capture the SHE in SiGe HBTs.

The noise pollution variations and their exposure patterns are challenging to understand because of their high spatial and temporal variations. Seminar I presented the results of both stationary and mobile measurements which were carried out at selected locations in Chennai city to characterise urban noise pollution. The results of a noise dosimeter study and a questionnaire survey conducted to determine the personal exposure parameters and assess people\'s perceptions of noise pollution were also described in Seminar I.  This seminar demonstrates the quantification of health effects associated with road traffic noise in two major Indian metropolitan cities: Chennai and Delhi, based on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The results show that road traffic noise was estimated to cause 1.5 lakhs DALYs in Chennai and 1.32 lakhs DALYs in Delhi. In terms of economic impact, the calculated annual health costs amounted to INR 32,000 crores and INR 28,000 crores for Chennai and Delhi, respectively. Additionally, we have calculated that a hypothetical uniform reduction of road traffic noise by 3 dB(A) could potentially prevent 19% of this disease burden in Chennai and 27% of the disease burden in Delhi. The seminar also includes modelling and mapping of noise levels at selected locations using predictive modelling approach. Three scenarios were analyzed: without noise protection, with a noise protection berm, and with foliage as noise protection. Results indicated significant noise reduction (3 dB(A) on an average) with the use of noise protection berms, particularly near major roads, while foliage was less effective.','R.

It is a novel anti-cancer drug belonging to a class of monoterpene indole alkaloid. It works by inhibiting DNA topoisomerase I activity in cancer cells leading to cell death. The endophytes, microorganisms residing in plants have the ability to produce host-plant associated metabolites. The fungal endophytes serve as the alternative sources of camptothecin production. The bottleneck is that there has been inconsistent product yield from these fungal endophytes and is reported to be lost with successive subculture under axenic state. In this context, we will be discussing about the various strategies that can be adapted to enhance the impeded yield of camptothecin.

Using stakeholder, signaling, and reputation management theories, this study develops arguments favoring faculty as the stakeholder group for obtaining the weightages and uses a robust empirical method to assimilate the individual faculty responses in the case of National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), a government established ranking metric for educational institutions in India. This work uses the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making method (MCDM) of Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP), employing group aggregation techniques for a large number of faculty members, who are the most proximal and influential stakeholder group in B-schools. The study thereafter evaluates the consensus of the obtained responses for agreement, further validated by sensitivity analysis to establish if the obtained values were robust. Significant gaps were identified among the existing weights of NIRF and the collective faculty group in equity and inclusion criteria, classroom teaching, consultancy, projects and executive programs, resource utilization, research output and graduate outcomes. Yet, weightages for faculty qualification, campus placements and graduate salaries were similar. While financial utilization was accorded less importance, B-school â€˜perceptionâ€™ was weighted higher than before. The prioritization of criteria by faculty members accurately focused on the most pressing problems facing B-schools within the context of the study.\r\n\r\nThe advantages posed by this work is that the proposed method is scalable, replicable, logically coherent and justifiable, and can be adapted to a variety of contexts and stakeholder groups. The method potentially allows aggregated assimilation of a large number of respondents, incorporating a framework where individual preferences are accounted for. It can also be claimed that larger and more diversified samples can yield different results, as would a different set of indexes under consideration/ evaluation. The work is highly adaptable to context. Furthermore, evaluation of other stakeholder groups like students/ aspirants, and employers might yield a different but richer result. This study is unique in aggregating the responses of a large number of participants using FAHP. The use of Shannon entropy method for consensus estimation is also a unique and novel addition to evaluative methods employing AHP. This research is an atypical method of weight conception in ranking, highlighting differences between government policymaking and ground realities in a regional context, pinpointing specific areas for focused intervention.\r\n\r\nKeywords: B-School Ranking, Fuzzy AHP, Shannon Beta-Entropy, Parameter Weightages, Signaling Theory, MCDM, Reputation Management\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-21 04:43:53','Active'),(620,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€™ ROLE OF BRAND SUPER â€“ EFFORTS AND POSITIVE EMOTIIONS DURING EXOGENOUS BRAND CRISIS: MACRO- MESO-MICRO PERSPECTIVEâ€™â€™ ','Ms. P.

Anchoring on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) theory, this study aims to investigate the impact of exogenous brand crises (EBC) and brandâ€™s responses on the affective and behavioural changes of consumers. To achieve research objectives, this research employs a mixed method six study approach. Firstly, the extensive EBC types are catalogued, and a typology is developed (Study 1) through review of extant literature and secondary data analysis. Following, exploratory studies, wherein repertory grid technique (RGT) based interviews (Study 2) and collage construction (Study 3) were conducted to identify the most significant EBC and the key constructs that impact consumer purchase decisions. Based on these findings, a multi-level approach - involving brand (macro), consumer (micro) and brand community (meso) - is adapted for the breadth of EBC: pervasive (context a â€“ Covid-19) and localised impact (context b â€“ Earthquake).\r\n\r\nFor macro level, â€˜super-effortsâ€™ (G. Siomkos & Shrivastava, 1993) are used while meso level is represented through brand evangelism (Matzler et al., 2007) and micro perspective is measured through consumer responses of brand attitude and purchase intention (Spears & Singh, 2004). Exploring the interrelations, experiment (Study 4a,b) investigates the macro-micro interactions of brand super-efforts and brand authenticity on consumer responses, through the mediation of positive emotions (hope/empathy) and moderation of thinking style. Following, survey (Study 5a,b) examines the macro-meso affiliations of community members and their evangelism towards brand super-efforts. Final experiment (Study 6a,b) explores the macro-meso-micro integration through combined impact of brand super-effort, brand evangelism and brand authenticity, on consumer emotions and responses.\r\n\r\nThe findings highlight that during pervasive EBC brand super-efforts will impact consumer hope and responses, while during localised EBC brand authenticity will impact consumer empathy and responses. Specifically, for less authentic brands, community membersâ€™ evangelism aids brand super-efforts in building consumer empathy and influencing their purchase decisions. Thus, the research provides a comprehensive approach towards EBC management involving multiple levels that will enable brand managers to effectively navigate through the challenges and seize the opportunities posed by the EBC.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-21 05:06:48','Active'),(621,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','Building 2-level learning and reasoning systems: Neurosymbolic sequential decision-making','Prof. Sriraam Natarajan','Dr. Sriraam Natarajan is a Professor and the Director for Center for ML at the Department of Computer Science at University of Texas Dallas, a hessian.AI fellow at TU Darmstadt and a RBDSCAII Distinguished Faculty Fellow at IIT Madras.

Under normal physiological conditions vascular tone, permeability and fluidity, are tightly regulated by the endothelium for maintaining vascular homeostasis. Insulin is known to regulate this process via two signaling pathways: the PI3K/Akt pathway and the MAPK pathway. The metabolic milieu of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in diabetes, leads to pathway-specific impairment of the endothelial insulin-signaling causing endothelial dysfunction which is a key contributor of macro- and micro-vascular diabetic complications such as nephropathy and cardiomyopathy. Pancreastatin (PST) is a 52-mer peptide endogenously-derived from the proteolytic cleavage of the neuroendocrine hormone Chromogranin A (CHGA). Several studies have demonstrated the dysglycemic and anti-insulin effects of PST, with its naturally occurring Gly297Ser variant being associated with a ~1.4 -fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes in an Indian population, as previously studied by us. However, the mechanism underlying the increased risk for diabetes remains poorly understood since the structures of the PST-wild-type (PST-WT) and Gly297Ser (PST-G297S) peptides remain to be solved. CD spectroscopy revealed that PST-G297S had higher propensity to form Î±-helices, and in silico molecular docking studies suggested a higher binding affinity for the insulin binding pocket of the insulin receptor as compared to the wild-type peptide. In this study, we aim to experimentally determine the structural differences between PST-WT and PST-G297S peptides and their differential interaction with the insulin receptor, and thereby study their functional implications such as effects on the insulin signaling pathway and on endothelial dysfunction.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-21 08:57:53','Active'),(624,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Thermal Modeling Of Multi-Finger Silicon-Germanium Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors',' Mr. Aakashdeep Gupta (EE15D209)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Anjan Chakravorty ','Electrical Engineering','2024/06/26 11:00','2024-06-26','yes','Online (Googlemeet)','\r\nCritical advantages offered by Silicon-Germanium Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors (SiGe HBTs) include operation up to several GHz frequencies, attractive figure-of-merits, and integration with the existing CMOS technology nodes, and these put forward SiGe HBTs as a versatile and competitive bipolar technology. Multi-finger SiGe HBTs are usually preferred for power amplifier circuits operating at high frequency and low and medium power. However, they suffer from pronounced electro-thermal heating resulting from aggressive down-scaling, shallow and deep trenches, and high current operations.

Stereo depth estimation relies on stereo matching, where depth is inferred by matching corresponding pixels in stereo image pairs to calculate disparity. Key to stereo matching is the cost volume, representing dissimilarity between pixel pairs, which poses computational challenges. We propose two convolutional neural network-based architectures, SDE-DualENet and 2T-UNet, which circumvent the cost volume construction step and preset maximum disparity parameter dependencies in stereo depth estimation. While the former method eliminates the need for cost-volume, the latter additionally integrates monocular depth information to improve scene geometry prediction, achieving better performance on challenging datasets.\r\nWe also address the limitations faced by stereo depth estimation techniques in capturing the intricacies of scenes in high dynamic range imaging. The recent trend in industries and research communities seek to merge 3D and HDR technologies for immersive viewing experiences. Creating cost-effective 3D HDR content requires accurate depth estimation, which is challenging due to SDR cameras\' limited sensitivity and complex natural scenes. We address this by proposing a dual-encoder single-decoder convolutional neural network, which excels in learning the disparity while efficiently merging disparity maps obtained from stereo images at varying exposure levels developing an efficient multi-exposure stereo depth estimation framework. \r\nFinally, we address the limitations of supervised low-light image enhancement methods, which require paired datasets of low and normal light images that are difficult to capture in real-world conditions. We present ELEGAN, a lightweight generative adversarial network which employs self-regularized illumination attention mapping and modified residual dense blocks to restore low-light images, reducing noise and enhancing visual quality in real-world scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our proposed methods through qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis with state-of-the-art techniques.\r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://sites.google.com/view/sharmamansi/','','',1,'2024-06-21 11:42:27','Active'),(629,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\"On Noncommutative Convexity\"','Ms. Neha Hotwani, MA18D016','Research Scholar, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','DC Members: Dr. R.

As effective cooling strategies become critical in highly miniaturized electronic devices, accurately predicting boiling regimes is essential for safety and efficiency. Boiling acoustics plays a crucial role in identifying transitions between boiling regimes, with spectral analysis revealing key patterns. Experimental studies using heated wires of varying diameters have shown distinctive amplitude and frequency changes across different pool boiling regimes. The dominant acoustic frequencies around 2000 Hz are especially crucial, while varying heat fluxes impact amplitude without significantly altering dominant frequencies. Despite minimal influence from heater wire diameter, smaller gauges exhibited higher-frequency components, underscoring the complexity of these systems. \r\n \r\nMachine learning models significantly enhance the predictive capabilities of these diagnostics. Experiments using wire heaters classified three pool boiling regimes: no boiling, nucleate boiling, and critical heat flux. Among several machine learning methods tested, the decision tree ensemble provided the most accurate results with minimal classification error and inference time. Accurate classification leads to safer, more efficient real-time monitoring of cooling systems. Combining acoustic, vibration, and high-speed imaging data provides a more holistic understanding of boiling phenomena. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) helped uncover patterns in bubble behaviour and boiling modes. Boiling-induced vibrations and acoustic signatures are essential for capturing changes in bubble dynamics and phase transitions in boiling. The integration of acoustic and vibration diagnostics with machine learning leads to a better classification of boiling-induced phenomena that conventional methods often miss.\r\n \r\nBoiling-induced vibrations for flow boiling scenarios add another layer of critical insights into boiling behaviour. Spectral analysis of these vibrations identified dominant frequencies between 6.5 and 12.5 kHz, with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models showing high predictive accuracy in estimating heat loads in flow boiling conditions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) highlighted that the 8-9 kHz frequency peaks are particularly indicative.\r\n \r\nThis research shows that using boiling acoustics, vibration analysis, and imaging diagnostics with machine learning creates a strong method for identifying and predicting different boiling states. Accurately recognizing these states and spotting critical heat flux is key to building safer, more efficient autonomous cooling systems for new electronics. By blending advanced diagnostic tools with modern computational models, this approach could significantly change how we understand boiling heat transfer.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','The research has been published in the following articles:  1.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icheatmasstr','seminar22-06-2024 07:39','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar22-06-2024 07:39',1,'2024-06-22 07:39:44','Active'),(632,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\"Experimental and Numerical Comparisons among Various Skewed Blades of Low Speed Axial Fan Rotors',' Mr. Ankit Bhai Patel, Roll No. ME15D202','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide:-  Dr. Viswanath K, ME, IIT Madras','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/06/28 10:00','2024-06-28','yes','Through Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/iav-rjzw-vdf','','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/iav-rjzw-vdf','','',1,'2024-06-22 07:43:20','Active'),(633,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED DESIGN METHODOLOGIES FOR AUTOMOTIVE CRASHWORTHINESS','Mr. Peddi Sai Rama Narayana, Roll No. ME19D043','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide -  Prof. V.

It\r\nbecomes essential to have vibration control in critical zones where sensitive electronic\r\nequipment is mounted, which are used for control and guidance. Vibration isolators are\r\nnatural choices to reduce the amplification or containment of response of vibration at the\r\nrequired places.\r\nTwo types of elastomeric vibration isolators used for equipment vibration isolation in\r\naerospace vehicles are considered for the present study. These isolators are constructed\r\nusing elastomers mounted in steel encasings. The structural configurations of each is\r\ndifferent and mass rating of Type-A isolator is 2.25 kg and that of Type-B isolator is 4.5\r\nkg. These isolators are initially deformed statically and dynamic loads are applied on the\r\ndeformed configuration.\r\nTo capture the static deformation, equivalent static load corresponding to its load rating\r\nand specified displacements are created. Static deformation is computed using Finite\r\nElement methods with four node axi-symmetric elements which include the geometric\r\nnonlinear effect for steel and with standard Yeoh hyper-elastic material model for\r\nelastomers. Yeoh material constants are derived from uni-axial tension test data of the\r\nelastomer specimen. These isolators are subjected to harmonic and random excitations in\r\nthe pre-deformed state. For numerical analysis, elastomeric constants at dynamic\r\nconditions are obtained as complex function of frequency using Dynamic Mechanical\r\nAnalyzer (DMA) for a range of frequencies. The standard material model of Yeoh is\r\n\r\nv\r\n\r\nmodified incorporating frequency dependant material characteristics and damping in the\r\nrange of frequencies of interest. A multiplicative non-separable variables law is derived\r\nfor Yeoh material model to include the effect of static pre-stress, based on the methodology\r\ngiven in literature. The modifications of Yeoh model suitable for frequency domain\r\nanalysis is the novelty in the present study. In the analysis, while dynamic loads are\r\napplied, the configuration is updated considering initial static loading. The frequency\r\nresponse of the isolators is computed using material properties evaluated at progressive\r\ndynamic strains until a match in natural frequency is observed. Appropriate damping\r\ncorrections are then incorporated to match the test observed transmissibility. Then updated\r\nmaterial properties are used to compute the random response which showed good\r\nagreement with results of experiments, validating the approach taken for the development\r\nof this model.\r\n\r\nFor the case of transient response, the internal forces generated are in the frequency\r\ndomain and external forces are applied in the time domain. To bring uniformity in the\r\nequation, the time domain transient load is transformed to frequency domain using Fast\r\nFourier Transform (FFT) and response of the isolator is obtained in the frequency domain.\r\nThis frequency domain response is transformed back to time domain using Inverse FFT\r\n(IFFT). The response obtained in this process represents the transient response. The Finite\r\nElement formulation provided for the frequency domain response is used to study the\r\nisolators for rectangular and trapezium pulse loads and sinusoidally varying loads.\r\nNumerical results are validated with experimental observations for rectangular pulse load.\r\nA good match is observed between the experimental and numerical results.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','KEYWORDS: Vibration Isolation; Hyper-Elastic material; Yeoh Material model; Frequency Response; Tran','','',1,'2024-06-23 07:15:43','Active'),(636,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Solvent-Responsive Bio-Polymer Thin Film Actuatorsthrough Interface Engineering for Soft GripperDesign','Mr. Rajesh Kumar Meena, Roll No. ME15D047','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide - Prof. Ratna Kumar Annabattula V V S D, ME, IITM','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/06/27 11:30','2024-06-27','yes',' Through Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/kcy-ertx-rmd','In this work, we design and analyze bi-layer polymeric thin film systems computation-\r\nally and experimentally which have several applications in soft robotics and biomedical\r\n\r\nengineering. We investigate two major problems where polymeric systems undergo\r\nbending/folding due to the development of concentration gradient when exposed to the\r\nsolvent. We perform experiments and simulations to elucidate the characteristics of the\r\ndesigned structure.\r\nFirst, we report the role of an embedded interface between two polymer thin films in\r\ndetermining the overall folding and actuation characteristics of a bilayer system applied\r\nfor gripping submerged objects. Along with the material properties and geometry of the\r\n\r\nindividual films involved, the strength of the embedded interface governs the folding be-\r\nhaviour of the bilayer when exposed to a solvent. The concentration gradient developed\r\n\r\nacross the film thickness when exposed to the solvent results in the deformation of the\r\nfilm. The evolution of concentration through the film thickness as a function of time is\r\nclosely related to the interface strength. It affects various aspects of the deformation,\r\nsuch as the direction of folding, curvature attained, and actuation rate. In this work, we\r\n\r\nhave varied the strength of the interface between solvent responsive chitosan and hy-\r\ndrophobic Poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) by treating the substrate (chitosan) with\r\n\r\nvarying concentrations of silane before coating. Experimentally, the folding character-\r\nistics of the solvent responsive bilayer films have been investigated for four different\r\n\r\ninterfacial strengths. A coupled diffusion-deformation model for the film and a cohe-\r\nsive zone model for the interface is developed to provide insights into the underlying\r\n\r\nmechanism behind the observations made. Finally, the application of the bilayer as a\r\n\r\ngripper for submerged objects for two different types of interfaces is demonstrated. In-\r\niii\r\n\r\nterestingly, in this approach, the medium where the object is immersed acts as a trigger\r\nfor folding the grippers.\r\n\r\nSecond, Self-folding in biopolymer thin films is reported as a reversible and irre-\r\nversible phenomenon when the polymer film is exposed to its responsive solvent like\r\n\r\nwater, temperature, humidity, heat, vapour etc. In this present work, we develop a\r\nframework with the help of experiments and simulation results for a water-responsive\r\n\r\nbilayer thin film. We vary interfacial mechanical properties, such as the diffusion co-\r\nefficient and Youngâ€™s modulus, based on a coupled diffusion-deformation mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis mechanism alters the folding behavior of a bilayer interface thin film. The curva-\r\nture of a bi-layer film depends on interfacial material properties. The interface material\r\n\r\nproperties play a crucial role in the folding behaviour of bi-layer thin films. The ex-\r\nperimental and simulation studies are done which all show a good correlation between\r\n\r\nthem. The bi-layer interface thin film is made of cross-linked chitosan. Having varying\r\ncross-linking results in different forms of interface, which in turn results in different\r\n\r\nmaterial properties for the interface material that lies between the top and bottom chi-\r\ntosan layers of the film. The folding behaviour can be altered by simply switching the\r\n\r\nmaterial properties interface. It is found that these interface helps to design on-demand\r\nsoft actuators which can be designed based on the actuation rate and curvature of the\r\nbi-layer interface thin film. In this diffuse interface configuration, a reversible folding\r\ngripper has been designed to function effectively underwater as well.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','KEYWORDS: Bio-Polymer thin film, embedded interface, bilayer, cohesive zone, concentration gradient,','','',1,'2024-06-23 07:41:31','Active'),(637,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Surface Design of Additively Manufactured Polyether Ether Ketone for Sliding-Bearing Applications','Mr. Sunil Kumar Prajapati, Roll No. ME18D044','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide:-  Prof. R.

In structural applications such\r\nas gears, sleeves, and bushes, advanced semicrystalline polymers like\r\npolyetheretherketone (PEEK) are preferred due to their excellent mechanical\r\nproperties. However, the performance of PEEK as bearings and gears is governed by\r\nits tribological properties, and is significantly influenced by the contact surface of the\r\nmaterial with other polymers or metals. When it comes to additively manufactured\r\nparts, the surface properties of PEEK samples play a crucial role in determining their\r\nfriction and wear behaviour as they differ from conventionally manufactured samples.\r\nThe contact surface, roughness, hardness, and porosity of additively manufactured\r\nPEEK samples are significant factors to consider when these parts come into contact\r\nwith metals under dry sliding conditions. The presence of asperities on the surface of\r\nthe samples leads to variations in the wear response under abrasive and adhesive\r\nconditions. This implies that the tribological behaviour of additively manufactured\r\nPEEK parts may deviate from that of traditionally manufactured parts due to the\r\ncharacteristics of the additive manufacturing process.\r\n\r\nThe hard particles of the abrasive surface cause high initial wear of the 3D\r\nprinted PEEK sample. The surface properties and shape significantly affect the wear\r\nrate and friction performance of the samples. The sample with high surface roughness\r\nand low hardness showed a higher friction coefficient and wear rate, which implies the\r\nsamples fabricated with a layer thickness of more than half of the nozzle diameter of\r\nprinter exhibits different surface properties. The surface properties like hardness and\r\nwater contact angle decrease with increase in layer thickness, which affects the wear\r\nloss.\r\n\r\niv\r\n\r\nThe surface of steel sliding against PEEK was found to be dependent on other\r\nparameters. The top surface 3D printed sample deposited with a specific pattern and\r\ninfill density was tested and compared with an extruded rod sample. The change in\r\nsliding direction with respect to the infill pattern of 3D printed sample surface exhibits\r\ndifferent friction coefficients and wear rates. The dry sliding in a perpendicular\r\ndirection to the infill was found to have greater wear resistance. The variation of the\r\nsurface structure due to deceased infill density affects the surface properties and contact\r\ncharacteristics. The decrease in infill density causes an increase in wear rate to the 3D\r\nprinted samples at constant loading conditions.\r\n\r\nThe increase in wear rate was also found when tested with grease lubrication.\r\nAdding lubrication under adhesive wear conditions affects the friction and wear\r\nresponse with proper lubrication and starved conditions. The variation in sliding speed\r\nlowers the friction coefficient for a particular sample, while decreased infill density\r\ncauses a higher friction coefficient value for 3D printed samples. The surface porosity\r\nformed due to the additive manufacturing process helps the sample store lubricant and\r\nsupply it when needed. The sample with 90 % infill density was found to perform better\r\nin dry and lubricated conditions. On the other hand, the sample with 80 % infill\r\nperformed better under starvation conditions.\r\n\r\nAbrasive wear is a severe phenomenon that damages the surface and affects\r\n\r\nsliding performance. An ANN model is used to predict the abrasive wear loss in 3D-\r\nprinted PEEK samples. The prediction fits better with the wear trend and predicts the\r\n\r\nwear loss with higher accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe present study reports on the effect of various surface features possible in\r\nthe additive manufacturing process through the filament extrusion on the tribological\r\nproperties that will aid in selecting the appropriate surface for required operating\r\noptions. The different types of contact conditions, abrasive, adhesive under dry,\r\nlubricated, and starving conditions, are investigated, and micromechanisms of wear are\r\nreproted.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','KEYWORDS: Additive Manufacturing, Lubrication, PEEK, Printing parameters,  Surface properties, Tribo','','',1,'2024-06-23 07:48:09','Active'),(638,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Passive Acoustic Monitoring for Marine Biodiversity and Arctic Climate Change Studies','Dr. Hari Vishnu','Hari is a Senior Research Fellow at the Acoustic Research Laboratory, National University of Singapore.

The first will look at monitoring marine mammals in Singapore waters. Marine mammals such as dolphins are known to produce acoustic vocalizations for several purposes including foraging, navigation and communication. The waters of East and South-East Asia are inhabited by many dolphin species, including Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and bottlenose dolphins. PAM is effective for detecting and quantifying these marine-mammals via their vocalizations, because sound travels far in the ocean, and sound data is relatively cheap and easy to collect. Using this for marine-mammal detection and quantification often involves sifting through large amounts of data searching for specific types of dolphin calls amidst different types of background noise, where specialized machine-learning based algorithms can play an important role. In Singapore waters, this problem is made more challenging due to the presence of large amount of background biological noise, as well as shipping noise. This talk will discuss the development of a machine-learning based PAM system attuned to the unique noise environment in Singapore used for detecting dolphin vocalizations,  and the challenges faced and learnings gained during this. The second part will focus on using passive acoustics to understand the climate-change induced ice-loss mechanisms at marine-terminating glaciers. In these regions where the glaciers meet the ocean, ice is lost through a combination of mechanisms. However, since studying the glacier terminus directly is hazardous, and these regions are often inaccessible or infeasible to access, remote sensing is essential to understand ice melt activity.

Roughness of order less than a nanometer are difficult to obtain using conventional machining processes. We propose an alternate method to reduce the roughness of glass and silicon substrates by using material addition process. Reduction of roughness could be achieved if nano-crevices of substrates are filled by a suitable material. First-principles DFT studies, shows that the enthalpy of the formation of neutral clusters is very low for the clusters of zinc with 2-7 atoms compared to that of other transition metal element clusters with the same number of atoms.  Hence Zinc could fill nano crevices in substrates and can be used as a filler material to reduce the roughness. By using a specific sequence of deposition and annealing of filler material, smooth transparent substrates can be obtained. \r\n\r\nZinc was deposited on glass and silicon wafers using a DC magnetron sputtering system. The surface morphology of the deposited samples was observed using an atomic force microscope (AFM), and optical transmittance was measured using UV-visible spectroscopy. AFM results of silicon wafer show a reduction of surface roughness from Rq = 0.717 nm for bare silicon substrates to Rq = 0.129 nm for zinc-deposited substrates. Roughness of glass reduced from Rq = 0.590 nm for bare substrates to Rq = 0.174 nm for zinc-deposited substrates. The transparency of glass substrates also improved because of the reduced roughness.','MME OFFICE','mmoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-24 04:55:14','Active'),(640,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- தீ (thee)\r\nHindi word	- आग, अग्नि (aag, agni (ஆக், அக்னி)\r\nEnglish word	 - Fire\r\n','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-06-24 05:00:44','default_value'),(641,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','ASSESSMENT OF DEMAND CONTROLLED VENTILATION AND PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS ON OCCUPANTS EXPOSED TO ELEVATED CO2 CONCENTRATION','Mr. S.

Among other things, beyond 5G and 6G networks envision ubiquitous global network coverage, i.e., coverage of every location on the planet, including the remotest areas of the world. While ubiquitous global coverage has many use cases, such as military surveillance, global cargo movement, and weather monitoring, installing conventional cellular infrastructure in remote areas is not justified, both in terms of capital expenditure and utilization. In such situations, Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a cost-effective and efficient alternative.\r\n \r\n UAVs can be utilised to provide Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) services to the Internet of Remote Things (IoRT) devices spread over a remote area. In the existing literature, two alternative locations for placing MEC  have been suggested - on the UAV and on the satellite. There are some works in which a combination of both alternatives is used. However, both alternatives are inefficient in terms of energy consumption.  Alternately, we propose placing the MEC device on the ground while using a UAV to relay the data collected from IoRT devices to the MEC device. The proposed alternative is more energy efficient, albeit with a slight decrease in the average system capacity compared to placing the MEC on the UAV.\r\n\r\nThe data collected from IoRT devices needs to be processed to extract useful information from it and relevant output data, besides control information, may have to be sent back to the IoRT devices. Therefore, we propose a full-fledged architecture to provide MEC services to IoRT devices using multiple UAVs, considering the two-way movement of data. The UAVs relay the data generated by the IoRT devices to the MEC device located on the ground at a nearby location. After carrying out computations, the MEC device sends the results back to the IoRT devices via the UAVs. We provide a heuristic solution to jointly optimize the UAV trajectory planning, connection scheduling, bit transmission scheduling, bandwidth allocation, and power control for the proposed architecture to minimize total energy consumption while maximizing the system throughput.\r\n\r\nBesides ubiquitous connectivity, the UAVs are also leveraged in performing user offloading from one gNodeB (base station in 5G networks) to another in hotspot scenarios, i.e., when the traffic load is so high that Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations occur. Offloading the users to neighbouring gNodeB by borrowing the unused bandwidth of the neighbouring gNodeB leads to co-channel interference, as the same frequencies are used by every gNodeB. Therefore, we propose a novel UAV-aided cellular user offloading that uses Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receivers to mitigate the co-channel interference. As SIC is used at the receivers, it is important to optimize the number and locations of the UAVs, load redistribution among the gNodeBs, power allocation, bandwidth allocation, and user association. We propose a heuristic solution to perform the joint optimization of the aforementioned parameters while minimizing the total cost of SLA violations. Our proposed solution increases the spectral efficiency, decreases the total cost of SLA violations, and can be used in both cell-centred and cell-edge users.\r\n\r\nWhile the SIC-based solution is effective for offloading the unblocked cellular users, the same cannot be said for power-constrained devices and blocked cellular users. Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) technology can be used to reach the blocked users. Therefore, we propose using a UAV mounted with two IRS panels to offload the blocked users while minimizing the co-channel interference. We propose a heuristic solution to jointly optimize the location of the UAV, user association, phase shifts of the IRS elements, transmit power allocation, and bandwidth allocation while offloading the blocked users. The proposed solution decreases the number of SLA violations and improves the overall spectral efficiency.\r\n\r\n','CS Office','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/fer-hbsu-seu','','',1,'2024-06-24 06:18:55','Active'),(643,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','MECHANICAL AND DURABILITY CHARACTERIZATION OF TEXTILE REINFORCED CONCRETE','Mr. Sachin Paul, Roll No. CE16D001','Ph.D Scholar','Dr. Ravindra Gettu - Guide, Dr. Dali Naidu Arnepalli -  Co-Guide, Dr. K.P.

The process induces physical and chemical transformations of organic molecules under sub-critical or supercritical water. However, there are various challenges associated with HTL, especially to intensify the process by minimizing the waste streams and improving the product value. Aqueous phase is one of the major product streams in HTL and it is vital to reuse and valorize it for process sustainability and economic operation. Other challenges include the HTL of real heterogeneous waste feedstocks and demonstrating the applications of HTL products. Importantly, the literature on HTL of heterogeneous feedstocks like municipal solid wastes, or mixed industrial wastes is very limited. In addition to this, majority of the HTL studies around the world focus on the fundamental studies of HTL, but fail to demonstrate the valorization of the different product streams into value-added chemicals or fuels. This doctoral thesis addresses these challenges and research gaps pertaining to HTL.\r\n In the first section, use of freshwater for HTL was eliminated by the use of seawater, wastewater and aqueous phase recirculation, and their effects on product yields and quality were studied. In the second section, HTL of real heterogenous wastes such as black liquor from paper and pulp mills, as well as a variety of plastics were demonstrated and the effect of operating conditions on product yields and quality were studied in detail. In the final section, real applications of HTL products as fuels and chemicals are demonstrated. A detailed study on a real plastic waste (polycarbonate) was conducted to maximize the production of industrially relevant chemicals, mainly phenol, by optimizing the operating parameters and by intensifying the HTL process by the use of catalyst and AP recirculation. Finally, application of HTL crude oil as transportation fuel was also demonstrated. Real heterogenous industrial wastes were co-liquefied using industrial wastewater to produce diesel blends. The bio-crude-diesel blends are tested for their compatibility and efficiency in diesel engines, thus presenting an end-to-end approach from wastes to diesel-range fuels.  \r\nKeywords: Hydrothermal liquefaction, biomass, plastics, industrial wastes,\r\n   platform chemicals, sustainable fuels','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/jpv-hjyz-wfm','seminar24-06-2024 08:12','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar24-06-2024 08:12',1,'2024-06-24 08:12:26','Active'),(650,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\"Periodic Travelling  Wave Solutions of Some Non-Linear PDEs.\"','Mr. Krishna Patra, MA19D007','Research Scholar, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','DC Members: Dr. A J Shaiju / Dr. Srinivasa Rao Manam / Dr. Prasad Patnaik BSV ( AM)\r\nGuide: Dr. C.

However, the interference between data mapped to the Last Level Cache (LLC) from different cores can be detrimental. This interference often results in premature eviction and thrashing, leading to reduced system throughput. Performance can be significantly enhanced by maintaining the working set of applications that can fit within the cache, while also allocating cache space for parts of the working set from remaining applications.\r\n\r\nWe introduce a novel, application-aware, coarse-grained cache replacement policy named Address Translation Aware Re-reference Interval Prediction (ATARRIP). This policy incorporates a newly defined metric, High Reuse Distance (HRD) pages, calculated during the address translation phase. We employ the HRD pages metric to predict application behavior, thereby refining our cache replacement decisions. Our empirical findings indicate that ATARRIP surpasses the previously established state-of-the-art coarse-grained policy for multi-core systems, TADRRIP, in multi-core systems both with and without prefetchers. Additionally, ATARRIP achieves performance comparable to some fine-grained policies such as SHIP, and is only marginally outperformed by others like Hawkeye. ATARRIP managed shared cache achieves significant improvements over SRRIP on both 4-core and 8-core systems, with approximately half the storage overhead compared to the traditional LRU policy for a 16-way set associative LLC.','Hema G','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-24 10:25:55','Active'),(652,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','â€œDEVELOPMENT OF INDIGENOUS HETEROGENEOUS CATALYTIC PROCESS FOR HYDROGENATION OF HTPB (HYDROXYL TERMINATED POLYBUTADIENE)â€','MR.

Heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation is very advantageous technique for hydrogenating polymers. This work outlines the synthesis of hydrogenated HTPB (HHTPB) using HTPB polymer as a precursor by catalytic hydrogenation method using iso-propyl alcohol as the solvent media.  A novel synthesis approach to hydrogenate HTPB has been developed using a catalyst made up of palladium and zirconium as base metals supported on activated charcoal. Experiments were conducted in a 100 ml reactor with a magnetically driven variable speed impeller. Various parameters like operating temperature, operating pressure, solvent-to-feed ratio, and the concentration of the catalyst were optimized by conducting multiple experiments. The composition and microstructure of the in-house synthesized catalyst were characterized using SEM and TEM, XRD, and particle size distribution. HTPB and HHTPB polymers were characterized by NMR, FTIR, and chemical analysis. The results showed that the degree of hydrogenation of HTPB is greater than 79% for the optimized operating parameters and the reactor volume with the chosen operating conditions. After hydrogenation of HTPB, an insignificant change in hydroxyl value was observed, and the HHTPB formed is of vinyl-type functional isomer. A slight increase in molecular weight was observed after hydrogenation.

Throughout the operation, due to the fatigue loading, inherent flaws may come at different locations of the riveted joint, predominantly at rivet holes, which can significantly impact their structural integrity. To address this kind of real-life problem where the components include initial cracks, fracture mechanics approach, i.e., the study of Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) and the effect of other parameters on it has to be considered. This study explores the behavior of 3-2-1 Lozenge pattern riveted joints under uniaxial and biaxial loading, incorporating the Maximum Energy Release Rate (MERR) based crack advancement and its\' significant effect on the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) and crack path. \r\nIn the initial case, three interference levels, 0%, 0.1%, and 0.15% between rivet pin and hole, were considered, and the initial crack and its propagation according to the MERR criteria is studied at different rivet hole locations under uniaxial loading. Then, the effective SIF was analyzed using a cruciform specimen, considering load ratios of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 under biaxial loading. The effect of crack shadowing in the reduction of SIF at primary cracks is also studied. \r\nBased on this study, MERR criteria yielded more SIF and a significant deviation in the crack path, indicating a particular crack length\'s higher severity than the plane\'s perpendicular crack path estimate. The study identified the single rivet hole at the end of the pattern as the most critical, with a maximum effective SIF increase of 70% under equibiaxial loading and significant reductions in SIF with decreasing load ratios. This work further revealed that the presence of shadow cracks resulted in a notable reduction of the SIF at the primary crack.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/xea-snem-npu ','','',1,'2024-06-24 15:12:05','Active'),(656,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Mitigation of White Etching Areas Formation in Wind Turbine Gearbox Bearing Steel','Mr. Linto Davis, Roll No. ME18D017','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide:-  Prof. P.

The rate of failures associated with\r\nthe wind turbines is expected to escalate with the increase in installation rate\r\ncorrespondingly. Therefore, searching for solutions for the current challenges in wind\r\nenergy electricity production is essential. In wind turbines, the majority of failures are\r\ndue to wind turbine gearbox (WTG) breakdowns. Despite advanced design practices,\r\ngearbox failures are found in critical bearing locations. The premature bearing failures\r\nassociated with WTG bearings and the drive train components reduce the life span of\r\nthe wind turbine and increase the cost per unit of energy. A prevalent trigger for these\r\npremature bearing failures in the WTG is the presence of white etching areas (WEAs)\r\nand white etching cracks (WECs). The formation of WEAs and WECs further leads to\r\nwhite structure flaking (WSF) and axial cracking bearing components. This mode of\r\naggressive failure lessens the lifetime of WTG to less than two years from the designed\r\nlife expectancy of 20 -25 years. The WECs failure is predominantly formed due to the\r\ntransient operating environment of WTG bearings at the surface and subsurface\r\nheterogeneities of the bearing steel. Extensive root cause assessment of failed bearings\r\nidentified two predominant driving forces: 1) Mechanical stress-induced and 2)\r\nHydrogen-enhanced premature bearing failure. For the past several decades,\r\nresearchers, design engineers, and lubrication engineers have collectively worked\r\ntowards enhancing the performance of WTGs, reducing downtime, and overall bringing down the unit price of energy as much as possible. However, the attempts did not result\r\nin a significant improvement in the WTG-bearing life.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to mitigate the formation of WEAs in the bearing steel using\r\nalternative material, suitable surface coating and base oil selection. AISI 52100 is one\r\nof the most commonly used bearing steels in the wind turbine industry for the\r\nproduction of rolling element bearings. The WEAs replication tests were carried out in\r\na dynamic load Pin-on-Disc (PoD) tribometer, which can provide severe cyclic\r\ncompressive stress and pure slide throughout the operation. The dynamic PoD is\r\ndesigned to accelerate WEAs formation in the bearing ball subsurface. The loading\r\nfrequency is fixed at 4.5 Hz for the WEAs replication tests discussed in this thesis. This\r\nresearch evaluated the feasibility of AISI 440C stainless steel as an alternative bearing\r\nmaterial against WEAs formation using polyalphaolefin (PAO) base stock oil. The\r\ncomprehensive analysis of materials and lubricants revealed that the performance of\r\nAISI 440C stainless steel increased WEAs formation time to 0.42 million cycles from\r\n0.21 million loading cycles of AISI 52100 bearing steel. Further, this work investigated\r\nthe performance of mineral oil (heavy paraffin oil) and synthetic poly alkyl glycol\r\n(PAG) against the WEAs formation under pure sliding with cyclic compressive loading.\r\nThe performance of lubricants was evaluated using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)\r\nand electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The outcomes reveal that the free\r\nradical formation rate is higher for paraffin than PAG. The WEAs formation in the\r\nbearing steel is delayed in the PAG-tested samples compared to paraffin oil. However,\r\nat higher contact pressures, the use of PAG does not significantly improve WEA\r\nformation time compared to the reference oil (PAO). Therefore, the mitigation strategies were extended to the surface modification methods, such as DLC-based\r\ncoating, to delay the formation of WEAs in the bearing subsurface.\r\n\r\nThe performance of hydrogenated diamond-like-carbon (DLC) coating against WEAs\r\nformation was evaluated under sliding-dynamic conditions. The bearing ball samples\r\nwere first coated with Cr/CrN and W interlayer using the physical vapour deposition\r\n(PVD) technique. Subsequently, hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) DLC using\r\nthe plasma-assisted chemical vapour deposition (PACVD) method. The dynamic\r\nloading experiments were carried out in the dynamic load PoD tribometer with PAO\r\nunder a boundary lubrication regime. Prior to the dynamic load tests, detailed surface\r\nand tribological characterisation of the deposited DLC coating was carried out. The\r\npost-WEAs replication test analysis results were compared with the uncoated AISI\r\n52100 bearing steel tribopair to evaluate the performance of DLC-coated bearing steel\r\nagainst WEAs formation under given conditions. The results obtained show the\r\ncapability of the proposed coating to delay the formation of WEAs in the bearing steel\r\nthan that of the uncoated sample. The WEAs inception was observed in the uncoated\r\nAISI 52100 bearing samples after 0.21 million cycles, whereas WEAs were observed\r\nin the DLC-coated bearing ball samples after 1 million loading cycles. The DLC coating\r\non the bearing steel surface retards the WEAs formation in three ways. (i) The wear\r\nrate of the coated sample is minimised because of the superior wear resistance\r\ncharacteristic, which reduces the lubricant degradation and hydrogen ingression. (ii)\r\nThe inbuilt hydrogen barrier properties of DLC coating suppress the amount of atomic\r\nhydrogen that enters the bearing steel subsurface. (iii) The coating reduces the\r\ninterfacial friction and thus reduces the accumulation of slip energy. Further, this study\r\nassessed the performance of base oils with various lubricant chemistry against microstructural decay in DLC-coated AISI 52100 bearing steel. Mineral, polyethylene\r\nglycol (PEG) and PAO oils were chosen for the study. The effect of base oils against\r\nWEAs formation in DLC-coated steel is explored by analysing the condition of oils,\r\nwear behaviour, and subsurface microstructural change. The wear rate, free radical\r\ngeneration, and water concentration were highest for the PEG samples. Besides that,\r\ncarbon film formation on the contact surfaces was delayed in the PEG-tested samples\r\ncompared to the mineral oil-tested samples. The findings from the wear and lubricant\r\nanalyses explain the accelerated formation of WEAs in PEG-tested samples under the\r\ngiven test conditions. WEAs formation propensity is higher for PEG-tested samples\r\ncompared to mineral oil. In contrast, WEAs formation is not observed in PAO-tested\r\nsamples under given test conditions.\r\n\r\nThus, with proper surface coating and base oil selection, the WEAs inception time in\r\nbearing steel can be significantly increased. Overall, under realistic conditions, it would\r\nreduce the failure rate of WTG bearings while also lowering the cost per unit of energy\r\nand helping in wind energy market expansion.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','Keywords: Diamond-like carbon coating, dynamic loading, hydrogen ingression, lubricant degradation, ','','',1,'2024-06-24 15:25:06','Active'),(657,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Demystifying the arterial pulse wave: a system and method to quantify pulse wave reflections and its novel applications','Mr. Rahul M (EE17D202) ','Ph.D scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide:Dr. Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam  \r\nCo-Guide:Dr. Jayaraj Joseph\r\n\r\n','Electrical Engineering','2024/06/28 15:00','2024-06-28','yes','Online (Googlemeet)','Early detection and timely intervention are critical for reducing mortality, minimising disease burden, and enhancing outcomes in cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Traditional risk factors fall short in detecting subclinical CVD, whereas early vascular ageing (EVA) markers derived from arterial pulse waves detect the early manifestations of CVD. The arterial pulse wave, a signature of vascular health, is moulded by pulse wave reflections (PWR) in the arterial system. Quantification of PWR elucidates physiologic mechanisms of EVA and is pivotal for reliable assessment of local pulse wave velocity (PWV) â€“ an emerging EVA marker. Current methods to quantify PWR using wave separation analysis (WSA) require simultaneous pressure (P) and flow (Q) from the aorta, posing challenges due to the need for non-invasive techniques and complex instrumentation. This PhD work addresses these challenges by proposing bio-physics models and instrumentation for quantifying PWR using a single pulse wave and its novel applications in improving the reliability of measuring the local PWV. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe arterial pulse wave was decomposed using a Multi-Gaussian Decomposition Model (MGDM) of a pulse waveform with weighted and shifted Gaussians for WSA. The wave separation was obtained using empirically derived relationships and ground-truth parametric analysis. In the second approach, Q was constructed as a Multi-Rayleigh Flow Model using weighted and shifted Rayleigh functions. The model parameters were derived from P and analysed in frequency domain for WSA. \r\n\r\nThe performance of these methods was validated on in-silico virtual subjects database (N = 4374, healthy, age: 25 â€“ 75 years) and in-vivo studies on human participants (N = 70, healthy, age: 20 â€“ 51 years). Reliable forward and backward pulse waves were obtained using both approaches, with root-mean-square error of 2.5 mmHg. The reflection quantification indices obtained from both methods had a statistically significant and strong correlation (r > 0.75, p < 0.001) with those obtained using reference methods. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nControlled experiments and evidence from literature, suggests that PWR corrupts the pulse morphology in the systolic phase, affecting the reliability of measuring local PWV. The WSA based on the proposed methods was used to improve the reliability and repeatability of measuring local PWV at the common carotid artery. A measurement apparatus consisting of a dual-channel ultrasound transducer with an integrated pressure sensor was developed to measure PWV. Results from in-vivo invasive studies on animals (N = 2, male porcine) and non-invasive studies on human participants (N = 60, healthy, age: 20 â€“ 56 years) indicate a lower coefficient of variation (~7% (from ~8%) at diastole, and ~10% (from ~30%) at systole) in the beat-to-beat estimates of PWV after eliminating PWR. Additionally, the mean values obtained from reflection-free PWV and from theoretical estimates of PWV were statistically assessed, and the results indicated no significant difference between the means (p > 0.05) at both diastole and systole. In comparison, the PWV (with reflections) revealed a statistically significant difference between the means (p < 0.05). The method and system proposed in this thesis would potentially strengthen the on-going global efforts of achieving reliable measurements of EVA markers for CVD risk stratifications.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/sjb-kndt-zxb','','',1,'2024-06-25 03:21:22','Active'),(658,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL',' Robot-Assisted Virtual Reality Platform for Antenatal Ultrasound Scanning','Mr. Shyam (EE20S065)','MS Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Mohanasankar S\r\n\r\n\r\n','Electrical Engineering','2024/06/27 09:30','2024-06-27','yes','Online (Googlemeet)','Maternal healthcare poses significant challenges in developing and underdeveloped countries due to insufficient access to basic antenatal ultrasound (US) examinations, limited healthcare resources, and a shortage of skilled professionals. Geographical inaccessibility further hinders access to essential antenatal care services in rural areas, increasing the risks and financial burdens associated with traveling to distant scan centres. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo address these challenges and improve maternal care, robotic antenatal ultrasound systems with either tele-operable or autonomous capabilities were proposed. However, existing teleoperation methods rely on conventional video stream-based approaches, limiting immersion and scene awareness. Moreover, autonomous antenatal robotic ultrasound systems that automate standardized scanning protocols are unavailable. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis work introduces a novel Robot-Assisted Virtual Reality (VR) platform to perform teleoperated and autonomous robotic manipulations for enhanced antenatal ultrasound scanning. The platform allows sonologists to control a robotic arm over a wired network and displays a reconstructed 3D view of the environment for an immersive user experience. This facilitates enhanced visualizations during the scan through the use of 3D models, such as reconstructed patientâ€™s surface anatomy, virtual robot, and clinical setup. Additionally, the platform also supports autonomous operations, enabling the robot to execute the standard six-step approach recommended by the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (ISUOG) for obstetric ultrasound scanning under the supervision of the sonologist. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe proposed system was validated using a 23-week fetal phantom. Six sonologists experimented with the system, rating an average score of 4.8 out of 5 for its ease of use. The system achieved a 3D surface reconstruction of the fetal phantom with a positional error of less than 2 mm. Users operated the system in teleoperation mode, averaged 15 minutes per session, and observed seamless robot manoeuvring with no adverse events. The robotic system successfully performed the complete ISUOG six-step approach in under 9 minutes, covering a Cartesian path length of 2310.8 mm on the fetal phantom. Both qualitative and quantitative performance assessments, along with positive feedback from experts, support the systemâ€™s feasibility and provide insights for further refinements towards clinical viability.

Stereo depth estimation relies on stereo matching, where depth is inferred by matching corresponding pixels in stereo image pairs to calculate disparity. Key to stereo matching is the cost volume, representing dissimilarity between pixel pairs, which poses computational challenges. We propose two convolutional neural network-based architectures, SDE-DualENet and 2T-UNet, which circumvent the cost volume construction step and preset maximum disparity parameter dependencies in stereo depth estimation. While the former method eliminates the need for cost-volume, the latter additionally integrates monocular depth information to improve scene geometry prediction, achieving better performance on challenging datasets.\r\n\r\nWe also address the limitations faced by stereo depth estimation techniques in capturing the intricacies of scenes in high dynamic range imaging. The recent trend in industries and research communities seek to merge 3D and HDR technologies for immersive viewing experiences. Creating cost-effective 3D HDR content requires accurate depth estimation, which is challenging due to SDR cameras\' limited sensitivity and complex natural scenes. We address this by proposing a dual-encoder single-decoder convolutional neural network, which excels in learning the disparity while efficiently merging disparity maps obtained from stereo images at varying exposure levels developing an efficient multi-exposure stereo depth estimation framework. \r\n\r\nFinally, we address the limitations of supervised low-light image enhancement methods, which require paired datasets of low and normal light images that are difficult to capture in real-world conditions. We present ELEGAN, a lightweight generative adversarial network which employs self-regularized illumination attention mapping and modified residual dense blocks to restore low-light images, reducing noise and enhancing visual quality in real-world scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our proposed methods through qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis with state-of-the-art techniques.\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','MS Seminar cum TSA Meeting of Mr. Rohit Choudhary (EE20S002) -web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.','','',1,'2024-06-25 04:08:51','Active'),(660,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Mechanical response of automotive thin sheet steels and components at high strain rate multiaxial loading','Mr. Pundan Kumar Singh (AM21D043)','Ph.

However, stringent regulations and intense competition in the market make it challenging to increase earnings solely from regular airfare. Consequently, airlines are compelled to rethink their strategies and explore new sources of revenue by unbundling ancillary services from the core airfare. This shift, from initially free ancillary services to chargeable ones, can sometimes lead to passenger dissatisfaction. To mitigate this and rebuild trust, transparent ancillary pricing, and effective policymaking become essential, particularly in service-oriented industries like aviation. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first part of the study, we consider the model for a cost-based approach to bring transparency and fairness in baggage ancillary pricing. We employ the concept of efficient cost allocation, drawing from cooperative game theory\'s Aumann-Shapley (A-S) value, to determine prices for both baggage weight and volume. The concept of A-S value originates from the measure theory where a non-atomic measure is used to allocate the value of the game when the game consists of infinite players. Our methodology extends the traditional A-S value by incorporating chargeable capacity and offering passengers baggage allowances based on weight and volume. Additionally, we develop asymmetric pricing models for different booking periods using a weighted A-S value. Our approach bridges the gap between the traditional Ramsey-Boiteux asymmetric pricing rule and the weighted A-S value. The analysis of a joint-cost function for baggage transport demonstrates that our approach generates higher revenue compared to the existing weight-based pricing system.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research subsequently explores the complexities involved in crafting baggage allowance policy, shedding light on how baggage services impact airline profitability.  We construct a mathematical model that incorporates baggage allowance\'s impact on passenger and baggage demand. By employing first-order stochastic dominance, we model the stimulating effect of baggage allowance on baggage demand and compute allowance for a pooled demand case. Our findings indicate that the determination of baggage allowance is also influenced by ticket prices, with higher airfares for business class tickets correlating to more generous baggage allowances. In competitive market scenarios, our extended model addresses the joint optimization of airfare and baggage allowance decisions. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe air travel industry accommodates a diverse range of passengers, each with distinct needs and priorities. Leisure travelers, for instance, have preferences distinct from the budget-focused priorities of business travelers, while corporate passengers prioritize service quality and efficiency. Recognizing this diversity, the introduction of itinerary recommendation services emerges as a pivotal factor, significantly reducing search time for corporate travelers and elevating their overall travel experience. The final segment of the research captures this idea. We use the real booking data obtained from Sabre Corporation, a global travel solution provider, to apply advanced machine learning algorithms. The model is tested on the augmented data to compute the choice probability for an itinerary. We explain the features by calculating the relative importance of each feature contributing to the decision-making process. Further, the choice probability is used to rank the itineraries for the Origin-Destination (OD) pair, which can be used as a product for the airline\'s corporate booking platforms. \r\n ','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-25 06:12:54','Active'),(664,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','\"The Multi-player Brown-von Neumann-Nash dynamics on Measurable Spaces: Well-posedness and Stability\"','Mr. Karl Darryl Lewis, MA18D202','Research Scholar, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','DC Members: Dr. C.

Specifically, the emphasis is on assessing the influence of three facets of internal governance on firm performance, i.e., ownership structure, board composition, and leadership structure (CEO duality). These facets of governance are crucial factors leading to variations in corporate governance practices among firms.\r\nOwnership structure reflects the shareholding pattern among founders/promoters, significant shareholders , and non-promoters.  The ownership pattern  is considered crucial for a firmâ€™s internal governance. Globally, the shareholding pattern of listed entities in recent years has undergone significant changes, leading to a shift towards concentrated ownership structures. Excess ownership concentration can lead to agency problems between controlling and minority owners, adversely influencing the firmâ€™s performance. This research investigates the relationship between ownership structure and performance, focusing on a range of ownership categories, such as individuals, institutions, corporations, government, and others, as well as domestic and foreign owners.\r\nSimilarly, board composition and leadership structure represent the firmâ€™s internal governance mechanism for alleviating agency conflict. The advisory and monitoring role of the board steers the firmâ€™s strategic direction and influences the firmâ€™s performance. This study focuses on two dimensions of board composition from the perspective of firm performance, viz., board size and board independence. \r\nBoard size is an essential attribute for determining the level of governance, considering its role in strategic guidance and monitoring. The need to optimize the board size arises, as a lower-than-optimum board size may overburden the directors, reducing their monitoring efficiency. On the contrary, too large a board size may lead to a lack of coordination and delays in decision-making. Thus, a departure from optimum board size can adversely impact performance. Similarly, a smaller proportion of independent directors may lead to ineffective oversight and control of the executiveâ€™s self-serving behavior.  On the contrary, a higher number can lead to delays in the implementation of strategies. Thus, if firms deviate from the optimal proportion of independent directors, it may result in a detrimental effect on performance. \r\nFurther, considering the firmâ€™s leadership structure as an essential pillar to uphold good governance practices, the effect of CEO duality on firm performance is also examined. It is crucial for a firm to ensure segregation of roles between the Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director (CEO/MD) and Chairman in order to derive performance advantages. The separation of leadership roles aids in preventing issues such as entrenchment, which can worsen agency conflicts and adversely influence firmâ€™s performance. \r\nThe findings of the study indicate that ownership structure, board composition, and leadership structure (CEO Duality) are crucial internal governance mechanisms influencing firmâ€™s financial performance. In addition, increase in shareholding by specific categories of owners are found to moderate the relationship between board composition (board size and board independence) and firm performance, as well as CEO duality and firm performance.\r\nThe results of the study are expected to be beneficial to analysts, policymakers, and researchers. For an analyst, it is crucial to identify the factors that determine the performance of firms. Further, understanding the implications of internal governance mechanisms is of interest to policymakers to assess the firmâ€™s governance quality and formulate the code for best practices. Similarly, researchers can draw insights from the interplay between ownership structure, board structure, and performance and extend the research in future.  \r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-25 07:06:06','Active'),(666,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Criticality and universality in strongly interacting many-body liquids','Dr. T.M.

Of particular interest and appeal are the universality and the critical exponents that govern phase transitions of seemingly disparate phenomena. The inclusion of strongly interacting physics into the picture makes it more novel and vibrant. Two-dimensional electrons under a strong perpendicular magnetic field leads to an array of highly correlated many-body states, the fractional quantum Hall state (FQHS) being one of the most exciting and intriguing among them. Extensive studies of disorder-induced localization have led to the emergence of a universal scaling picture in the case of non-interacting integer quantum Hall states (IQHS). However, a comprehensive study in the strongly interacting FQHS regime is scarce. Here, we report scaling measurements in the FQHS regime where interaction plays a dominant role. This study is motivated by recent calculations, based on the composite fermion theory, that suggest identical critical exponents in both IQHS and FQHS cases to the extent that the interaction between composite fermions is negligible. Finally, I will also briefly touch upon some new results that shed light on the effect of interactions and the resulting critical exponents in the IQHS regime.\r\n\r\n','Prof. Manu Jaiswal','manu.jaiswal@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-25 09:05:38','Active'),(667,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Pickering emulsion-templated acrylate-based porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering','Mr. Aadinath (BT16D037)','Ph.D. Research Scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Prof. Vignesh Muthu Vijayan, BT','Department of Biotechnology','2024/06/28 17:00','2024-06-28','','Google Meet â€“ meet.google.com/eun-jogg-quf','Cancellous bone is a highly porous structure (75-90%) that forms the interior portion of the bone. The mechanical strength of the cancellous bone is in the range of 4-20 MPa, which is significantly high compared to the other body parts except cortical bone. Hence, while fabricating a scaffold for cancellous bone, balancing porosity and mechanical strength is a major challenge. Inducing angiogenesis and preventing microbial infection during bone injury are other aspects that must be considered while designing the scaffolds.\r\nBased on the literature work, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)-based Pickering emulsion polymerization of acrylate monomers might be the promising material to address the above-mentioned challenges. In our study, different weights of oleic acid (OA) were loaded onto the IONPs to introduce hydrophobicity and further characterized using various techniques. These differently oleic acid-loaded IONPs were tested for suitability as a Pickering emulsifier, while acrylate monomers were dissolved in the organic phase. After successfully preparing the Pickering emulsions, polymerization of acrylate monomers was carried out using AIBN, which yielded porous materials. Post polymerization, porous scaffold materials were characterized for physicochemical and biological properties. These porous scaffold materials were tested for their antibacterial activity against osteomyelitis-causative S. aureus species. The pro-angiogenic potential of the scaffolds was evaluated using in ovo CAM assay. The optimized scaffold material was taken further to check the osteogenic potential. In our study, we have tested the osteogenic potential of nutraceutical, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). As PUFAs are highly unstable bioactive compounds, we have encapsulated them in the liposome system and loaded them onto the scaffolds.

Given the intermittent nature of sustainable energy sources, a global phase-out of greenhouse gas-intensive energy sources will require efficient storage and conversion of sustainable energy. In particular, interest is growing in the interconversion of dinitrogen (N2) and ammonia (NH3), given the high energy density of NH3 (~6.25 kWh kg-1). Apart from being a critical fertilizer component, NH3 is also an ideal hydrogen carrier (17.7 wt%, 40% higher than methanol), and can be readily transported and stored using existing infrastructures and then directly utilized for energy applications such as a direct ammonia fuel cell (DAFC). However, today most NH3 is synthesized via the century-old Haber-Bosch process, which operates at extreme temperature (723-823K) and pressure (250-350 atm). It is estimated that NH3 synthesis consumes about 1% of the worldâ€™s electricity and a significant fraction of the worldâ€™s natural gas for hydrogen production via steam reforming of methane. Electrochemical synthesis of NH3 from N2 at near-ambient conditions would allow a drastically reduced carbon footprint while simultaneously enabling carbon-free energy storage. The electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (N2RR) is unfortunately hindered by competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); as a result, despite years of efforts and significant capability and knowledge advances, state-of-the-art N2RR catalysts yield NH3 on the order of Î¼A cm-2, orders of magnitude lower than the DOE REFUEL target of 300 mA cm-2. This talk will address the critical need to identify possible alternative routes towards interconversion of N2 and NH3. In the absence of such a capability, a transition to a sustainable energy portfolio will face serious challenges.\r\n','Chemical Engineering office','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-25 10:20:28','Active'),(669,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL',' Generalized Sparse Regression Codes for Short Block Lengths ','Mr. Madhusudan Kumar Sinha (EE16D028) ','Ph.D scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Arun Pachai Kannu ','Electrical Engineering','2024/07/02 15:00','2024-07-02','yes','Online (Googlemeet)','Sparse Regression Codes (SPARC) are a class of error control codes that use sparse linear combinations of columns of a dictionary matrix as codewords. SPARC combines the sparse signal recovery framework of compressive sensing with error control coding techniques.

We focus on improving the performance of SPARC for short block lengths by introducing low-correlation dictionary matrices, efficient encoders, and efficient decoders. The dictionary matrices are based on Gold code sequences and mutually unbiased bases. We introduce two generalizations of the SPARC to maximize the number of bits for a given sparsity level and dictionary size. We also introduce a computationally efficient greedy decoder called match and decode (MAD) decoder and its parallel computing counterpart called parallel MAD decoder. We numerically show that generalized SPARC with PMAD performs well in short block-length regimes with error performance comparable to existing error control codes of the same length. We also observe that PMAD outperforms the AMP decoder and its variants in short block length regime. We numerically show that the resulting code outperforms the lower bound for orthogonal multiple access codes in the short block length regime when used for multi-user communication.

The FH network connects\r\nthe O-RAN Distributed Unit (O-DU) to one or more O-RAN Radio Units (O-RU). In Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) Massive Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output\r\n(MIMO) systems, the FH load increases in proportion to the number of antennas during the transmission of Channel State Information - Reference Signal (CSI-RS) for downlink channel sounding. However, the O-RAN functional split scales the FH capacity with the number of MIMO layers.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present a new intra-PHY functional split (7-2x+) for CSI-RS alternative to the existing O-RANâ€™s 7-2x split. The proposed split distributes the signal processing functions for CSI-RS transmission into two stages. The first stage (CSI-RS base sequence mapping) is implemented in the O-DU, and the second stage (superimposing orthogonal weights) is implemented in the O-RU. Our results indicate that the proposed split significantly reduces the Fronthaul CSI-RS transportation load while enabling much simpler processing at O-DU and O-RU compared to the existing O-RAN split. Also, the proposed split can be implemented in any centralized RAN architecture and does not require any change in the existing 5G NR standards.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we propose a computationally efficient solution to implement Least Squares (LS) channel estimation using CSI-RS on the User Equipment (UE) side.

Using a model of the DCF/EDCA mechanism, the long-term average throughput of a saturated Wi-Fi link is characterized in terms of finer performance measures, including channel access delay, transmission opportunities, collision and retransmission rates, and configuration settings, including average PHY rate and AMPDU aggregation levels. By analyzing the wireless packet capture, the evolution of the Wi-Fi radio through the transmission opportunities, idle/backoff durations and channel busy states is investigated. This pcap analysis permits studying idle time in the channel, quantifying non-Wi-Fi energy in the channel, detecting instances of unfair channel access and identifying hidden/parallel transmissions. These findings provide valuable insights into explaining the measured link metrics and throughput. The utility and effectiveness of this proposal are illustrated by reviewing Wi-Fi link performance in a variety of test network scenarios.

In such moments of change, firms employ agile practices for production, marketing, and techn ology. However, they seldom focus on understanding or enhancing workforce agility at the individual level. While most literature revolves around \'systemic factors\' influencing employee agility, our work addresses the gap in understanding the \'individual factors\' influencing agility and the dearth of \'evidence-based training practice\' to promote it. Through this research, we sought to understand the individual-level motivational, cognitive, and emotional antecedents to workers\' agility. Through a narrative literature review, we published a conceptual model that proposed that I-type curiosity would enhance Reflective Pondering. Such pondering can build agile capacities when moderated by dispositional Joy. By contrast, D-type curiosity would attenuate Brooding, debilitating agile behaviors. In addition, we designed \'Intermodal Arts-Based Intervention\' (IABI) to enhance I-type and decrease D-type curiosity, subsequently strengthening agility.\r\nWe then performed five consecutive studies to a.Validate the conceptual model and b.Expand our understanding of the attributes and effects of IABI at the workplace. Study 1 was a cross-sectional survey to validate the proposed model, Study 2 was a quasi-experimental study to evaluate the intervention\'s effectiveness, Study 3 is a case study to understand the phases through which the learning progressed during the intervention, Study 4 was a Diary study to understand the workplace outcomes, and facilitators and barriers to implementation of learnings at the workplace, and Study 5 was a focus group discussion (FGD) to analyze the longitudinal outcomes (6 months) of the intervention on employees\' personality factors. The findings revealed that Deprivation-type curiosity predicted both types of rumination; however, only the Brooding type negatively predicted agility. Interest-type curiosity buffered the effect of Brooding, thereby increasing agility, and Joy moderated this relationship. Experimental results showed that IABI enhanced Interest-type curiosity and agility but did not significantly reduce D-type-curiosity.\r\nFurthermore, we noted IABI\'s role in promoting momentum and socio-cognitive mindfulness among employees, accentuating their resilience and thriving. Several long-term changes were also reported in employees\' personality factors: affect, behavior, and cognition. Additionally, the results from case studies show that enhancing employees\' perception of their strengths, emotional regulation, and self-control demands and instilling a solution-focused approach are crucial in determining the effectiveness of arts-based employee development initiatives. This paper advocates the need for exploratory work culture and strength-based performance improvement mechanisms and condemns deficit-focused employee development initiatives. \r\n\r\nKeywords: Workforce agility, Epistemic curiosity, Rumination, Joy, Arts-intervention ','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-26 03:32:37','Active'),(673,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€˜â€™TIME SERIES FORECASTING USING MACHINE LEARNING AND OPERATIONS RESEARCHâ€™â€™.','Mr. S.

Benchmarking against established models such as Holt-Winters, ARIMA, and Neural Networks shows that this approach produces accurate long- and medium-term forecasts for short-time series. The research then delves into the realm of forecast combination and pooling as a means to combat model uncertainties.

However, the interference between data mapped to the Last Level Cache (LLC) from different cores can be detrimental. This interference often results in premature eviction and thrashing, leading to reduced system throughput. Performance can be significantly enhanced by maintaining the working set of applications that can fit within the cache, while also allocating cache space for parts of the working set from remaining applications.\r\n\r\nWe introduce a novel, application-aware, coarse-grained cache replacement policy named Address Translation Aware Re-reference Interval Prediction (ATARRIP). This policy incorporates a newly defined metric, High Reuse Distance (HRD) pages, calculated during the address translation phase. We employ the HRD pages metric to predict application behavior, thereby refining our cache replacement decisions. Our empirical findings indicate that ATARRIP surpasses the previously established state-of-the-art coarse-grained policy for multi-core systems, TADRRIP, in multi-core systems both with and without prefetchers. Additionally, ATARRIP achieves performance comparable to some fine-grained policies such as SHIP, and is only marginally outperformed by others like Hawkeye. ATARRIP managed shared cache achieves significant improvements over SRRIP on both 4-core and 8-core systems, with approximately half the storage overhead compared to the traditional LRU policy for a 16-way set associative LLC.','Hema G, Mechanical Engg','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-26 04:17:06','Active'),(675,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Pickering emulsion-templated acrylate-based porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering','Mr. Aadinath (BT16D037)','Ph.D. Research Scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Prof. Vignesh Muthu Vijayan, BT','Department of Biotechnology','2024/06/28 15:00','2024-06-28','','Google Meet â€“ meet.google.com/eun-jogg-quf','Cancellous bone is a highly porous structure (75-90%) that forms the interior portion of the bone. The mechanical strength of the cancellous bone is in the range of 4-20 MPa, which is significantly high compared to the other body parts except cortical bone. Hence, while fabricating a scaffold for cancellous bone, balancing porosity and mechanical strength is a major challenge. Inducing angiogenesis and preventing microbial infection during bone injury are other aspects that must be considered while designing the scaffolds.\r\nBased on the literature work, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs)-based Pickering emulsion polymerization of acrylate monomers might be the promising material to address the above-mentioned challenges. In our study, different weights of oleic acid (OA) were loaded onto the IONPs to introduce hydrophobicity and further characterized using various techniques. These differently oleic acid-loaded IONPs were tested for suitability as a Pickering emulsifier, while acrylate monomers were dissolved in the organic phase. After successfully preparing the Pickering emulsions, polymerization of acrylate monomers was carried out using AIBN, which yielded porous materials. Post polymerization, porous scaffold materials were characterized for physicochemical and biological properties. These porous scaffold materials were tested for their antibacterial activity against osteomyelitis-causative S. aureus species. The pro-angiogenic potential of the scaffolds was evaluated using in ovo CAM assay. The optimized scaffold material was taken further to check the osteogenic potential. In our study, we have tested the osteogenic potential of nutraceutical, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). As PUFAs are highly unstable bioactive compounds, we have encapsulated them in the liposome system and loaded them onto the scaffolds. The osteogenic potential of the scaffold loaded with PUFAs was investigated by alizarin red assay, ALP activity, and RT-PCR studies.\r\n','BT OFFICE','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','Publications: 1.

Decoherence of the qubits, whilst interacting with the environment, collapses them, making them lose their quantum properties. Hence, the qubits require fault tolerance schemes to control the consequences of decoherence. The current quantum computers belong to the NISQ era, meaning the number of qubits accessible for error reduction techniques is restricted to a few hundred qubits. This makes it essential to devise error correction schemes on the limited number of qubits and prevent decoherence to obtain an error-free computation from the quantum computer.\r\nQuantum converse thresholds define the probability of error/noise in quantum computers above which an accurate computation can never be performed using the quantum computer, no matter how much the redundancy is increased. These converse bounds also translate to a lower bound on the redundancy needed for an accurate quantum computation. We focus on obtaining such converse bounds for quantum computations. We obtain a lower bound on the redundancy essential for ðœ–-accurate implementation of a large class of operations, including unitary operators. We also derive the converse bounds for the particular case of quantum computation using classical inputs and outputs. Then, we derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the minimum required redundancy required for the same.\r\nFurther, physical resource constraints in quantum circuits escalate noise levels when increasing redundancy, thus making numerous fault-tolerance schemes useless. So, we characterise the effect of resource constraints and derive the lower bound on redundancy for quantum circuits with classical inputs and outputs under resource-constrained noise.\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/yrq-mxwi-hrq','','',1,'2024-06-26 06:07:56','Active'),(681,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€œCONTINUOUS IN-VITRO MONITORING OF GLUCOSE & PH IN 3D CO-CULTURED TUMOUR SPHEROIDS USING SERS BASED GLUCOSE AND PH NANOSENSORSâ€.','Ms. Koyel Dey  (ED17D302)','Ph.D. Scholar ','Dr. Shankar Ram C S   (Chair)\r\n\r\nDr. Ki-Taek Lim\r\nKangwon National University\r\nSouth Korea\r\n\r\nDr. Tuhin Subhra Santra (Guide)â€‹\r\n\r\nDr. Saumendra Kumar Bajpai, AM  (Co- Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Fan Gang Tseng (Co- Guide)','Engineering Design Department','2024/06/27 15:00','2024-06-27','yes','Google Meet joining info Video call link: https://meet.google.com/dzj-sjio-rse','The persistent increase in cancer rates and its fatalities have pushed the biomedical research towards the development of 3D multicellular spheroid that can effectively replicate tumor microenvironment and probe the intratumor parameters. In the tumor microenvironment, cancer cells, activates several signaling pathways, that contributes towards distinct tumor-associated phenomena such as hypoxic core, extracellular matrix, secretome changes, reduced glucose concentration and enhanced acidic pH on the extracellular surface. Acidity in tumor microenvironment is often associated with glucose consumption rates. Tumor cells normally increases their acid production owing to their increased metabolism rate; however, they still maintain a normal or alkaline intracellular pH. The major acid load is typically transported outside the cells, that cannot be efficiently eliminated by the vasculature. Due to the limited capacity of the primary extracellular buffer, the extracellular space tends to become acidic. Thus, non-invasive monitoring of glucose and pH variations in the tumor microenvironment, during tumor growth has becomes extremely important for understanding cancer mechanisms.\r\n \r\n\r\nIn this thesis, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based glucose and pH nanosensors are developed and applied for non-invasive, real-time measurement of different physiological parameters in the intratumor region of various co-cultured spheroids. The 3D multicellular co-cultured spheroids were produced using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based Âµ-well array chip. The diameter of each well in the Âµ-well array chip is 500 Âµm and it can accommodate simultaneous culture of 600 spheroids. The SERS based glucose nanosensor (SERS-gNPS) was fabricated by conjugating 4-Mercaptophenylboronic acid (4-MPBA) to 50 nm silver nanoparticles (AgNP) and used under confocal Raman spectroscopy to measure glucose. The calibration curve shows direct relationship between Raman peak intensity at 1078 cm-1 with increasing glucose levels. The sensor has a limit of detection of 0.1mM and found to be linear in the physiological range (1 mM â€“ 10 mM) of glucose with the average standard deviation of Â±5%. The glucose nanosensor also showed a good selectivity against different metallic and non-metallic ions (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, HCO3-, H2O2), good reproducibility, thermal stability and high biocompatibility. The glucose nanosensor was embedded in the 3D co-cultured colon cancer spheroid (colon cancer cell (HCT8) and fibroblast (NIH3T3)) and 3D mono fibroblast (NIH3T3) mono cultured spheroid for non-invasive real time measurement of glucose in the intratumor microenvironment. The confocal Raman spectroscopy analysis indicated that 3D colon cancer based co-cultured tumor spheroids were observed to have a more prominent glucose gradient (~1mM) as compared to 3D fibroblast mono cultured tumor spheroid (~0.4mM), from core to peripheral regions at 3 days to 5 days of culture.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe pH nanosensors (SERS-pNPS) were fabricated by conjugating 4-Mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) to 50 nm silver nanoparticles (AgNP) and used under confocal Raman spectroscopy to measure pH. The calibration curve shows a linear relationship between ratio metric Raman peak intensity (1378 cm-1 / 1620 cm-1) with increase in pH level. The sensor has a limit of detection of pH 4.4 and found to be linear within the physiological range of pH (4.4 â€“ 8.23). The pH nanosensors were applied for non-invasive pH measurements in different 3D co-cultured spheroid models such as A549-NIH3T3 (lung cancer), MCF-NIH3T3 (breast cancer), HCT8-NIH3T3 (colon cancer) and NIH3T3 (fibroblast) based mono-cultured spheroid (3D-MS).  The cellular arrangement in the co-cultured spheroid were also analyzed using fluorescence based confocal imaging. The two types of cells were observed to self-organize into core-shell chimeric tumor spheroids (CTS) with fibroblasts confined to the shell and cancer cells localized to the core. The confocal Raman spectroscopy analysis revealed that the 3D co-cultured cancerous tumour models have 16% more acidic microenvironment as compared to 3D mono cultured spheroid model. Also, a presence of a decreasing pH gradient from peripheral to the core region is observed in both the cases indicating acidosis in the core region.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn brief, these findings offer a brief analysis of glucose and pH level in different 3D multicellular tumor. Glucose and pH nanosensor exhibited linear response in the physiological range of glucose and pH and they could be effectively incorporated in the 3D tumor model for real time non-invasive measurement. In addition, SERS-gNPS and SERS-pNPS provides a platform for accurate and real-time measurement of glucose and pH, thus offers an enhanced understanding cancer mechanisms in various 3D tumor spheroid model.','edoffice@iitm.ac.in','edoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-26 06:30:35','Active'),(682,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Numerical and experimental analysis of powder bed homogeneity by multi-layer spreading in additive manufacturing','Mr. Jaggannagari Sujith Reddy, ME18D011','Ph.D. Scholar, Machine Design Section, Department of Mechanical Engineering','Guide: Prof. Ratna Kumar Annabattula / Co-Guide: Prof. Yixiang Gan (The University of Sydney, Australia).\r\nDC members: 1.

In this work, powder bed homogeneity is analysed using experiments and discrete element method (DEM) simulations. The experimental investigations revealed variation in the particle size distributions in the extreme zones of the spreading platform, indicating segregation within the powder bed. Several previous studies have numerically examined the segregation of powders during the spreading process. However, these works were limited to single-layer spreading simulations. In the present work, scaled DEM simulations were carried out to analyse the multi-layer spreading process. The results showed that the packing density of the spread layer initially increases during the spreading process and then reaches a constant value of approximately 56%, which is in good agreement with the experimental findings. The simulation results also revealed the variation in the packing density and particle size distribution in different zones of the spreading platform. This study provides detailed analyses of the influence of process parameters such as dosing factor, first layer thickness and recoater velocity on the powder bed quality. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the powder spreading mechanism in LPBF and provide insights to improve the overall bed quality.

When it comes to seeking alternatives to depleting energy sources, specifically fossil fuels, hydrogen could be considered the most clean and efficient carbon-free renewable energy carrier. The hydrogen economy is the integrated system of hydrogen production, hydrogen storage and its utilization in fuel cells. Transition metal-based compositions have recently been a center of research studies for green hydrogen production technology. Transition metal-based composites are considered promising candidates for replacing noble metal-based electrocatalysts due to their abundance, low cost, and good electrocatalytic performance. These inherent properties of transition metal-based composites can be tuned for facilitating hydrogen storage, fuel cell applications, and ammonia production, thus further aiming for a sustainable energy technology. Here, the thesis focuses on the synthesis of transition metals/transition metal oxide/alloy hydride nanostructures for (i) efficient hydrogen storage, (ii) PEM fuel cells as efficient anode electrocatalysts, and (iii) ammonia production using thermal energy.\r\nIn the first section, transition metal nanoparticles (Fe, Co, Ni, Pd) modified, nitrogen-doped carbon nanostructures are shown to be efficient hydrogen storage materials at ambient pressure and room temperature conditions. In the second section, Pt nanoparticles decorated with temperature-annealed and hydrogenated WO3 are demonstrated as a durable and efficient anode electrocatalyst for PEM fuel cell applications.

These technologies facilitate dynamic adaptation to evolving network conditions and user requirements, enhancing overall performance, latency, and efficiency. However, in 6G, the exponential growth of network infrastructure and connected devices will lead to a surge in energy costs, which will make the development of green communications increasingly important and urgent. Implementing energy-efficient design principles and technologies will be essential for sustainable and cost-effective 6G networks.\r\nIn this talk, we explore various energy-efficient ML techniques for green wireless communication systems. Online learning-based ML methods take feedback from the environment in the form of samples, and this feedback is used to update the model iteratively and improve its performance over time. In this work, we first propose an online learning framework for centralized collaborative spectrum sensing in IoT networks, leveraging cognitive radio networks. This approach combines individual sensing results based on the past performance of the detectors. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy to selectively enable sensing at detectors, extending the devices\' field life without compromising accuracy.\r\n\r\nNext, we investigate full-duplex transmission scenarios with a proposed two-stage Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. It is also considered a form of online learning as it learns directly from sequential interactions with an environment, updating its policy based on each experience. DRL methods have significantly enhanced 6G network optimization with exceptional function approximation capabilities because of the neural network architectures involved. Instead of solving multiple smaller problems, DRL-based methods can solve a larger problem only based on feedback from the network, leading to reduced communication overhead.\r\n\r\nDeep models are well known for their exceptional function approximation capabilities. Models can be over-parameterized for a task when they have more parameters than necessary to effectively capture the complexity of the data, leading to increased computational requirements, longer training times, and a higher risk of overfitting. Sparsification of deep networks is necessary to improve efficiency, speed, generalization, interpretability, and energy efficiency. In the next part, we propose a novel activation that helps the models achieve sparsification intrinsically without using regularizers. We introduce the concept of rotating the ReLU activation function, which improves parameter and filter representation capability while significantly reducing memory and computation requirements. This approach achieves better accuracy than state-of-the-art regularization-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness across various datasets and network architectures.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this work contributes to utilizing ML advancements, which can enhance the sparsity and energy efficiency of modern communication systems.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/qfv-cfci-yie','','',1,'2024-06-26 08:18:55','Active'),(685,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL',' â€œActivation of Small Molecules by K2-N , S-Chelated Ruthenium Borate Complexesâ€','Mr. Asif Ahmad (CY18D067)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Sundargopal Ghosh, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/06/28 14:00','2024-06-28','yes','Online-Google Meet','','CY OFFICE','cyoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','ALL ARE WELCOME-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/kbz-aszy-huq','','',1,'2024-06-26 09:47:52','Active'),(686,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\'\'EVOLVING LANDSCAPE OF FINTECH: ROLE OF DIGITAL PAYMENTS ON BANKING AND FINTECH ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\'\'.','Ms. PRIYA, Roll No. MS21D028','Ph.D. SCHOLAR','Prof. M.

The fintech innovations have altered the way financial services are delivered, accessed and consumed, promising greater efficiency, accessibility and inclusion. However, despite the growing relevance of fintech in the financial industry, research in this domain is still in its infancy. The literature review on fintech is limited in volume and somewhat scattered. Hence, considering the need for a review study on fintech, we developed a comprehensive framework-based review using the antecedents, decisions and outcomes (ADO) framework to summarize the complex relationship between different themes and sub-themes originating from the thematic analysis of existing literature and provide future research agenda. We observed that most of the existing research concentrates on the relationship between banks and fintech, particularly focusing on the lending segment. However, they overlook another important aspect, i.e., payment. The growth trajectory of Indiaâ€™s digital payment landscape in the past six to eight years has been remarkable. This expansion has facilitated the nationâ€™s economic shift from a cash-dependent to a cashless economy. As a result, all banks are now aiming to increase their digital payment transactions. Given this context, it is crucial to understand how the growth of digital payments affects the overall health of the banking sector. Therefore, we propose to analyze how the digitalization of payment services, i.e., payment penetration, affects the banking sector\'s profitability, liquidity and credit risk. ADO analysis further underscores a notable gap in the existing literature on the role of fintech in attaining the UN 2030 Vision for Resilient Growth. This vision emphasizes the crucial importance of fintech in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Therefore, we propose to explore how fintech diffusion contributes in achieving different SDGs. \r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','RESEARCH PROPOSAL SEMINAR-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-06-26 11:07:42','Active'),(687,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT OF CYCLONIC WIND-WAVE DYNAMICS IN THE BAY OF BENGAL USING NUMERICAL AND MACHINE LEARNING MODELS','MS.

In thin liquid films, surface tension gradients can be generated by local heating or cooling, which could cause fluid convection. In this study, it is aimed to systematically examine surface tension-driven instability in the form of Marangoni plumes emerging from the bottom of a heated vertical soap film. The spacing between these plumes would provide critical insights into the near-wall physics of turbulent convection.\r\n\r\nSoap films, made from solutions of different surface tension and viscosity, are confined into a copper wire frame, whose lower end is brought into contact with a heated liquid reservoir. The resultant emergence of plumes are visualized using shadowgraphy technique. The spacing between successive plumes (Î») was measured for Rayleigh numbers (Ra) ranging from 103 to 105. The near-wall dynamics reveal that plumes initiate at certain points, elongate, and eventually merge. An increase in Rayleigh number leads to a greater number of closely and regularly spaced plumes. The plume formation is characterized by an initial transient state with exponential variation in plume spacing over time, followed by a steady-state phase of invariance in plume spacing. It is shown that the plume spacing in both steady and transient stages vary as Ra-1/3. The instability is understood in terms of the balance between buoyancy, viscous, and Marangoni forces.

Thus, to address the environmental issues arising from the disposal of exhausted lubricating oils/grease of conventional oil journal/rolling element bearings, there is a need for explorations to develop environment-friendly, energy-efficient and maintenance-free air bearings. These bearings use air as the lubricating medium, which is freely available in nature and has non-degradable properties. The use of atmospheric air as lubricant eliminates the need for complex oil supply systems and air compressors. The high speed of the rotor and the sub-ambient condition in the bearing drag the atmospheric air inside the convergent zone, leading to the pressure generation in the air film, which supports the loaded rotor. These bearings possess compact and simple geometry, yield low friction, low noise, and insignificant heating, and operate in oil/grease-free environments at elevated speeds. Presently, these bearings are seen in micro-turbomachines (turbochargers of modern high-speed electric vehicles, fuel cells of hydrogen-based turbomachines, turbopumps of space launch vehicles, environment control units of commercial and fighter aircrafts, biomedical centrifuges, printed circuit boards (PCBs) manufacturing instruments, food processing and pharmaceutical devices) to support and guide relatively lightly-loaded and high-speed rotors, where hazardous chemical (lubricating oil/grease) cannot be used, and frequent acceleration/retardation of the rotor is normal.\r\n	Despite their eco-friendly nature, such bearings experience three major drawbacks preventing their large-scale industrial use. First, rotors supported on them are typically light; second, such rotors are typically operated for shorter durations; third, rotors supported on such bearings show poor dynamic behavior due to fluid-induced instabilities. Thus, in pursuit of developing aerodynamic bearings for operating at high loads with improved rotordynamics, firstly, attempts have been made to understand the tribodynamic behaviors of rotors supported on conventional aerodynamic bearings. Then, a few novel aerodynamic bearing bores were indigenously developed with significantly improved tribodynamic performances compared to conventional bores. Similarly, the rotors supported on self-acting air journal bearings typically operate at very high rotational speeds of the order of 10,000 to 300,000 rpm. In this process, frequent accelerations to /retardations from such high speeds are prevalent. During these cycles, the rotors experience whirling of high amplitude, which is undesirable from a safety point of view. Therefore, research to explore the rotordynamic response of accelerating/retarding rotors supported on self-acting air bearings is also being explored to propose suitable acceleration/retardation schedules to keep the whirling amplitude and frequency as minimum as possible during the acceleration/retardation phase.\r\n	Although the adaptability of such a clean technology, â€˜air lubrication,â€™ has been paramount in many developed countries, India is yet to reach that level. The research on â€˜clean & green air lubricationâ€™ for future industrial machinery is one of many state-of-the-art green technologies with a zero carbon emission capability. It can potentially replace hazardous oil/grease used in present machines for lubrication and is beneficial, especially from the point-of-view of the â€˜sustainable industrial revolution.â€™ With India\'s vision to achieve the â€˜Net Zeroâ€™ target by 2070, this technology has tremendous potential for sustainable development and self-reliance. Therefore, to create awareness among the research and industrial community about this exciting technology, the present talk will cover the fundamentals of air lubrication theory, the past and ongoing research in this field across the globe, and the future of air lubrication in modern machinery for sustainable development. \r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/vqe-upio-vmk','','',1,'2024-06-27 05:59:41','Active'),(693,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Subthreshold background Stimulation: Reduction of Thresholds for Tactile Displays','Mr. Rahul Kumar Ray (AM17D008)','Ph.D research scholar, Dept. of Applied Mechanics & Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras\r\n','Guide : Prof. M.

These displays leverage different technologies such as electrotactile displays, vibrotactile displays, electrovibration, and ultrasonic displays to stimulate the cutaneous receptors beneath the skin, enabling users to perceive a wide range of tactile sensations, including tingling, tickling, pressure, stretch, and vibration. Among these technologies, electrotactile and electrovibration displays stand out for their ability to provide high spatial resolution feedback while consuming relatively lower power than mechanical counterparts. However, despite their advantages, prolonged usage of these electrical displays has been associated with discomfort, including skin irritation and occasional burns reported by users.\r\n\r\nAddressing these safety concerns, our study introduces a novel approach for threshold reduction in electrical displays by employing background stimulation of other modalities at subthreshold levels. This innovative method aims to enhance user safety and comfort during prolonged usage of tactile displays. Through four psychophysical studies, we investigated different strategies for reducing the perception threshold of electrotactile stimuli. We conducted four experiments to prove the hypothesis. In the first experiment, Electrotactile Vibrotactile (ETVT), we applied a 10% subthreshold vibrotactile stimulus, resulting in a 3 to 5% reduction in the threshold for electrotactile stimuli. In the second experiment, Electrotactile with Thermal Stimulation (ETTS) study, we induced a 7Â°C increase in skin temperature, leading to a significant 15\\% reduction in the threshold for electrotactile stimuli. In third experiment, our research explored the spatial summation of electrotactile displays at subthreshold levels. In the fourth experiment, we investigated the potential of using subthreshold electrotactile stimulation in the background to reduce the threshold for electrovibration displays. Notably, the latter approach resulted in a 12.46% reduction in the threshold for electrovibration, demonstrating its efficacy in enhancing the safety and usability of tactile interfaces. By significantly lowering the perception threshold across various tactile display technologies, our study contributes to mitigating the risk of discomfort and potential harm associated with prolonged use, thereby fostering greater user acceptance and adoption of tactile feedback systems in diverse applications.\r\n','HoD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/ejf-odby-hue','','',1,'2024-06-27 08:56:45','Active'),(694,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Approximation Techniques for CNN Inference for resource-constrained Devices.

Due to the substantial number of multiply and accumulate operations (MAC) and parameters, implementing these networks becomes challenging on resource-limited devices.\r\nMost of these techniques like pruning and bitwidth reduction introduce irregular network structures with non-standard bitwidth. We need specialized hardware that handles sparse matrices with arbitrary precision to realize the savings obtained using these methods. In this work, we aim to have the computations and parameters of CNNs reduced for the inference phase without altering the regular structure and bitwidth.\r\nIn the permuted features approach (PF), we showed that the weights in FC layers can be modeled as permutations of a common sequence with minimal impact on recognition accuracy. This allows the storage requirements of FC layer(s) to be significantly reduced, which is reflected in the reduction of total network parameters from 1.3Ã— to 36 Ã— with a median of 4.45Ã— on several benchmark networks. \r\nIn the subset selection method, we have proposed linear approximation (LA) and low kernel approximation (LK) techniques to reduce the computations in the convolution layers to exploit the less important features identified using a subset selection process. The linear approximation method shows a 15 â€“ 80% savings in MAC operations with a median of 52% reduction and the lower kernel method shows a 33 â€“ 95% reduction in MAC operations with a median of 65% in the required number of computations with only a marginal 1% loss in accuracy across several benchmark datasets.\r\nIn the QRCNN framework, we enforce orthogonality in the Conv layers which orders the kernels from most important to least important. We show graceful degradation of performance while dropping kernels in the convolutional layers without the need for retraining. The proposed method can achieve a reduction in the number of MAC computations of 18 â€“ 56% with a median of 36%. The speedup achieved using this approach is measured on three compute platforms namely 8GB RAM Raspberry Pi 4B (embedded platform), Octa-Core Intel i7 processor with 64GB RAM, and NVidia Quadro K2200 (GPU) with 4GB memory. \r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/gud-huce-snd','','',1,'2024-06-28 03:49:15','Active'),(695,'seminar','Technical Talk','NULL','Prince Rupertâ€™s Drops','Prof. Srinivasan Chandrasekar','Srinivasan Chandrasekar is Professor in the Schools of Industrial Engineering and Materials Engineering at Purdue University.

The present work focuses on the effect of horizontal oscillation in a liquid-liquid system on the instability threshold and wave amplitude response. The response of two incompressible and immiscible liquids of comparable densities at different depth ratios (h_r=h_2/h_1) in a rectangular container subject to horizontal sinusoidal oscillation has been performed experimentally. A container of 300 x 20 x 50 mm3 has been considered which reduces the end wall effects. Under a high-frequency, interface exhibits a saw-tooth pattern at high enough forcing amplitude, commonly known as frozen waves analogous to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. In the present study, aqueous solution of potassium iodide-olive oil liquid pair has been considered. Frozen waves are observed when forcing frequency satisfies certain conditions of geometrical and fluid property combinations. Otherwise, partially-frozen wave is also observed. Threshold of frozen wave increases with increase in depth ratio. However, the slope of the wave amplitude response with forcing parameter reduces with increase in depth ratio. At higher forcing amplitude secondary instability is observed in spanwise direction leading to three dimensional frozen wave which has been characterized','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/xud-droa-rdd ','','',1,'2024-06-28 05:57:48','Active'),(697,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- நாட்காட்டி (naatkaatti)\r\nHindi word	- तिथि-सूची, कैलेंडर (tithi-soochi, calendar)\r\nEnglish word	- Calendar\r\n','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-06-28 06:07:53','default_value'),(698,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','End-to-End Speech Synthesis Systems for Indian Languages','Ms. Anusha Prakash (EE17D039)','Ph.D scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','\r\nGuide: Dr. S.

With the emergence of neural network based end-to-end (E2E) approaches, training TTS systems has become easier when a large amount of data is available for a language. However, developing E2E speech synthesisers for Indian languages presents unique challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality training data and multiple grapheme representations across different languages.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this thesis is to train high-quality E2E TTS systems for Indian languages. We first develop a unified representation to handle the issue of different scripts across languages. Next, multilingual TTS systems are trained based on language families, which are then extended to accommodate new languages having limited or no data, but belonging to the same language family. The aim is to exploit the phonotactic similarities across languages belonging to the same family. The analyses show that language family-wise training of Indic systems is the way forward for the Indian subcontinent, where a large number of languages are spoken.\r\n\r\nSentences in Indian languages are generally longer than those in English. Indian languages are also considered to be phrase-based, wherein semantically complete phrases are concatenated to make up sentences. We explore an inter-pausal unit (IPU) based approach in the E2E framework, focusing on synthesising conversational-style text. The IPU-based approach requires less computational resources and produces prosodically richer synthesis compared to conventional sentence-based systems. In the last part of the thesis, we highlight the importance of accurate phone alignments for TTS system building using a signal processing directed alignment approach.\r\n\r\nOur research underscores the significance of seamlessly integrating linguistic knowledge and signal-processing techniques within the E2E framework. Our findings show that the proposed models outperform state-of-the-art TTS systems available for Indian languages. Most importantly, the methodologies proposed in this thesis are highly adaptable, being largely independent of specific architectural constraints. As such, they can be readily applied to other emerging E2E architectures.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/cgu-hiuj-njm','','',1,'2024-06-28 06:09:25','Active'),(699,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','On Succinct Data Structures for Certain Generalisations of Interval Graphs','Mr. Girish Balakrishnan, Roll No: CS19D012','Ph.D. Research Scholar','Dr. Siva Ram Murthy C','Computer Science and Engineering','2024/07/04 11:30','2024-07-04','','A M Turing Hall (SSB 334, Second Floor)','In this work, we explore generalizations of interval graphs based on three different graph parameters, \r\nnamely, boxicity d > 0, interval number t > 0, and vertex leafage k > 0 by designing succinct data structures for \r\nthem.

Depending on aneurysm size, shape and location they need to be managed either through clipping or an endovascular coiling intervention. Due to the inherent advantages, endovascular coiling (EVC) is emerging as the treatment of choice for intracranial aneurysms (IAs). When coiled, reduced hemodynamic activity enables the coil to get thrombosed and achieve flow stasis. However, aneurysm recurrence and rupture after the treatment, due to improper coiling are issues of concern. Present study investigates the role of coil fill volume and packing density on the aneurysm for patient-specific conditions.

Due to the inherent advantages, endovascular coiling (EVC) is emerging as the treatment of choice for intracranial aneurysms (IAs). When coiled, reduced hemodynamic activity enables the coil to get thrombosed and achieve flow stasis. However, aneurysm recurrence and rupture after the treatment, due to improper coiling are issues of concern.

The ability to extract source properties crucially depends on our prior knowledge of the signal morphology. Even though binary black hole (BBH) mergers are the cleanest system to model in general relativity, currently there are no waveform models which include all physical effects. In this thesis we focus on three subdominant effects namely the orbital eccentricity, spin-precession, and higher order modes (HMs). We study the interplay of these effects on data analysis of GW signals, highlighting the short-comings and emphasizing the need for more advanced waveforms. For instance, we investigate whether the orbital eccentricity and spin-precession can mimic each other, and thus caution the GW community towards the biases that may arise due to the neglect of eccentricity and/or spins in the waveform models. Using waveforms with full spin-precession and HMs, we extend the existing spin-induced quadrupole moment (SIQM) test â€“ a null test to distinguish BBH systems from other black hole mimickers â€“ and show that these improved waveforms give significantly better bounds. Additionally, we also quantify the parameter space where the effect of HMs is most significant, and show the importance of detecting these modes in GW events for future ground-based GW detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope.','HoD Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/qyy-yozy-zgr','','',1,'2024-06-28 10:21:23','Active'),(709,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Ph.D Seminar Talk - II  - DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADAPTIVE BUS PRIORITY SOLUTION','Ms. Nazia Tazin Imran, Roll No. CE20D004','Ph.D Research Scholar','Dr. Lelitha Devi - Guide, Dr. Benny Raphael - DC Member, Dr. Bhargava Rama Chilukuri  - DC Member, Dr. Shankar Ram C S ( ED), Dr. Robinson R G - Chairperson','Civil Engineering','2024/07/05 15:00','2024-07-05','yes','BSB 368, Visveswaraya Seminar Hall (VSH), Second Floor','Increased vehicle ownership has resulted in traffic congestion, necessitating the need to design and manage the existing transportation systems in such a way that the efficiency of high-occupancy vehicles could be enhanced. Bus signal priority (BSP) is one such affordable and less infrastructure-demanding method that is capable of enhancing the effectiveness and reliability of transit vehicles. The existing literature in this area mainly assumed uniform arrivals and no random fluctuations, even though it is very common in the field to have non-uniform arrivals within cycles and random fluctuations between cycles. In addition, they mainly focused on split phasing, did not consider oversaturated conditions, were computationally intensive making them difficult for field implementation, and considered homogenous traffic environments. The present study tries to address these gaps and develops a simple bus signal priority solution, which is computationally less intensive, making it feasible for real-time implementation under advanced signal phasing strategies. The basic objective is to minimize the overall person delay at the intersection, considering all vehicles in all approaches, and priority to buses is given only if the total person delay at the intersection with the BSP is less than that without BSP. The incremental queue accumulation (IQA) method, which can address the variations in arrivals, is adopted to take into account the randomness in vehicle arrivals into the delay calculations. In this study, overlap signal phasing is also used to make better use of green times and reduce its wastage to mitigate the impact of the imbalanced demand on various approaches at an intersection. The proposed bus signal priority solution further takes into account the randomness in the vehicle arrivals at the intersection both within a signal cycle and among various signal cycles. The evaluation results indicate that irrespective of the priority strategies executed in a cycle, the total person delay at the intersection was reduced. The results also revealed that the proposed solution is efficient in capturing the variations in vehicle arrivals, thus reducing the total person delay at the intersection by about 45%.\r\nThe developed solution is then extended to provide priority to buses under over-saturated traffic conditions, where it is very difficult for the vehicles to clear the intersection in the same cycle. The developed analytical model is implemented and evaluated by integrating it with VISSIM micro-simulation.\r\n','R.

Thus, to address the environmental issues arising from the disposal of exhausted lubricating oils/grease of conventional oil journal/rolling element bearings, there is a need for explorations to develop environment-friendly, energy-efficient and maintenance-free air bearings. These bearings use air as the lubricating medium, which is freely available in nature and has non-degradable properties. The use of atmospheric air as lubricant eliminates the need for complex oil supply systems and air compressors. The high speed of the rotor and the sub-ambient condition in the bearing drag the atmospheric air inside the convergent zone, leading to the pressure generation in the air film, which supports the loaded rotor. These bearings possess compact and simple geometry, yield low friction, low noise, and insignificant heating, and operate in oil/grease-free environments at elevated speeds. Presently, these bearings are seen in micro-turbomachines (turbochargers of modern high-speed electric vehicles, fuel cells of hydrogen-based turbomachines, turbopumps of space launch vehicles, environment control units of commercial and fighter aircrafts, biomedical centrifuges, printed circuit boards (PCBs) manufacturing instruments, food processing and pharmaceutical devices) to support and guide relatively lightly-loaded and high-speed rotors, where hazardous chemical (lubricating oil/grease) cannot be used, and frequent acceleration/retardation of the rotor is normal.\r\nDespite their eco-friendly nature, such bearings experience three major drawbacks preventing their large-scale industrial use. First, rotors supported on them are typically light; second, such rotors are typically operated for shorter durations; third, rotors supported on such bearings show poor dynamic behavior due to fluid-induced instabilities. Thus, in pursuit of developing aerodynamic bearings for operating at high loads with improved rotordynamics, firstly, attempts have been made to understand the tribodynamic behaviors of rotors supported on conventional aerodynamic bearings. Then, a few novel aerodynamic bearing bores were indigenously developed with significantly improved tribodynamic performances compared to conventional bores. Similarly, the rotors supported on self-acting air journal bearings typically operate at very high rotational speeds of the order of 10,000 to 300,000 rpm. In this process, frequent accelerations to /retardations from such high speeds are prevalent. During these cycles, the rotors experience whirling of high amplitude, which is undesirable from a safety point of view. Therefore, research to explore the rotordynamic response of accelerating/retarding rotors supported on self-acting air bearings is also being explored to propose suitable acceleration/retardation schedules to keep the whirling amplitude and frequency as minimum as possible during the acceleration/retardation phase.\r\n\r\nAlthough the adaptability of such a clean technology, â€˜air lubrication,â€™ has been paramount in many developed countries, India is yet to reach that level. The research on â€˜clean & green air lubricationâ€™ for future industrial machinery is one of many state-of-the-art green technologies with a zero carbon emission capability. It can potentially replace hazardous oil/grease used in present machines for lubrication and is beneficial, especially from the point-of-view of the â€˜sustainable industrial revolution.â€™ With India\'s vision to achieve the â€˜Net Zeroâ€™ target by 2070, this technology has tremendous potential for sustainable development and self-reliance. Therefore, to create awareness among the research and industrial community about this exciting technology, the present talk will cover the fundamentals of air lubrication theory, the past and ongoing research in this field across the globe, and the future of air lubrication in modern machinery for sustainable development.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/vqe-upio-vmk','','',1,'2024-07-01 02:47:41','Active'),(712,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€œCATALYST SYNTHESIS AND DESIGN FOR ENHANCED SELECTIVE REDUCTION OF NOX USING PROPYLENE: A COMBINED EXPERIMENTAL AND MODELLING APPROACHâ€','Mr. K SHIVARAJ KUMAR (CH17D410), PHD RESEARCH SCHOLAR','PHD RESEARCH SCHOLAR, DEPARTMENT OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, IIT MADRAS','Chairperson: Dr. RAVI KRISHNA R, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, IIT Madras;  \r\nExaminer: Dr. A K SURESH, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, IIT Bombay;  \r\nExaminer: Dr. VINU R, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, IIT Madras;  \r\nCo-Guide: Dr. SELVAM P, Dept. of Chemistry, IIT Madras;  \r\nGuide: Dr. PREETI AGHALAYAM, Dept. of Chemical Engineering, IIT Madras.','DEPARTMENT OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, IIT MADRAS','2024/07/04 10:00','2024-07-04','yes','ONLINE: https://meet.google.com/oqy-mtbs-jdi','The increasing global population and economic growth are causing an increase in energy demand. This increase in energy demand is primarily met by the use of fossil fuels in various energy sectors. However, the combustion of these fuels, particularly at high temperatures, leads to the formation of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which have detrimental effects on both health and the environment. In the case of vehicular exhausts, regulatory limits on NOx emissions have led to a notable decrease emission over time. Although the conventional three-way catalytic converters can control emissions from standard gasoline engines, their effectiveness decreases when it comes to reducing NOx in lean-burn and diesel engines. These engines typically operate in an oxygen-rich environment, promoting NOx oxidation over reduction. To address this challenge, there is a need to develop catalyst systems capable of selectively reducing NOx, even in the presence of excess oxygen, with the help of a reducing agent. This requirement has led to the development of a efficient technology known as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to achieve NOx reduction using a reducing agent.\r\nThe effectiveness of Ag-based catalyst systems for selectively reducing NOx using propylene as the reducing agent is explored in this study. The performance of catalyst is highly influenced by its synthesis process. Various methods for synthesizing Ag-based catalysts are analyzed, and their performance is evaluated through experiments in an in-house developed laboratory packed bed reactor. Further, the study focuses on an optimized one-pot synthesis approach known as single-step sol-gel (SSG) synthesis, which outperforms other catalyst preparation methods. The impact of synthesis conditions, particularly synthesis pH, on the structural, textural, and morphological characteristics of Ag/Î³-Al2O3 synthesized via SSG is investigated. This includes its activity for hydrocarbon-based selective catalytic reduction (HC-SCR) in a packed-bed reactor, which is studied through a combination of experimental work and simulations. The optimized catalyst exhibits good performance, achieving over 90% NOx conversion under typical operating conditions and maintaining high activity over a broad temperature range (300-600â„ƒ). Moreover, the catalyst demonstrates stable performance for 50 hours, as examined in time-on-stream studies. Furthermore, the catalyst proves effective even under diverse reactor operating conditions, including higher inlet oxygen concentrations, different feed conditions, and various space velocities.\r\nAlthough the optimized Ag/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated high NOx conversions at medium to high temperature ranges, it exhibited low to moderate NOx conversions at low temperatures. Given that exhaust gas temperatures range from 150 to 500Â°C, achieving NOx elimination across this entire temperature range is crucial yet challenging. The addition of small amounts of Pt to modify the Ag/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst resulted in improvements in NOx conversions at low temperatures. The Pt loading was optimized at 0.01% - 0.03% Pt to 5% Ag/Î³-Al2O3. This optimized Ag-Pt/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst showed enhanced NOx conversion across a broader activity temperature window, with only a slight decrease in activity at high temperatures.\r\nTo understand the relationship between catalytic properties and activity, and their correlation, a global kinetic model is proposed. To account for variations in catalytic properties resulting from differences in catalyst preparation methods, changes in synthesis conditions, and variations in active metal (Ag) loadings, we introduced a physically meaningful parameter known as Ag surface density (ÏƒAg). This parameter represents the density of Ag atoms per nmÂ² of the catalyst surface and takes into account various factors that influence catalytic properties. By formulating simple polynomial expressions for sensitive rate constants based on ÏƒAg and incorporating these relations into the packed-bed reactor (PFR) equation, a simplified global kinetic model is developed. This model successfully validates experimental NOx conversion data across different literature reports, spanning from Seker et al.â€™s work in 1999 to our present study Kummari et al. (2023). The scope of the model encompasses various concentrations of reactant feed components (NO, C3H6, and O2), different flow rates, gas-hourly space velocities, and catalyst amounts in the reactor. To enhance selective NOx reduction, this study suggests optimizing catalytic properties to achieve an Ag surface density (ÏƒAg) close to 1.0. Additionally, optimal operating conditions are identified to achieve high NOx conversions over a wide temperature range. This involves introducing a small amount of propylene into the diesel exhaust stream and increasing the catalyst-bed volume to facilitate longer interactions between reactants and the catalyst, accommodating higher exhaust flow rates. These modifications substantially enhance NOx conversion rates across a broader temperature window. \r\nOverall, this study offers fundamental insights into Ag/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst preparation and optimization of synthesis procedures. It explores the influence of catalyst preparation methods and synthesis conditions on catalytic properties and activities. Additionally, the research provides valuable insights into the relationships between catalyst structure and activity, offering practical strategies for enhancing NOx reduction in exhaust gases through experimental and modelling approaches.','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/oqy-mtbs-jdi','seminar01-07-2024 03:14','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar01-07-2024 03:14',1,'2024-07-01 03:14:52','Active'),(713,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','â€œMICROSTRUCTURE-RHEOLOGY CORRELATIONS IN POLYMER NANOCOMPOSITESâ€','MR.

The size, shape, concentration of filler particles and the polymer-filler interaction determine these properties. These factors lead to a wide range of microstructures that dictates  thermophysical properties of a composite1.  The correlations between the microstructures of PNCs and their properties are not well understood. In this thesis,  we use mesoscale simulations to understand and establish correlation between microstructure and rheological properties of PNCs. We consider various shapes of nanoparticles, such as quantum dots (QDs), nanorods (NRs), tetrapod (TPs), and oligomer grafted spherical nanoparticle (GNP) in a polymer matrix and, perform large-scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations to capture the microstructures of these composites. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations were carried out to evaluate their viscosities. The viscosity of GNP systems is evaluated as a function of crucial parameters such as NP loading, grafting density, polymer chain length, and matrix chain length. Based on these simulations, we propose new microstructure-rheology correlations of PNCs. Moreover, an attempt was made to quantify the effective potential of mean force (PMF) between a pair of GNPs using a neural network model.2 \r\n\r\nReferences\r\n(1)	Kalathi, J. T.; Grest, G.

Even as the pandemic recedes, organizations continue to permit their employees to work in hybrid mode, splitting their time between office and home. Even though hybrid work environment provides flexibility to employees, this transition has brought various challenges to organizations regarding their security infrastructure. As the boundaries between personal and professional spaces blur, it becomes crucial to understand the employeeâ€™s motivational factors behind intentional non-compliance with Information Security Policies (ISP) established by the organizations. This is especially relevant as violations of these policies can lead to insider threats within the organization. As per industry reports, insider threats in organizations have increased in recent years with the rise of remote and hybrid working models. This rise in security concerns highlights the difficulty in securing distributed and less controlled work environments, as in the case of remote and hybrid working models. Technological solutions, to an extent, can provide insight into the \"what\" and \"how\" aspects of insider threats and information security violations, but they cannot explain the \"why\" aspect of violations. Since understanding humans requires psychology rather than technology, this highlights the need for research in behavioral cybersecurity.  Our first study will identify common and distinct factors influencing employeesâ€™ compliance and violation of information security policies. Our second study will focus on understanding the influence of certain factors identified in the first study that might impact intentional ISP violations of employees in remote and hybrid work environments. In the third study, we will seek insights from top-level management regarding their perceptions of employeesâ€™ information security policy violations in remote and hybrid settings. To achieve this, we plan to conduct in-depth interviews with Chief Executives, Chief Information Security Officers, and other top-level cyber security leaders across various organizations. We anticipate that this dual perspective will be instrumental in developing targeted strategies to encourage compliance and mitigate the risk of insider threats.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','RESEARCH PROPOSAL SEMINAR-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-01 03:39:28','Active'),(715,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL',' â€œDesign and Development of TiO2 Tubular Structures for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting and Rare Earth-Based Oxide Materials for Methanol Electrooxidationâ€','Ms. Shuchi Sharma (CY18D109)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Professor Ranga Rao G, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/07/03 11:00','2024-07-03','yes','Online-Google Meet','','CY OFFICE','cyoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','ALL ARE WELCOME-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/xzm-wdzr-osm','','',1,'2024-07-01 04:00:18','Active'),(716,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Investigation on the functionalization of Additively Manufactured Ti alloy using surface Grinding Process ','Ms. Mehsana Ahmed (ME21S077)','MS Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide Name: Dr. N Arunachalam /\r\nGTC Members: 1) Dr. K.

The research investigates the effect of grinding parameters, specifically cutting speed, depth of cut, and feed rate, on EBM-produced Ti-6Al-4V using a SiC grinding wheel. It analyzes the influence of these processing conditions on grinding force, energy, uncut chip thickness, surface texture and chip morphology. A comparative study between EBM and wrought Ti-6Al-4V alloys under identical grinding conditions is conducted to provide further insights. The key influencing parameters and their range for the effective processing of these additive-manufactured components are identified. The results prove that grinding improves the overall finish by achieving a consistent surface texture. Based on the initial surface roughness, the grinding process with chosen process conditions is used to functionalize the EBM-made Ti-6Al-4V alloy.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/grc-bzib-ucv','','',1,'2024-07-01 04:18:02','Active'),(717,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Residual Stress Evolution During Laser Additive Manufacturing of Alloy-718 Components:  Computational and Experimental Approach','Mr. Uday Pratap Singh (MM18D032),','PhD Research Scholar at the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering','Dr G Phanikamar (Guide), Dept. of MME, IIT Madras','Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering','2024/07/02 15:00','2024-07-02','','Online (Google-meet)','Laser additive manufacturing (LAM) has the potential to revolutionize product design by combining several functions in a single piece of complex part that was previously impossible to manufacture using other technologies. This technology has provided engineers and designers with an entirely new toolbox to use when creating complex parts with a high degree of precision, increasing reliability and reducing weight and cost. LAM opportunities also enable individuals and corporations to take control of their environmental footprint by reducing product waste and making products lighter and more energy-efficient.\r\nDue to the high scanning speed and concentrated laser beam used in the LAM process, a rapid solidification situation with a high-temperature gradient and cooling rate is created. Rapid solidification conditions coupled with remelting/reheating result in a high amount of residual stress, elemental microsegregation, and microstructural anisotropy in as-build conditions. This process-induced residual stress, porosity, and textured microstructure are the most challenging obstacles when designing quality components using this process and have a detrimental impact on the reliability and structural integrity of the deposited components.\r\nBoth computational and experimental methodologies were utilized to overcome the above-mentioned obstacle. To determine the spatiotemporal evolution of residual stress during the sequential layer build-up for the selected geometry and process parameter, a sequentially coupled thermo-mechanical simulation was performed. The material properties of the finite element (FE) model are calibrated through the experimental flow curve generated from Gleeble-3800Â®. X-ray tomography and Electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) techniques were utilized to quantify the process-induced porosity (distribution and size) and crystallographic texture in the solidified component, respectively.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning-based algorithms run faster largely because of the parallel computing frameworks and computing power of GPUs (graphics processing units). GPU Computing is the unsung hero behind the recent success of AI/ML. Mostly, GPU-based parallelization is used for high-performance computing in data centres and supercomputers. Many practical problems are NP-hard and are unlikely to have polynomial time algorithms. There is plenty of literature on polynomial-time approximation algorithms for such problems. Even some asymptotically efficient polynomial-time algorithms involve a lot of complex data structures, posing severe challenges during their efficient implementation. Therefore, there is a need for efficient sequential and parallel implementations. We have built scalable, efficient, parallel and benchmark implementations on multi-core CPU and GPU for two approximation algorithms of NP-hard problems: the Steiner Tree Problem (STP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP).\r\n    Our participation in the DIMACS and PACE challenges made us aware of the need for good algorithms that run well in practice, and parallelization would greatly benefit. We observe that NP-hard problems can offer unique challenges. In this thesis, we propose various mechanisms for taming these challenges in parallelization that are, in general, applicable to other approximation algorithms or graph problems. Current literature on the parallelization of algorithms for NP-hard problems lacks faster, effective, open-source, reproducible and scalable implementations (on large inputs) with solutions closer to the known optimum. In this regard, we have parallelized a two-approximation algorithm for Steiner Tree on GPU in a novel way. Similarly, we have designed and implemented a parallelization-friendly local-search algorithm for CVRP using randomization of different depth-first traversals of a minimum spanning tree. We have developed novel algorithmic optimizations (running multiple single-source-shortest-paths (SSSP) computations, SSSP halt) and parallelization-specific optimizations. Our implementations also encompass some of the existing optimizations followed in the literature, and we have made the code open-source to encourage reproducibility. On the largest benchmark instances, our code is 20x faster (in terms of running time) over the sequential-CPU Open Graph algorithms and Data structure (OGDF) KMB\'s two-approximation implementation (for Steiner Tree Problem) and 36x faster than the state-of-the-art GPU codes (for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem) producing better solutions than their baselines. Our parallelization techniques developed from this thesis can be, in general, applicable to other hard graph problems and their algorithms as well.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Parallelization; Approximation Algorithms; Graph Algorithms; Steiner Tree; Vehicle Routing;  GPUs; CUDA; OpenMP;','CS Office','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/giy-ycqi-quv','','',1,'2024-07-01 04:50:40','Active'),(719,'seminar','Technical Talk','NULL','\"X-ray Diffraction, In-situ & In-operando-Applications and the latest Developments\"','Mr. Jitendra Kumar, Anton Paar India.

Of particular interest and appeal are the universality and the critical exponents that govern phase transitions of seemingly disparate phenomena. The inclusion of strongly interacting physics into the picture makes it more novel and vibrant. Two-dimensional electrons under a strong perpendicular magnetic field leads to an array of highly correlated many-body states, the fractional quantum Hall state (FQHS) being one of the most exciting and intriguing among them. Extensive studies of disorder-induced localization have led to the emergence of a universal scaling picture in the case of non-interacting integer quantum Hall states (IQHS). However, a comprehensive study in the strongly interacting FQHS regime is scarce. Here, we report scaling measurements in the FQHS regime where interaction plays a dominant role. This study is motivated by recent calculations, based on the composite fermion theory, that suggest identical critical exponents in both IQHS and FQHS cases to the extent that the interaction between composite fermions is negligible. Finally, I will also briefly touch upon some new results that shed light on the effect of interactions and the resulting critical exponents in the IQHS regime.','Prof. Manu Jaiswal','manu.jaiswal@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-01 05:00:34','Active'),(721,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','MANAGEMENT MODELS TO CONTROL NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM TIDAL RIVERS','Mr. Chandra Sekhar Akella, Roll No. CE11D013','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. B S Murty - Guide, Dr. Balaji Narasimhan - DC Member, Dr. K P Sudheer - DC Member, Dr. Shankar Narasimhan (CH) - DC member, Dr. Mukesh Doble - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head, CE','Civil Engineering','2024/07/03 11:30','2024-07-03','yes','BSB 104 (Conference Room)','','R.

One of the example applications of such systems is to sample and model physical phenomena at spatiotemporal scales. Spatial fields commonly occurring in nature consist of hotspots exhibiting extreme measurements and much higher spatial variability than the rest of the field, which is characterized by continuous, positively skewed, spatially correlated measurements. In this talk, I present algorithms and strategies to achieve efficient robotic sampling and reconstruction of non-uniform spatial fields.  To collect data for modeling such fields, I apply informed path planning: a data collection strategy that computes paths to be traversed by a robot while considering resource constraints, such as power availability, and the uncertainty of the resulting model that should be minimized.

Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which deliver cholesterol uncontrollably to artery-wall macrophages, have been identified as a primary factor in the progression of CVD. In this context, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a plasma glycoprotein, came into the spotlight for its role in lipid metabolism, where it facilitates the bidirectional exchange of cholesteryl esters (CE) and triglycerides (TG) between HDL and LDL or VLDL, thus maintaining cholesterol levels. Some studies have shown that the impairment of the lipid exchange processes of CETP can be an effective strategy for treating CVDs. Many small molecule inhibitors have gone into the clinical phase, but none have been successful. Given the complexity of lipid metabolism and the pivotal role of CETP in it, understanding the CETP structure, CETP inhibition, and the mechanism by which CETP transfers neutral lipids is of prime importance. Though crystal structures of substrate- and inhibitor-bound CETP are available, very little is known concerning the mechanism of lipid transfer and how this protein interacts with the lipoproteins. This study aims to elucidate the detailed mechanism by which CETP facilitates the transfer of neutral lipids between lipoproteins using advanced Molecular Dynamics simulations. Additionally, by investigating the inhibition mechanisms of CETP, the study seeks to uncover novel approaches for CETP inhibition, thereby advancing therapeutic strategies for CVD interventions.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-01 06:32:42','Active'),(726,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\'\'â€˜â€™ HOW PASSION FOR WORK SHAPES WORK - FAMILY INTERACTIONS:UNFOLDING THE ROLES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CAPITAL, SELF-REGULATION FAILURE AND CULTURAL DIMENSIONS â€“ A CROSS â€“ CULTURAL INQUIRY AMONG ENTERPRENEURS IN INDIA AND GERMANYâ€™â€™','Ms.SREELEKSHMI CHANDRAN, Roll No.MS18D009','Ph.D. SCHOLAR','Dr. V.

Harmonious work\r\npassion also boosted psychological capital, leading to enhanced\r\nwork-family enrichment across both groups, and negatively impacted\r\nself-regulation failure, contributing to work-family conflict. The\r\npositive effect of obsessive work passion on self-regulation failure\r\nand subsequent work-family conflict was specifically noted in the\r\nGerman sample. Psychological capital and self-regulation were\r\nsignificant mediators in the relationship between work passion and the\r\nwork-family interface for both Indian and German entrepreneurs.\r\nMultigroup analyses showed that the path from obsessive work passion\r\nto work-family conflict was stronger among Indian participants, while\r\nthe link between self-regulation failure and work-family conflict was\r\nmore pronounced among German entrepreneurs, possibly due to the\r\nprominence of specific cultural  dimensions in India and Germany.\r\nCultural dimensions such as activity orientation, specific-diffuse\r\norientation, and vertical and horizontal collectivism moderated the\r\nlink between work passion and work-family outcomes in both samples.\r\nThe findings emphasize the importance of considering cultural factors,\r\nindividual traits, and situational contexts in understanding the\r\nimpact of work passion on work-family enrichment and conflict.

Of the resolved cases, 56% adopted resolution plans, while 44% are in the process or have undergone liquidation. The sudden increase in CIRP filings, along with a growing number of non-performing loans, indicates the prevalence of financial distress among many corporates. To avert the catastrophe, bankruptcy prediction models have been consistently attempting to mitigate the consequences of distress by providing early warning signals. Despite a host of research and varied models to predict distress, there is a lot of uncertainty and inconclusiveness as most models are sensitive to time, industry, and the country\'s financial and economic situations.\r\nFurther, studies identifying signals about a distressed firm\'s deteriorating condition over time are rare, with subjective definitions of distress. Therefore, the first objective of this study is to identify firm-specific signals of financial distress and their impact using a hybrid model by combining variables from accounting, market, and reporting anomalies. The findings indicate that return on assets, asset turnover ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, market capitalization, market value of equity to book value of debt, and book-to-market ratio serve as credible signals of impending distress. While the â€˜reporting anomalyâ€™ index enhances the model\'s explanatory power, the results exhibit inconsistency across all three forms of distress. \r\nIn addition to identifiable variables, one of the primary reasons for the collapse of behemoth corporations is deficiencies in internal corporate governance. Conflicts arising due to the separation of ownership and management are often addressed with an efficient internal corporate governance mechanism. Despite the ongoing debate on inconclusive evidence regarding the specific impact of individual corporate governance dimensions on financial distress, the development of a composite measure through an index can offer consistent findings. Such indexes must be set in the country\'s unique context and regulatory framework. However, the absence of such an index in the Indian context highlights the need for a study to investigate the influence of internal corporate governance quality on financial distress through a self-constructed index. Findings reveal that financially distressed firms are associated with poor internal corporate governance quality in terms of ownership structure, board composition and structure, board sub-committees, financial transparency, and disclosure. \r\nGiven the lack of internal corporate governance quality and poor financial health, distressed firms also have strong incentives to engage in earnings management to conceal their deteriorating condition. Therefore, the third objective is to explore the impact of financial distress on earnings management and examine other determinants that could lead to earnings management. The findings indicate that distressed firms tend to engage in earnings management through real earnings management. Earnings management is prevalent prior to new debt issuance but not before new equity issuance. It was also observed that the presence of institutional investors effectively constrains earnings management. Further, companies resort to real earnings management when accrual earnings management is restricted by regulation and accounting flexibility.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-01 07:33:58','Active'),(728,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL',' An Aggregated Powertrain Model and a Scaled-Down Vehicle for Advancing Autonomous Vehicle Technology ','Mr. Subhadeep Kumar (EE15D211)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Ramkrishna Pasumarthy\r\nCo-Guide: Dr. Nirav Pravinbhai Bhatt','Electrical Engineering','2024/07/04 18:30','2024-07-04','yes','Online (Googlemeet)','Contemporary research on Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) predominantly centers on electric vehicles (EVs), while a notable preference persists among end-users for Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles driven by factors such as cost and familiarity. At the same time, widespread deployment of AVs necessitates their ability to navigate diverse traffic scenarios, including dense, laneless roads shared with human-driven vehicles of varying automation levels. Conducting real-world testing under such conditions poses safety concerns for all road users. To address these challenges, this work extends the scope of AV research to encompass ICE vehicles and introduces a scaled-down platform for testing AV algorithms. We consider an electronically actuated ICE powertrain with a push belt type continuous variable transmission (CVT) associated with a double-pinion planetary gear set. The electronically controlled actuators create the opportunity to implement autonomous driving controllers. Our focus lies on developing detailed control-oriented models of vehicular systems, which is crucial for developing autonomous driving controllers. We propose a novel model for the planetary gear set as a differential-algebraic-equation (DAE) system with switching dynamics. We extend the dynamic torque converter model and combine CVT variator kinematics and dynamics of pulley motion and hydraulics to develop an aggregated model. Further, we construct data-driven models for the CVT\'s traction coefficient and equilibrium force ratio. To operate the CVT, we design a rule-based controller that makes the CVT function at discrete steady-state ratios. We combine these models with the existing models of powertrain components and vehicle dynamics to study the utility of the developed powertrain model. We consider three case study examples with realistic scenarios resembling vehicle maneuvers in traffic, stop-and-go motion, and reverse motion to examine the model\'s ability to capture transient and steady-state characteristics and compare the resulting behaviour with the expected response. The powertrain model can be integrated with models of other vehicular subsystems and vehicle motion dynamics to develop autonomous driving controllers for ICE vehicles.\r\nThereafter, we present a full vehicle model and conceptualize a scaled-down vehicle platform to validate AV algorithms where physical testing is a safety issue. We introduce a rear-wheel driven and front-wheel steered one-tenth-scale electric vehicle designed by emphasizing vehicle state measurement, precise control, perception sensing, and electric safety. Our approach utilizes actuators that provide feedback, enhanced reliability, and precision, in contrast to conventional scaled platforms built with actuators of radio-controlled cars. Apart from the conventional sensors used in the existing scaled platforms, our vehicle incorporates novel sensor modules to measure wheel angular velocities, steering angles, and battery cell voltages, which can also be adapted into the existing scaled platforms. We demonstrate the vehicle\'s motion with manual and autonomous operation and showcase its features and functionalities for validation. Overall, our research work broadens the applicability of AV technology to ICE vehicles and puts forth a platform for validating autonomous driving algorithms where real-time testing is unsuitable.\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/ahx-znpb-hhb','','',1,'2024-07-01 08:41:33','Active'),(729,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','STUDY ON EFFECT OF INLET FLOW TURBULENCE ON COMBUSTION INSTABILITY AND THERMO-ACOUSTICALLY INDUCED FLAME FLASHBACK IN A PREMIXED DUMP COMBUSTOR','Mr.Pankaj Pancharia (AE16D405)','Ph.D. Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engg.','Prof. Chakravarthy S R - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/07/03 15:00','2024-07-03','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/vhz-cney-rnc','','',1,'2024-07-01 09:34:49','Active'),(730,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Analog Optical Technologies for Generation, Transport and Sensing of mmWave Signals','Mr. Sreeraj S J (EE17D033)','Ph.

This work demonstrates the potential of microwave photonics to supersede traditional radio frequency (RF) systems, with enhanced ultra-broadband capabilities, low loss, and minimal electromagnetic interference, among other advantages. This thesis covers analytical and time-domain models of radio frequency over fiber (RFoF) links, which are described in detail and validated with available literature and experiments. An intuitive MATLAB-based application designed for the seamless design of RFoF links has been implemented. A work that proved to be of significant contribution to the experimental demonstrations in this thesis includes the development of a dither-free any-point bias controller. The algorithms that enabled precise control are discussed in sufficient detail. This is further enhanced by multichannel implementation, allowing for the simultaneous control of multiple modulators with reduced hardware requirements. Specifically, this thesis demonstrates a multi-channel IF upconversion system comprising five modulators, tailored for 5G signal transport.\r\n\r\nFurther, this thesis explores the application of analog radio over fiber for mmWave fronthaul in 5G networks. Fronthaul data rates in case of millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless systems scale up to several Gbps in the currently deployed digitized radio over fiber solutions, resulting in large complexity remote radio heads (RRHs). The thesis propose a promising solution involving optical frequency doubling and quadrupling, where all complex digital processing are moved to the centralized base band unit (BBU), thereby allowing placement of large number of low-complex RRHs at long distances. Further experimental demonstrations are discussed with optical frequency doubling and quadrupling for the generation and transport of millimeter wave mmWave signals with OFDM containing QPSK, 16/64/256-QAM modulation formats over a distance of 2 km. These schemes enable the use of low-frequency RF signals at the BBU for the generation of mmWaves at the RRH. The performance of the systems were conducted in terms of error vector magnitude (EVM) and out-of-band emissions of the upconverted data. The results show that the proposed schemes achieve EVM values within the 3GPP 5G standard requirements. We also investigate the tunability and scalability of the proposed schemes across the n258 band (24.25 - 27.5 GHz) and discuss the feasibility of implementing dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) for servicing multi-channel operation required for multisector antennas. The proposed schemes can support high data rate transmission for future wireless networks including 6G.

CALPHAD-guided predictions were validated in experimental cast alloys through X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) investigations. Furthermore, the bulk alloys were characterized by nanoindentation and bulk hardness tests to obtain their mechanical properties. Rapid Solidification Processing (RSP) technique was successful in suppressing the equilibrium D022 phase and FCC/L12 microstructure with high volume fraction of coherent L12 phase like â€œNi-based superalloysâ€ was observed for the first time in Al-based alloy systems. XRD, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirm that the duplex microstructure thus obtained is composed of Î±-Al (Î³,FCC) matrix strengthened with high-volume fraction of nanoscale coherent L12-structured Al3Â¬TM (TM= Hf, Nb, Ta, Ti, Zr) (Î³\',Ordered FCC) precipitates. \r\nHigh-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and Fast-Fourier transform (FFT) patterns further confirm the cubic structure of precipitates. High Angle Annular Dark Field Scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) imaging combined with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis and 3D-Atom Probe Tomography (APT) was used for a deeper microstructural understanding and mapping the alloy chemistry at near-atomic scale. Al-based superalloys possessed exception high-temperature mechanical properties and exceptional RT-deformability. Furthermore, the effect of cooling rate (wheel speed during RSP) on microstructure and mechanical properties was understood. An increase in NH and REM was observed on increasing the wheel rpm due to greater solute supersaturation attained at higher wheel speeds. Refined Î³\' phase with higher volume fraction at higher wheel speeds is also responsible for significant precipitation strengthening. High-temperature phase stability investigations revealed exceptional retention in mechanical properties owing to exceptional thermal stability. In addition, HT oxidation tests revealed superior oxidation resistance. This study leads to the birth of new class of advanced Al-based alloys which can open new possibilities for the development of advanced light-weight alloys for critical industries. \r\n','Benny J','mmoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/xvu-riix-ikh','','',1,'2024-07-01 10:16:19','Active'),(733,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Design and Analysis of High Gain DC-DC Converter For DC Microgrid Applications','Ms. LEELAVATHI E (EE19S028)','MS Scholar','Guide: Dr. K.

Achieving high-quality photon sources and high-extinction pump rejection filters is crucial for advancing large-scale quantum photonic signal processing in silicon. However, current performance limitations of these photon sources and filters hinder the scalability of photonic circuits. This thesis focuses on enhancing the figure of merit for both devices, addressing challenges in correlated photon pair generation through spontaneous four-wave mixing in a microring resonator and demonstrating pump rejection filters with distributed Bragg gratings.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInitially, stimulated four-wave mixing in a silicon photonic wire showed an idler-to-signal conversion efficiency of approximately -35 dB for a launched pump power of 15 dBm. Improved conversion efficiency was achieved using a microring resonator with a radius of 20 Î¼m (Q > 50,000). A properly designed asymmetric bus-ring waveguide coupler improved the spectral purity of heralded single photons from 93% to ~99% at resonant wavelengths around 1550 nm. For pump rejection, a single-stage distributed Bragg grating in a multimode rib waveguide exhibited a stopband extinction of ~65 dB. On-chip stimulated four-wave mixing experiments validated the pump rejection efficiency, attenuating the pump laser to the idler power level.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIntegrating the filter with a microring resonator, we reported bistable generation of entangled photon pairs via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a silicon microring resonator integrated with a pump rejection filter (>45 dB). The observed photon generation rate exceeded 20 MHz in one bistable state for a launched input power of ~0.75 mW in the C-band. This integration reduces the need for external filters before single-photon detectors. Furthermore, the grating-based filter design for pump rejection was extended to the silicon nitride waveguide platform, demonstrating four-wave mixing and on-chip pump suppression capabilities up to 65 dB.\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/twa-krwr-kbk','','',1,'2024-07-01 10:30:18','Active'),(735,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Geometric methods for control, consensus and synchronization in Lie groups','Mr. Rama Seshan Chandra Sekaran  (EE17D402)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Arunkumar D Mahindrakar\r\nCo-Guide: Dr. Ravi N Banavar (IITB)','Electrical Engineering','2024/07/08 10:00','2024-07-08','yes','Online (Googlemeet)','Most mechanical systems encountered in real world applications are interconnections of rigid bodies and hence their configuration spaces are Lie groups.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is used widely for analysing dielectric relaxations in polymeric materials, especially interactions with various molecules such as, solvents, plasticisers and other additives. However, it has been rarely used for gas detection in polymers. CO2 can diffuse through polymers as well as undergo physical adsorption or chemical absorption. These are normally facilitated by modifying polymers both physically and chemically.

However, existing encoder-decoder-based networks have a few shortcomings: (1) They focus on the anatomy structure at the expense of fine details, hindering their performance in generating faithful reconstructions; (2) Lack of long-range dependencies yields sub-optimal recovery of fine structural details. In this work, we propose an Over-Complete Under-Complete Transformer network (OCUCFormer) which focuses on better capturing fine edges and details in the image and can extract the long range relations between these features for improved single-coil (SC) and multi-coil (MC) MRI reconstruction.\r\n \r\nOur model computes long-range relations in the highest resolutions using Restormer modules for improved acquisition and restoration of fine anatomical details. Towards learning in the absence of fully sampled ground truth for supervision, we show that our model trained with under-sampled data in a self-supervised fashion shows a superior recovery of fine structures compared to other works.\r\n \r\nWe have extensively evaluated our network for SC and MC MRI reconstruction on brain, cardiac, and knee anatomies for 4Ã— and 5Ã— acceleration factors.

In thin liquid films, surface tension gradients can be generated by local heating or cooling, which could cause fluid convection. In this study, it is aimed to systematically examine surface tension-driven instability in the form of Marangoni plumes emerging from the bottom of a heated vertical soap film. The spacing between these plumes would provide critical insights into the near-wall physics of turbulent convection.\r\n\r\nSoap films, made from solutions of different surface tension and viscosity, are confined into a copper wire frame, whose lower end is brought into contact with a heated liquid reservoir. The resultant emergence of plumes are visualized using shadowgraphy technique. The spacing between successive plumes (Î») was measured for Rayleigh numbers (Ra) ranging from 10^3 to 10^5. The near-wall dynamics reveal that plumes initiate at certain points, elongate, and eventually merge. An increase in Rayleigh number leads to a greater number of closely and regularly spaced plumes. The plume formation is characterized by an initial transient state with exponential variation in plume spacing over time, followed by a steady-state phase of invariance in plume spacing. It is shown that the plume spacing in both steady and transient stages vary as Ra^(-1/3). The instability is understood in terms of the balance between buoyancy, viscous, and Marangoni forces.','Sreeram K.

We first present the experimentally obtained plume structures at high Rayleigh numbers  (RaH ~ 1010) and Schmidt numbers (Sc ~ 675), in convection driven by density differences  across a horizontal membrane when vertical transpiration velocities in the range of 0.002 cm/s â‰¤ Vo â‰¤ 0.065 cm/s are imposed. The density differences across the membrane are created by having brine with higher concentrations above the membrane and ammonium chloride with lower concentrations below it, with the bottom fluid being forced upward across the membrane by gravitational heads to create transpiration. Planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) visualisations in a horizontal plane grazing the top of the membrane, with refractive index matching, brings out the plume structures and their evolution with RaH and Vo. The plume structures show complex dendritic patterns of line plumes with plume-free patches; the plume-free patches decrease in area and number, with decrease in RaH and Vo . At low Vo , these plume-free patches have aligned plumes around them, while at larger Vo, such aligned plumes are not seen. These patches are expected to be due to the impingement of large scale flow at low Vo, while they could be due to the modification of boundary layer instability at large Vo. These plumes become closer with increase in RaH , while they become more separated with increase in Vo. This variation is quantified by measuring the total plume length (Lp) by skeletonising the plume structures and calculating the mean plume spacing (Î») from Lp; Î» show non-trivial, non-power law dependence on RaH  and Vo, different from those observed for the case of no-through flow and low-through flows by earlier researchers.  \r\nComputational studies on a minimal flow unit near the membrane, namely a pair of line plumes, with the boundary layer and the bulk flow in between them, were conducted for temperature driven convection, with wall normal flow. The concentration gradient driven experiments were analogous to the temperature driven numerical simulation, by replacing Sc with Pr, Î”C with Î”T, D with Î± and Î² with Î²T. The plume velocity, the thickness of thermal boundary layer and critical plume spacing were found to increase with increase in wall normal velocity. The numerically obtained averaged dimensionless temperature profile of thermal boundary layer is shown to match the analytical relation for the species boundary layer proposed by Ramareddy et al. (2020). \r\n The average diffusive heat flux (NuD/L) decreased with increase in dimensionless wall normal velocity J in the form. In contrast; the average total heat flux (NuT/L) increased with increase in dimensionless the wall normal velocity. The average total heat flux exhibited a 1/3 power law dependence on J (Nu ~ J1/3), this is analogous to the Nu ~ RaH 1/3 scaling in the absence of vertical wall normal flow in turbulence RBC. \r\n A theoretical scaling is proposed to predict the variation in the plume spacing with throughflow using Neilds stability condition at low Peclet number. The experimentally obtained values of mean plume spacing and numerically obtained results for critical plume spacings are shown to match with this theoretical scaling, over a wide range (10-10 to 10-1) of dimensionless throughflow velocities (J).   \r\n','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline meeting Link: https://meet.google.com/fae-cjij-pdc','','',1,'2024-07-01 11:39:55','Active'),(742,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','AIR POLLUTION HOTSPOT MANAGEMENT USING IMAGE PROCESSING AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES','Mr. Aswin Giri J, Roll No: CE19D039','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. S M Shiva Nagendra - Guide, Dr. Gitakrishnan Ramadurai - DC Member, Dr. Chandan Sarangi - DC Member, Dr. B S V Prasad Patnaik, AM - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/07/04 14:00','2024-07-04','yes','Conference Room (BSB 104)','','Manikandan R, CE Office','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-01 11:41:05','Active'),(743,'','Special Talk',NULL,'Scientific Research & Knowledge in the AI & fake news era',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'How does AI shape science and knowledge?

Here biogas is homogeneously pre-mixed with\r\nair and compressed while a small amount of diesel is injected directly at an appropriate\r\nearly timing (between 50 to 90Â° bTDC) during compression. The proportion of these\r\nfuels and the injection timing of the diesel control the reactivity and homogeneity for\r\ncombustion to be optimized Use of conventional Wide spray angle Injectors (WI) for\r\nthe early injection of diesel in RCCI engines results in its impingement on the cylinder\r\nwall leading to poor mixture preparation, dilution of the lubricating oil, soot, unburned\r\nhydrocarbon (HC) emissions and low efficiency. Narrow spray angle Injectors (NI) can\r\navoid this problem. However, biogas diesel RCCI engines will also require a late diesel\r\ninjection near TDC for proper combustion control using a WI.\r\nIn the first phase of this work a twin injector concept for utilizing biogas in the\r\nRCCI mode along with diesel was developed through CFD studies and experiments.\r\nAn additional common rail injector with a narrow angle between the sprays (NI) was\r\nspecially developed and employed for the early injection of diesel, while the\r\nconventional WI was used for injections near TDC. A turbocharged two cylinder\r\ncommon rail diesel engine was modified with two diesel fuel rails and a special open\r\nengine control software and hardware. CFD studies helped design the angle and\r\norientation of the sprays of the NI and ranges of injection timings and diesel quantities.\r\nExperiments were then conducted in the combined Narrow Wide RCCI (NW RCCI) mode and the results were compared with that of the Wide only RCCI (WI RCCI) and\r\nthe Conventional Dual Fuel (CDF) mode at BMEPs of 3 bar, 5 bar and 7 bar. NW RCCI\r\nmode resulted in very high efficiency and low NOx in the above range. The most\r\nsuitable injection pressure was 640 bar, start of injection of the NI was 900 bTDC and\r\nthe injection duration of NI was 275 Î¼s for best overall performance. The most suitable\r\nrange of injection timings and biogas shares were identified for different biogas shares\r\nand BMEPs.\r\nIn order to extend the BMEP range of RCCI operation, a combustion mode\r\nswitching concept was developed. Here a special master slave control strategy was\r\nconceptualized, implemented and demonstrated on an in-house developed control\r\nsystem. This enabled switching between CDC (conventional Diesel Combustion),\r\nbiogas diesel CDF and biogas diesel NW RCCI modes seamlessly depending on the\r\nload conditions while maximizing biogas utilization. Stability of the load, actual load\r\nand rate of change of load were used as the criteria while speed was also governed\r\nsimultaneously.\r\nIn the next phase a method of utilizing biogas in the RCCI mode along with another\r\nrenewable fuel of high reactivity namely Dimethyl Ether (DME) was developed. The\r\npossibility of utilizing biogas itself to produce DME makes this option relevant.\r\nExperimental studies at BMEPs of 3 bar and 5 bar proved that this mode of operation\r\ncan tolerate variations in the composition of biogas with higher BTE, very low NOx\r\nand soot. At a BMEP of 3 bar this method of operation referred to as DMB-RCCI gave\r\nnear zero NOx while that of Diesel Biogas Conventional Dual Fuel (DIB-CDF) and\r\nNW RCCI were 6.6 g/kWh and 0.9 g/kWh respectively. Similar was the case with soot\r\nwhere ultra-low values were obtained in the case of DMB-RCCI against the high value of 0.265 FSN obtained in the case of NW RCCI. The DIB-CDF mode also produced\r\nvery low soot. In the case of the BMEP of 5 bar, the same trend was observed.\r\nOn the whole, the experiments and simulation studies revealed the benefits of\r\nthe biogas diesel NW RCCI concept (in terms of high efficiency and low NOx\r\nemissions) developed in this work that mitigated the cylinder wall wetting problem.\r\nThe control methodology that was realized and demonstrated was capable of switching\r\nmodes between NW RCCI, CDF and CDC in real time and in a seamless manner for\r\nextending the BMEP range. Finally it was demonstrated through experiments that DME\r\nwhich is a renewable fuel can be used to enhance the reactivity of biogas in the RCCI\r\nmode with ultra-low NOx, soot, high thermal efficiency and low THC and CH4\r\nemissions for decentralized power generation.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','KEYWORDS: RCCI, Twin injector CI engine, Diesel-biogas RCCI, DME-biogas RCCI, Mode switching engines','','',1,'2024-07-01 16:24:21','Active'),(746,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','Art of Scientific Illustration','Megha Ramachandra','Megha Ramachandra is a Technical Illustrator with Bachelors from Azim Premji University.

It has gained even more relevance\r\nin view of the global effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Safety in such systems is\r\nparamount, as any nuclear accident has the potential for an enormous environmental\r\nimpact. Fast reactors are high energy density systems requiring a very efficient heat\r\ntransport medium. Most fast reactors worldwide use liquid metal (sodium) as coolant\r\nowing to its high thermal conductivity and high heat transfer coefficient within nuclear\r\nfuel subassemblies. Fuel and structural materials can melt during a severe accident in\r\na fast reactor (called a hypothetical core disruptive accident due to its extremely low\r\nprobability). This mixture of materials called corium forms at very high temperatures\r\n( 2800â—¦C) and travels towards the bottom regions of the reactor vessel under gravity.\r\nAs part of mitigation measures it must be ensured that the main reactor vessel is not\r\nbreached. Towards this a dedicated structure called the core catcher is placed over the\r\nmain reactor vessel. The core catcher contains all the corium, ensures coolability and\r\nprevents recriticality. The present work is a small step towards the resolution of the\r\nrelocation process of the molten corium from the bottom of the core to the core catcher.\r\nMolten corium travels through a long column of coolant sodium. Essentially,\r\nmultiple complex phenomena would co-exist such as two-phase flow, solidification of\r\ncorium, boiling of sodium, setting up of thermal stresses in solidified corium drops\r\nand heat generation in corium drops due to radioactive decay. The settling behaviour\r\nover the core catcher is a critical parameter required to be resolved in order to ensure\r\neffective mitigation strategies. The first part of the transient is expected to be influenced primarily by two-phase flow instabilities. Two-phase flow instabilities will lead to the\r\nbreakup of the corium jet into smaller droplets. This phase is expected to have the\r\nmost significant influence on the settling behaviour of corium on the core catcher. This\r\nforms the main focus of the present work. Multi-phase flows with moving interfaces, in\r\ngeneral, lie at the heart of several important physical and industrial processes and are\r\nchallenging to solve due to the inherent complex physics involved. A robust and accurate\r\ntwo-phase flow solver based on the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method has been developed\r\n(THYC-MP) to capture the physics of initial corium movement in sodium. The present\r\nimplementation is limited to two-dimensional orthogonal and non-uniform grids. The\r\nVOF method is used due to its advantages with respect to stringent mass conservation\r\nof each phase. Each significant step, viz. interface reconstruction, interface advection\r\nand curvature calculation, has been looked at critically and important improvements\r\nhave been devised. A new class of interface reconstruction methods, the Piecewise\r\nCircular Interface Construction (PCIC) method, has been proposed. The method uses a\r\npiecewise circular reconstruction of a two-phase interface and is shown to be significantly\r\nmore accurate than the standard Piecewise Linear methods (PLIC) and is comparable\r\nto existing higher-order methods. The accuracy and order of convergence are shown\r\nusing randomised reconstruction of standard shapes chosen from the literature. The\r\nmethod also is simpler to implement than many higher-order methods. It achieves\r\nhigh accuracy by implementing a c0-correction on an optimised base piecewise circular\r\ninterface obtained using circular fit methods.\r\n\r\nThe highly accurate edge-matched flux polygon advection (EMFPA) method has\r\nbeen implemented for interface advection. The version implemented here is a highly\r\nefficient one that calculates the vertices of the flux polygon from analytical relations. A\r\nfractional stepping based template to improve accuracy of unsplit geometric advection\r\nmethods has been proposed. With the help of dynamic interface reconstruction problems,\r\n\r\nviz. vortex in a box and the four vortex problem, the superior accuracy of the PCIC-\r\nEMFPA combination is shown. Further, the curvature calculation is based on a variable stencil-based Height Function (HF) method. A hybrid method taking advantage of the\r\naccuracy of reconstruction of the PCIC method and curvature calculation of the Height\r\nFunction method is devised. Towards this, a general template for improving the PLIC\r\ninterface itself has been proposed. This step allows the successful blending of the PCIC\r\nand HF methods. All the improvements proposed as part of the present work have been\r\nbrought together within the framework of a force-balanced projection-based two-phase\r\nflow solver. The formulation is fully implicit. A preconditioned biconjugate gradient\r\n(stabilised) method is used to solve the implicit equations. The whole implementation is\r\ndone using MATLAB scripting. Several two-phase flow problems with complex physics\r\nfrom the literature have been used to validate the present implementation.\r\n\r\nFinally, the movement of molten corium in sodium and a simulant system, i.e.\r\nWoodâ€™s metal in water, have been studied. As part of a separate development solver for\r\nsimulating phase change problems (solidification/melting) based on the Enthalpy-porosity\r\napproach has been developed. The solver is not only capable of tracking the melt interface\r\nbut, at the same time, resolves buoyancy-driven flow with the molten material. The\r\ndevelopments proposed as part of the present work will acts as pre-cursors to further\r\ndevelopments imbibing additional physics in the future.

The rate of failures associated with\r\nthe wind turbines is expected to escalate with the increase in installation rate\r\ncorrespondingly. Therefore, searching for solutions for the current challenges in wind\r\nenergy electricity production is essential. In wind turbines, the majority of failures are\r\ndue to wind turbine gearbox (WTG) breakdowns. Despite advanced design practices,\r\ngearbox failures are found in critical bearing locations. The premature bearing failures\r\nassociated with WTG bearings and the drive train components reduce the life span of\r\nthe wind turbine and increase the cost per unit of energy. A prevalent trigger for these\r\npremature bearing failures in the WTG is the presence of white etching areas (WEAs)\r\nand white etching cracks (WECs). The formation of WEAs and WECs further leads to\r\nwhite structure flaking (WSF) and axial cracking bearing components. This mode of\r\naggressive failure lessens the lifetime of WTG to less than two years from the designed\r\nlife expectancy of 20 -25 years. The WECs failure is predominantly formed due to the\r\ntransient operating environment of WTG bearings at the surface and subsurface\r\nheterogeneities of the bearing steel. Extensive root cause assessment of failed bearings\r\nidentified two predominant driving forces: 1) Mechanical stress-induced and 2)\r\nHydrogen-enhanced premature bearing failure. For the past several decades,\r\nresearchers, design engineers, and lubrication engineers have collectively worked\r\ntowards enhancing the performance of WTGs, reducing downtime, and overall bringing down the unit price of energy as much as possible. However, the attempts did not result\r\nin a significant improvement in the WTG-bearing life.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to mitigate the formation of WEAs in the bearing steel using\r\nalternative material, suitable surface coating and base oil selection. AISI 52100 is one\r\nof the most commonly used bearing steels in the wind turbine industry for the\r\nproduction of rolling element bearings. The WEAs replication tests were carried out in\r\na dynamic load Pin-on-Disc (PoD) tribometer, which can provide severe cyclic\r\ncompressive stress and pure slide throughout the operation. The dynamic PoD is\r\ndesigned to accelerate WEAs formation in the bearing ball subsurface. The loading\r\nfrequency is fixed at 4.5 Hz for the WEAs replication tests discussed in this thesis. This\r\nresearch evaluated the feasibility of AISI 440C stainless steel as an alternative bearing\r\nmaterial against WEAs formation using polyalphaolefin (PAO) base stock oil. The\r\ncomprehensive analysis of materials and lubricants revealed that the performance of\r\nAISI 440C stainless steel increased WEAs formation time to 0.42 million cycles from\r\n0.21 million loading cycles of AISI 52100 bearing steel. Further, this work investigated\r\nthe performance of mineral oil (heavy paraffin oil) and synthetic poly alkyl glycol\r\n(PAG) against the WEAs formation under pure sliding with cyclic compressive loading.\r\nThe performance of lubricants was evaluated using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)\r\nand electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The outcomes reveal that the free\r\nradical formation rate is higher for paraffin than PAG. The WEAs formation in the\r\nbearing steel is delayed in the PAG-tested samples compared to paraffin oil. However,\r\nat higher contact pressures, the use of PAG does not significantly improve WEA\r\nformation time compared to the reference oil (PAO). Therefore, the mitigation strategies were extended to the surface modification methods, such as DLC-based\r\ncoating, to delay the formation of WEAs in the bearing subsurface.\r\n\r\nThe performance of hydrogenated diamond-like-carbon (DLC) coating against WEAs\r\nformation was evaluated under sliding-dynamic conditions. The bearing ball samples\r\nwere first coated with Cr/CrN and W interlayer using the physical vapour deposition\r\n(PVD) technique. Subsequently, hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) DLC using\r\nthe plasma-assisted chemical vapour deposition (PACVD) method. The dynamic\r\nloading experiments were carried out in the dynamic load PoD tribometer with PAO\r\nunder a boundary lubrication regime. Prior to the dynamic load tests, detailed surface\r\nand tribological characterisation of the deposited DLC coating was carried out. The\r\npost-WEAs replication test analysis results were compared with the uncoated AISI\r\n52100 bearing steel tribopair to evaluate the performance of DLC-coated bearing steel\r\nagainst WEAs formation under given conditions. The results obtained show the\r\ncapability of the proposed coating to delay the formation of WEAs in the bearing steel\r\nthan that of the uncoated sample. The WEAs inception was observed in the uncoated\r\nAISI 52100 bearing samples after 0.21 million cycles, whereas WEAs were observed\r\nin the DLC-coated bearing ball samples after 1 million loading cycles. The DLC coating\r\non the bearing steel surface retards the WEAs formation in three ways. (i) The wear\r\nrate of the coated sample is minimised because of the superior wear resistance\r\ncharacteristic, which reduces the lubricant degradation and hydrogen ingression. (ii)\r\nThe inbuilt hydrogen barrier properties of DLC coating suppress the amount of atomic\r\nhydrogen that enters the bearing steel subsurface. (iii) The coating reduces the\r\ninterfacial friction and thus reduces the accumulation of slip energy. Further, this study\r\nassessed the performance of base oils with various lubricant chemistry against microstructural decay in DLC-coated AISI 52100 bearing steel. Mineral, polyethylene\r\nglycol (PEG) and PAO oils were chosen for the study. The effect of base oils against\r\nWEAs formation in DLC-coated steel is explored by analysing the condition of oils,\r\nwear behaviour, and subsurface microstructural change. The wear rate, free radical\r\ngeneration, and water concentration were highest for the PEG samples. Besides that,\r\ncarbon film formation on the contact surfaces was delayed in the PEG-tested samples\r\ncompared to the mineral oil-tested samples. The findings from the wear and lubricant\r\nanalyses explain the accelerated formation of WEAs in PEG-tested samples under the\r\ngiven test conditions. WEAs formation propensity is higher for PEG-tested samples\r\ncompared to mineral oil. In contrast, WEAs formation is not observed in PAO-tested\r\nsamples under given test conditions.\r\n\r\nThus, with proper surface coating and base oil selection, the WEAs inception time in\r\nbearing steel can be significantly increased. Overall, under realistic conditions, it would\r\nreduce the failure rate of WTG bearings while also lowering the cost per unit of energy\r\nand helping in wind energy market expansion.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','Keywords: Diamond-like carbon coating, dynamic loading, hydrogen ingression, lubricant degradation, ','','',1,'2024-07-02 01:45:53','Active'),(749,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Fast Simulation Techniques for Sub-Continuum Transport','Prof. Jayathi Y.

The presence of nanofibers can enhance the filtration efficiency of particles in the range of most penetrating particle size (MPPS). It can achieve a minimal pressure drop due to the slip effect at the surface of the nanofibers. The heterogeneities in the filter structure lead to drastic changes in the filter media performance, affecting the gas flow path and particle behaviour. An attempt was made to model nanofibrous filter media based on Nylon 6,6 in a relatively straightforward 2-D array model to evaluate the performance. The filter media heterogeneities are captured by the detailed representation of fiber size distribution which involves a thorough statistical analysis. An algorithm based on a random approach was developed to create the representative geometry of nanofibrous filter media by analyzing the nanolayer and base media separately. The Eulerian-Lagrangian CFD approach was used to model the gas-particle flow through nanofibrous filter media, incorporating the relevant particle filtration mechanisms for the desired particle flow conditions. \r\n\r\nA similar approach was used to model composite nanofibrous filter media (CNT-Nylon 6,6), which aims to understand the effect of CNT on the performance of nanofibrous filters. As a general trend, the average fiber diameter of the nanolayer prepared by electrospinning was reduced by the addition of CNT. By varying the CNT concentration, we could identify that the composite filter media prepared by adding an optimum CNT concentration of 1 wt % has the maximum quality factor, based on the numerical and experimental study. The numerical model provides possibilities for further investigations in studying nanofibrous filter media. Optimization studies based on the Design of Experiments (DoE) were conducted to identify the best combination of nano-coating layer parameters like thickness, fiber volume fraction, and the fiber size distribution of the nanolayer for a better-performing nanofibrous filter media.\r\n','HoD Office','apoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/qcv-qqsn-skw','','',1,'2024-07-02 04:19:17','Active'),(751,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- அடுத்த, அடுத்தது (aduttha, adutthathu)\r\nHindi word	- अगला (agalaa)\r\nEnglish word	- Next','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-02 04:20:12','default_value'),(752,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Fast Simulation Techniques for Sub-Continuum Transport','Prof. Jayathi Y.

Given a graph G, the algorithmic task is to assign a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The minimum number of colors used to perform this task is called the chromatic number of the graph. Where it is trivial to color the graph with n colors, it is NP-Hard to find the chromatic number of a graph. And the decision problem of determining whether for a given k, a graph G admits a k coloring is NP-Complete.\r\n\r\nClassical models and algorithms assume the ability to read the entire input and produce the entire output. However, for extremely large inputs, such as graphs with millions or billions of nodes, this becomes impractical due to excessive time and space requirements which makes it impractical for a single processor to process. Such situations can be dealt with, alternative computation models such as parallel and distributed models of computing, or requiring that the output is only approximate or other weaker guarantees. In this work we study, Local Computation Algorithms (LCAs). LCAs only read a small portion of the input and produce a small portion of the output. For instance, for graph coloring problem, given a vertex query in a graph, an LCA will read a limited number of vertices and output the color of the queried vertex according to a specific coloring scheme.\r\n\r\n In this study, we look into weaker notions of coloring. One such notion is weak coloring, where all vertices needs at least a minimum number of neighbors to be of different colors, and other notion is partial coloring, where a large fraction of vertices will have all their neighbors of different colors and a combination of weak and partial colorings. A graph is Î±-partially colored if at least (1 âˆ’ Î±) fraction of vertices have all their neighbors of different colors, and a graph is weakly 2-colored if each vertex is colored with one of the two given colors and has a neighbor of different color. We have developed LCAs, that needs time sublinear in input size for weak 2-coloring problem, and takes constant time for Î±-partial weak 2-coloring problem for bounded maximum degree graphs. Also we have developed LCAs that take constant time for weak 2-coloring and Î±-partial coloring of hyperfinite graphs.','Yadu Vasudev','yadu@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-02 05:22:46','Active'),(754,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Ph.D Seminar Talk - II - Thermodynamically Consistent 3D Plastic Constitutive Relation For Cyclic Response of Metals','Mr. Manimaran L, Roll No. CE17D021','Ph.D Research Scholar','Dr. U.

The traditional plastic strain is abandoned and instead, the replacement stress is used to parametrize a constitutive relation involving Hencky strain and Cauchy stress. A stressed reference configuration is involved in contrast to the traditional approach, and the framework demonstrates that an implicit constitutive relation is indispensable to capture the inelastic cyclic response. The conventional entropy inequality is converted into an equality by incorporating a continuous, non-negative dissipation rate function, which represents the rate at which energy is dissipated. The evolution equation for the replacement stress is derived to ensure that the process that maximizes energy dissipation occurs, leading to the fastest possible achievement of thermodynamic equilibrium. For the dissipation function and a Gibbs-like potential appropriate constitutive prescriptions are made and responses of steel, aluminium, titanium compared with experimental uniaxial response. Transverse strain vs. uniaxial strain behaviour differs between present formulation and classical plasticity. The proposed formulation predicts a compressible response during plastic deformations in accord with some experimental observations. Appropriate response is captured corresponding to a fixed biaxial stress state. The difference between stress-controlled and strain-controlled response is illustrated.','R.

As the MAS is networked, an agent has access only to the state information of its neighbors, also referred to as local or output feedback information structure. As a consequence, full-state feedback controllers are not implementable. Using a game-theoretic framework, we model the distributed control problem as a networked differential game. Existing research works assume complete state information, which is not feasible in practical scenarios, and the local state information or outputs are available when agents are networked. We illustrate that, even for low-dimensional problems, computing an output feedback Nash equilibrium (OFNE) is difficult. In particular, finding an OFNE is related to solving coupled algebraic Riccati equations (CARE). However, solving CARE becomes complicated as the number of players increases. Even though iterative methods exist to solve CARE, their efficacy depends on proper initialization, and their convergence is not guaranteed. As a result, the existence of an OFNE is not verifiable due to the structural constraints induced by the network topology. To address this, we develop the notion of output feedback guaranteed cost equilibrium (GCE). The output feedback GCE controllers achieve a given upper bound on the individual cost of agents while retaining an equilibrium property. We derive several properties associated with a GCE. In particular, we show that the set of GCE controllers is monotone with respect to the cost profile. We also derive a uniform price of stability bound associated with a set of GCE. We provide sufficient conditions for the verification of GCE given cost and strategy profiles of the players. Further, we also derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a guaranteed cost response. We formulate linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based conditions for the existence of these equilibria and an algorithm for synthesizing them.\r\n\r\nNext, we focus on the control of MAS under the effect of an external deterministic disturbance signal. Despite the significance of robustness in control theory, there is a lack of research on differential games that are influenced by uncertainties or disturbances. We introduce the concept of soft-constrained output feedback guaranteed cost equilibrium (SCOGCE) assuming the external disturbances are quadratically bounded. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of SCOGCE controllers and an iterative LMI-based algorithm for synthesizing them.\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/diw-tizy-rvm','','',1,'2024-07-02 06:42:21','Active'),(757,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL',' â€œORGANOCATALYZED ENANTIOSELECTIVE DOMINO AND ONE-POT SYNTHESIS OF HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS USING FORMAL 1,3-DIPOLAR CYCLOADDITIONâ€','Mr. Pandidurai S (CY18D012)-reg','Ph.

In the first part of our work, we present a mathematical and computational analysis to estimate protein friction, which constrains the  speed and efficiency of motor proteins.

Concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies are widely used to\r\nharness solar power. One such CSP technology is the parabolic dish collector (PDC), a\r\npoint-focused and matured system for power generation and process heating\r\napplications. The solar rays are focused after reflection off a reflective surface onto the\r\nreceiver used in the PDC system at its focal zone, providing uniformly distributed heat\r\nflux over a larger surface rather than the peak flux at one point. In a PDC system, solar\r\nradiation focuses on the absorber, where heat losses occur from the receiver due to high\r\ntemperature and wind. This factor greatly influences the thermal efficiency of the\r\nsystem. The first problem discussed is lowering heat loss, essential to effectively\r\nutilizing solar energy and boosting the system\'s performance. Cavity receivers are most\r\npreferred for PDC systems to minimize heat losses. The first conical-shaped receiver\r\nhas been considered for analysis, evaluating heat loss for different tilts of the receiver\r\nunder varying wind speeds and directions, and later, the hetero-conical receiver in\r\nsubsequent studies.\r\n\r\nThe second problem discussed is to develop the integrated optical-thermal model to\r\nsimulate the wind around the PDC system with receivers and evaluate the collector\'s\r\noptical and thermal efficiencies. The sun shape and surface errors are considered for the\r\nsolar parabolic dish to build an accurate optical model using Monte-Carlo ray tracing. The user-defined sun shape and surface error of 3 mrad are adopted. The optical\r\nefficiency is 86.87% and 84.15% for conical and hetero-conical receivers, respectively.\r\nLater, the concentrated heat flux obtained from the optical model is used in thermal\r\nanalysis to build the integrated model using the user-defined function. Therminol 66, as\r\nheat transfer fluid, and air as immediate surroundings, are two fluids considered in\r\nthermal investigations. The influential parameters are tilt angles, wind speeds, wind\r\ndirections, and inlet temperatures, which are to be considered for both the receivers and\r\nthe parabolic dish in the model. The thermal performances of 69.23% and 73.11% are\r\nthe maximum for the parabolic dish collectors with conical and hetero-conical\r\nreceivers, respectively. Next, a deep learning approach is implemented to evaluate\r\nthermal performance under input conditions. The different activation functions are\r\ncompared, and the exponential linear unit (ELU) is chosen as the best activation\r\nfunction in the study. The experimental investigation is also performed for the\r\nsimplified receiver model and validated with a numerical model in subsequent analyses.\r\n\r\nFurther, energy storage is a significant challenge that comes with CSP technologies.\r\nThe phase change material-based thermal energy storage (TES) system is adopted for\r\nlow-temperature applications. The least effectiveness of 0.8 has been opted for design\r\noptimization for effective heat exchange between heat transfer fluid and phase change\r\nmaterial in the TES system. The effect of geometrical and operating parameters,\r\nincluding tube diameter, length, initial temperature, inlet temperature, and volumetric\r\nflow rate, are considered and evaluated for the effective storage capacity and\r\nperformance of the TES system. The thesis presents a holistic approach using integrated\r\noptical-thermal analysis of the PDC system and modeling of the TES systems, which\r\nwill help design and optimize the systems for solar energy conversion and storage for\r\nprocess heating applications.

These features surpass the capabilities of single-material compositions. When multiple materials are used with sharp interfaces, failure often occurs at the interfaces due to the presence of sharp stress concentration gradients under service loading conditions. Failure can be delayed if the multi-material compositions across the interface can be varied smoothly. To prevent this, functionally graded materials with diffuse interfaces can be employed. Functionally graded materials (FGM) possess preferred spatial variation of properties aligned in specific directions. However, producing complex FGM components through conventional methods is challenging, as the conventional manufacturing methods are part and tool-specific. Components made using additive manufacturing, such as powder bed fusion (PBF), can create FGM with intricate geometric features and precision at the micron scale. This opens up new avenues for innovative design possibilities with FGM components. The methodologies developed to create FGM by PBF are still in their infancy and require further attention to realize defect-free components. By employing high-fidelity mathematical models, new methodologies can be developed and minimize expensive trial-and-error experimental development strategies. The discrete element method (DEM) is a suitable numerical approach for modelling discontinuous media, such as powder particles in PBF. In this study, a spreading procedure in a powder bed fusion process is developed so that the desired distribution of material composition can be obtained before laser melting. A partition-based approach is adapted to achieve functional gradation along the spreading direction. The role of recoater speed on the evolution of the distribution of the material was studied through a parameter called gradation index (GI). A unique experimental setup was developed to analyze the prediction of the developed model. Results show that an angular partition at the dispenser can generate a customized functionally graded spreading in the build platform, and the obtained graded spreading is found to vary as a function of the recoater speed, partition angle, and spread layer thickness. In addition, the effect of gradation with different recoater profiles has been thoroughly studied. The developed methodology was used to generate FGM components in LPBF with diffused interfaces of IN718 and 17-4-PH stainless steel in various sizes of FGM.\r\n\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/uqk-xddt-dsr','','',1,'2024-07-02 14:09:11','Active'),(766,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Experimental Study on Calibration of Particle/Droplet Image Analysis (PDIA) Technique and its Application in Urea Water Solution (UWS) Injection in Hot Cross Flow','Mr. Senthil Kumar P, Roll No. ME12D016','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide - Prof. Shamit Bakshi, ME, IITM / Co-Guide - Prof. Anand T N C, IIT Palakkad','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/07/03 12:00','2024-07-03','yes','Through Google Meet Link: https://meet.google.com/wum-dedv-ehy','The key objective of this work was to examine Urea-Water Solution (UWS) sprays,\r\nwhich are formed by injecting the liquid into a hot air cross-flow in a pulsed and\r\ncontinuous mode.\r\nThe pulsed-shadowgraph method was employed to photograph the spray structure;\r\nParticle/Droplet Image Analysis (PDIA) was used to estimate droplet sizes; and Particle\r\nTracking Velocimetry (PTV) was used to calculate droplet velocities.

In this study, we present a methodology to synthesize rhombohedral (3R) phase MoS2 in well-defined sword-like geometry, exhibiting lengths of up to 120 Âµm, uniform widths ranging from 2-3 Âµm, and thicknesses of 3-7 nm by precisely controlling the dynamics of carrier gas flow from continuous mode to pulsed mode during the CVD growth process. To validate the formation of the 3R phase material, we investigate its characteristic signatures. The resulting MoS2 exhibits a high degree of circular dichroism (~58% at 100 K), accompanied by a distinctive evolution of low-frequency Raman peaks and an increasing intensity of second harmonic signals with increasing number of layers. These findings conclusively establish the presence of the 3R phase in the material. A field effect mobility of 40 cm2/V-s and I_ON/I_OFF ratio of ~106 further confirm the electronic grade standard of this 3R phase MoS2. \r\nIn addition, using polarization resolved photoluminescence measurements under linearly polarized excitations, we demonstrate the coherent superposition of the valley photons (known as valley coherence) in synthetic 3R phase MoS2 with different number of layers ranging from 3 layers to 11 layers. With near-resonant excitation, degree of linear polarization (a measure of the valley quantum coherence) is observed up to 70% at 80 K and is found to be layer thickness independent. Robust valley quantum coherence is attributed to the high optical quality and the 3R crystal symmetry of the MoS2. These findings hold significant promise for the advancement of emerging quantum electronic devices, valley-based physics and nonlinear optical phenomena in layered materials.\r\n','HoD Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/ryp-naok-ygp','','',1,'2024-07-03 05:14:28','Active'),(768,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- மேலாண்மை (melaanmai)\r\nHindi word	- प्रबंधन (prabandhan)\r\nEnglish word	- Management\r\n','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-03 05:20:37','default_value'),(769,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Analysis of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Brain Images using Structural Irregularities and Fusion Approaches','Ms. Sreelakshmi S (AM19D200)','Ph.

These conditions are associated with varying magnitude of changes occurring in the structures and functions of brain sub-anatomic regions. Magnetic Resonance (MR) images are widely used to differentiate MCI conditions as they are able to capture the structural changes in the brain regions. Identification of reliable MR image markers from disease specific brain regions is challenging due to the inherently subtle alterations occurring during the early stages of MCI. In this research, characterization of MCI conditions is carried out using MR image irregularity measures from two brain sub-anatomic structures that are predominantly affected in the early stages of the disease. The structural irregularities in these regions are captured using linear and non-linear image processing methods and are further combined using appropriate feature fusion techniques. Machine learning algorithms are also employed for the differentiation of MCI conditions and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. In this talk, the objectives, methods, significant results, and salient contributions will be discussed.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline meeting Link: https://meet.google.com/xzr-epsv-aac','','',1,'2024-07-03 06:23:00','Active'),(770,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','FLOOD INUNDATION MODELING AND RISK MAPPING IN AREAS WITH LIMITED DATA: STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING UNCERTAINTIES AND CONSTRAINTS','Ms. Jesna Roll No : CE17D026','Ph.D. Scholar','r.

In the presentation, we attempt to uncover aspects of combustion dynamics in swirl combustion with gaseous fuel in the form of experimental analysis using several spatio-temporal methods and reduced order model. The thesis is structured to point to subtle aspects of stable combustion, with understanding transition to instability by providing a lower order model and anomalies during stable combustion. Subsequently,\r\ncombustion instability is characterized in the form of flame patterns that are dominant in influencing\r\nthe heat release rate as well as their relationship with unsteady pressure.\r\nWe begin our discussion with symbolic time series analysis and state transition matrices for unsteady pressure and flame chemiluminescence. This involves analyzing the unsteady time-traces in both time and frequency domain, with either chemiluminescence and unsteady pressure showing differences in distribution of amplitude while being similar in the narrowing of frequency band while transitioning to instability. We model the shift and narrowing of the frequency band through an analogous Kuramato oscillator model and Van-der-Pol oscillator for unsteady pressure. We modify the parameters of the model through simple probability rules, which in-turn generates dynamical states similar to those observed in experiments. We show that the the period of synchronization and the number of oscillators undergoing the phase synchronization dictates the modulation in frequency and amplitude of oscillations.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, we employ tools from Machine learning to obtain a one-one mapping between measures based on flame images and unsteady pressure. It is observed that unsteady pressure in the present work has a Gaussian distribution with high p-values containing amplitudes comparable to those during unstable combustion. A neural network framework based on the hidden variables to possess normal distribution is seen to perform better than direct summation of pixel intensities in exhibiting the mapping with unsteady pressure.\r\n\r\nWe subsequently shift our attention to combustion instability with focus on patterns in flame images. The patterns are identified through a measure based on Hilbert transform, based on scale invariant feature transform to identify rotational symmetry and then to conclude, a deep neural network. The key patterns as deciphered from Hilbert transform and from detecting rotational symmetry involve flame curling near the swirler followed by flame merging and shedding as an axisymmetric branch. While the former is associated with constructive interference with pressure, the latter is seen to have a varying phase with unsteady pressure owing to convection. A notable aspect of the present work lies in correlating the broadening of the pressure peak to that of the number of centers of rotational symmetry present near the swirler in the flame holder.\r\n\r\nThe contribution of different spatio-temporal flame modes in causing the broadening of the peak of unsteady pressure is unravelled through the variational autoencoder based sparse data reconstruction of the flame images. Modal analysis of the flame images using this technique reveals that higher skweness in the modal intensity is observed in flame pattern corresponding to axisymmetric branch, while the unsteady pressure is driven by flame in the vicinity of the flame holder and by a phase of the convecting axisymmetric flame branch downstream of the swirler. The phase difference between the two modes would aid the broadening of the unsteady pressure in addition to the persistence of vortex centers.','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/vht-benc-hbg','','',1,'2024-07-03 08:43:45','Active'),(772,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Technological Breakthroughs and Market Adoption Strategies of Smart Insoles for Diabetic Foot Neuropathy','Mr. Karthikeyan S (AM21S401)','MS research scholar, Dept. of Applied Mechanics & Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras','Guide(s) - Dr. Babji Srinivasan & Dr. Rajagopalan Srinivasan(CH)','Department of Applied Mechanics & Biomedical Engineering','2024/07/05 14:00','2024-07-05','yes','Online meeting link : https://meet.google.com/okh-jxjg-rya   ','Gait plays a pivotal role in human movement, and we exhibit a unique gait pattern. The change in gait pattern results in increased chances of injury and falling. When the person experiences an injury or some underlying medical condition (i.e. Chronic diseases like diabetes), it alters the gait pattern. Through extensive primary and secondary market research, it was identified that people affected with diabetic neuropathy problems experience higher plantar pressure and end up with foot ulcers. The standard method to measure plantar pressure distribution is through a force plate or pressure mat during activities like walking, running, etc. The main drawbacks of this system are the limited measuring range, capital costs, and calibrations. Offloading diabetic shoes is prescribed based on foot pressure distribution; despite wearing the offloading shoes, diabetes complains about the shoe\'s effectiveness. Based on the discovery, it was noticed that most diabetic care hospitals don\'t have sophisticated instruments to understand the effectiveness of the prescribed shoes.\r\nThese drawbacks can be eliminated by introducing an IoT-enabled smart insole system. This smart insole measures the user\'s foot pressure in real time, along with the triaxial acceleration and angular velocity. Our proprietary software helps visualize the video and data in near real-time with enriched metrics, including pressure graphs, heatmap, the centre of pressure tragedory, IMU metrics, etc. This insole data helps understand the gait pattern and the video to make informed decisions. The smart insole also helps in the early identification of foot neuropathy and reduces further foot complications. This research focuses on customer discovery, identifying the beachhead market from other markets like orthopaedics, rehabilitation, product development, market study and understanding the optimal way of commercializing the product\r\nKeywords:  Diabetic foot ulcer, Diabetic neuropathy problem, Smart Insoles, Internet of Things\r\n','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline meeting link: https://meet.google.com/okh-jxjg-rya','','',1,'2024-07-03 09:27:27','Active'),(773,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','BANDGAP-ENGINEERED FERROELECTRIC BaTiO3-BASED OXIDES FOR PHOTOVOLTAIC APPLICATIONS','Mr. SARATH N V, (PH17D033)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide: Dr. MURUGAVEL P','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/07/09 11:00','2024-07-09','yes','HSB-209, Seminar Hall, Department of Physics ','Recently, ferroelectric photovoltaics got wide research attention due to anomalous photovoltage and switchable photoresponse. However, the low absorption bandwidth of the ferroelectrics due to their large bandgap results in low photocurrent. This necessitates the search towards tuning the bandgap for better absorption properties. There are few attempts in the literature to reduce the bandgap but at the expense of ferroelectric properties. This trade-off between bandgap tuning and ferroelectric polarization is an open problem in ferroelectric photovoltaics. The present work addresses this problem and demonstrates novel ferroelectric material with considerable polarization at room temperature. In this work, a bandgap-engineered ferroelectric material of the composition (1-x)BaTiO3-xBi(Ni2/3Nb1/3)O3 (BTBNN) with x = 0 to 0.05 has been chosen for the study. The BTBNN sample shows bandgap tuning from 3.1 eV to 2.4 eV for doping variations of x = 0 to 0.05, with considerable polarization and open-circuit voltage of 6 V. The reduction in bandgap is analyzed with respect to structural distortions due to doping and the concentration of oxygen or cationic vacancies. Our results suggest that samples with large cationic vacancies show better absorption with less leakage characteristics than those with more significant oxygen vacancies. This part of the work provides an alternative approach to designing the low bandgap ferroelectrics by means of cationic vacancies in the system. Furthermore, the ferroelectric system with optimized composition is fabricated into an epitaxial thin film geometry. The epitaxial film grown under compressively strained conditions on SrRuO3 buffered SrTiO3(100) single crystalline substrate is demonstrated for the novel phenomena of flexophotovoltaic effect.','HoD Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-03 09:41:45','Active'),(774,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL',' Classical Bandit Algorithms for Entanglement Detection in Parameterized Qubit States','Ms. Bharati K (EE20D700)','Ph.D Scholar,  Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Krishna Jagannathan ','Electrical Engineering','2024/07/23 11:00','2024-07-23','yes','ESB 234/Googlemeet','We establish a novel correspondence between the problem of entanglement detection and the Bad Arm Identification problem in stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB).

Multispectral imaging, known for its ability to capture images across multiple spectra, stands out by providing in-depth information compared to traditional imaging solutions. While dental professionals have direct access to the oral region, visualizing specific areas can be challenging without suitable tools. This system introduces an innovative method that utilizes endoscope-based multispectral imaging technology for analyzing oral regions affected by cancer. \r\n \r\nOur multispectral imaging system comprises an imaging sensor with a resolution of 270 x 510 pixels across 16 spectral bands (460 nm to 600 nm), attached to a rigid scope (4 mm - diameter, 0-degree tip angle, 175 mm - length) using a lens coupler. A study was conducted on 10 subjects diagnosed with oral cancer, collecting data with and without endoscope, with a total of 320 images. The acquired images of cancerous tissue was analysed in two ways to identify their spectral signatures. \r\n \r\nIn the first analysis we compared the accuracy of the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm for detecting malignant lesions. The SAM detected output was validated with the ground truth (manually annotated by a dentist) and the results showcased an overall accuracy score of 64.14%, with patient-specific accuracy ranging from as high as 92.84% to as low as 29.53%. \r\n \r\nIn the second analysis, we examined the distance between the spectral signatures of malignant and non-malignant tissue from the images captured using endoscope and non-endoscope methods. The mean difference was 0.7582 for the endoscope method and 0.4218 for the non-endoscope method, indicating the superior detection capability of endoscope based method. \r\n \r\nOur findings indicate that information from the endoscope-based multispectral imaging system is an effective method for detecting malignancy, especially when combined with SAM and spectral signature analysis, outperforming non-endoscope-based and traditional methods. Overall, our study demonstrates that endoscope-assisted multispectral imaging for oral cancer detection is highly effective and holds significant potential for the design and development of an oral cancer diagnostic device.\r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/xko-pbty-bym','','',1,'2024-07-03 09:58:31','Active'),(776,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Spatialities of Vallam: Exploring Ownership, Toil and Embedded Practices of Fishing','Mr. Nidheesh S (HS15D006)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras.','Prof. Solomon J Benjamin, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras.','Department of Humanities and Social Sciences','2024/07/11 15:00','2024-07-11','yes','Google meet','The main argument proposed in my research is that a conceptual frame focusing on multiple spatialities helps problematise how various constellations of groups, often in contestations over territory and other realms, mobilise various material logics.

As part of this research, a comprehensive analysis of the science teaching practices at the different Indian school boards, at a rural education centre, and through online mode during the COVID-19 lockdown, was conducted. Teacher interviews and classroom observations were employed as the main methods of this qualitative study. By interviewing the school science teachers from several school boards, the research showed that the current science pedagogical practices followed in most Indian schools show significant shortcomings when it comes to hands-on teaching, learning by doing, argumentation and peer interaction, which are important teaching practices to improve scientific literacy. Elite private schools following the Cambridge syllabus, IGCSE pattern and alternative pedagogical practices teach science using state-of-the-art teaching methods with more hands-on learning and peer interactions. The activity-based learning followed in the Rishi Valley Rural Education Centre (REC) serves as a model suitable not only for science education in rural single-teacher schools, but could in fact offer useful insights for science education as such.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of how online science teaching happened during the COVID-19 lockdown revealed the possibilities and challenges of online science education. It exposed the digital divide that exists in the Indian education scenario. The thesis concludes with the insights gained from the science teaching practices followed in schools like the Rishi Valley Rural Education Centre in India that could be implemented in schools with governmental support and training. The scope of incorporating online methods into school science teaching cannot be ignored since the importance of online teaching in science education is increasing and recordable online classes along with stable net access offer several important advantages.\r\n','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/uzc-dyyo-cyx','','',1,'2024-07-03 11:12:42','Active'),(778,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Study of Transition Metal-Based Electrocatalysts for Electrochemical Water Splitting that are Influenced by Cerium','Ms. K U Priyanka Swarnkar, Roll No. ME15D059','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM\r\n','Guide - Prof. V.

Concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies are widely used to\r\nharness solar power. One such CSP technology is the parabolic dish collector (PDC), a\r\npoint-focused and matured system for power generation and process heating\r\napplications. The solar rays are focused after reflection off a reflective surface onto the\r\nreceiver used in the PDC system at its focal zone, providing uniformly distributed heat\r\nflux over a larger surface rather than the peak flux at one point. In a PDC system, solar\r\nradiation focuses on the absorber, where heat losses occur from the receiver due to high\r\ntemperature and wind. This factor greatly influences the thermal efficiency of the\r\nsystem. The first problem discussed is lowering heat loss, essential to effectively\r\nutilizing solar energy and boosting the system\'s performance. Cavity receivers are most\r\npreferred for PDC systems to minimize heat losses. The first conical-shaped receiver\r\nhas been considered for analysis, evaluating heat loss for different tilts of the receiver\r\nunder varying wind speeds and directions, and later, the hetero-conical receiver in\r\nsubsequent studies.\r\n\r\nThe second problem discussed is to develop the integrated optical-thermal model to\r\nsimulate the wind around the PDC system with receivers and evaluate the collector\'s\r\noptical and thermal efficiencies. The sun shape and surface errors are considered for the\r\nsolar parabolic dish to build an accurate optical model using Monte-Carlo ray tracing. The user-defined sun shape and surface error of 3 mrad are adopted. The optical\r\nefficiency is 86.87% and 84.15% for conical and hetero-conical receivers, respectively.\r\nLater, the concentrated heat flux obtained from the optical model is used in thermal\r\nanalysis to build the integrated model using the user-defined function. Therminol 66, as\r\nheat transfer fluid, and air as immediate surroundings, are two fluids considered in\r\nthermal investigations. The influential parameters are tilt angles, wind speeds, wind\r\ndirections, and inlet temperatures, which are to be considered for both the receivers and\r\nthe parabolic dish in the model. The thermal performances of 69.23% and 73.11% are\r\nthe maximum for the parabolic dish collectors with conical and hetero-conical\r\nreceivers, respectively. Next, a deep learning approach is implemented to evaluate\r\nthermal performance under input conditions. The different activation functions are\r\ncompared, and the exponential linear unit (ELU) is chosen as the best activation\r\nfunction in the study. The experimental investigation is also performed for the\r\nsimplified receiver model and validated with a numerical model in subsequent analyses.\r\n\r\nFurther, energy storage is a significant challenge that comes with CSP technologies.\r\nThe phase change material-based thermal energy storage (TES) system is adopted for\r\nlow-temperature applications. The least effectiveness of 0.8 has been opted for design\r\noptimization for effective heat exchange between heat transfer fluid and phase change\r\nmaterial in the TES system. The effect of geometrical and operating parameters,\r\nincluding tube diameter, length, initial temperature, inlet temperature, and volumetric\r\nflow rate, are considered and evaluated for the effective storage capacity and\r\nperformance of the TES system. The thesis presents a holistic approach using integrated\r\noptical-thermal analysis of the PDC system and modeling of the TES systems, which\r\nwill help design and optimize the systems for solar energy conversion and storage for\r\nprocess heating applications.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in',' KEYWORDS Solar energy, solar parabolic dish collector, thermal analysis, optical analysis, integrat','','',1,'2024-07-04 02:34:10','Active'),(780,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- இல்லம், வீடு (illam, veedu)\r\nHindi word	- घर (ghar)\r\nEnglish word	- House','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-04 04:27:33','default_value'),(781,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Bioinspired fibre-reinforced polymer composites and their mechanical  properties','Ms. SHREYA RAI (Roll NO: AE20D405)','Ph.D. Scholar, Department of Aerospace Engineering.','Dr. Prashant Rawat, Guide                                                ','Department of Aerospace Engineering','2024/07/05 15:00','2024-07-05','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Link -   meet.google.com/iax-trug-gak','','',1,'2024-07-04 05:51:54','Active'),(782,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','DYNAMICS AND STABILITY OF  MORPHING WING WITH TIME-VARYING STIFFNESS','Mr.Manoj Prabhakar (AE20D201)','Ph.D scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','Dr. Senthil Murugan - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/07/05 16:00','2024-07-05','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/qjm-heki-hpp','','',1,'2024-07-04 05:54:05','Active'),(783,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Accelerating the Pace of Digital Transformation: Impact on the Oil and Gas Industry:','Dr. Phaneendra Kondapi ','Dr. Phaneendra Kondapi is an Affiliate Professor at Colorado School of Mines in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering and President of Jaajitech Digital.

Although GaN HEMTs have demonstrated excellent performance in power switching and RF power amplifier applications, they still suffer from stability and reliability issues. These problems arise from the trapping of charge carriers in the deep levels present in the different parts of the device. Thus, it is important to find out the spatial location of traps in the device and their nature through electrical/optical measurements to further improve the quality of the hetero-epitaxial layers of the GaN-wafers and enhance the performance of the device. Among different stability and reliability issues, kink effect is one of the prominent concerns of GaN-HEMTs which affects the linearity of the RF power amplifier. The inter-band impact ionization in the GaN-channel and trapping/de-trapping of charge carriers are the two possible mechanisms responsible for the kink effect in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. However, the origin of the kink effect in AlInN/GaN devices has not been studied in literature.\r\n\r\nIn this work, it is established that the trapping/de-trapping of charge carriers is responsible for the kink effect AlInN/GaN HEMTs, studied here. On the shining of light, trans-conductance dispersion in the transfer characteristics was observed without any shift in the threshold voltage. Hence it can be concluded that the traps are present in the drain access region and not under the gate. The traps can either be present in the surface/passivation layer or AlInN barrier layer or GaN buffer layer of the HEMT device. The back-gating experiment used in this work confirmed that the traps responsible for the kink are present in GaN buffer layer. Temperature-dependent non-monotonic nature of the kink amplitude implied that the de-trapping is by hot-electron assisted and not by field-assisted mechanism. The effect of charge/potential stored in the GaN buffer layer after stressing the substrate with different voltages on the device dynamic behavior is also studied. During stress applied on the substrate, the electrons get trapped by deep levels present in GaN-buffer layers of GaN-on-Si HEMT. The hypothesis for positive and negative charge distribution in GaN buffer layer is proposed and validated by 2D-TCAD simulations. Due to the longer emission time constant of these deep levels the charges are stored in the GaN buffer layer even after the stress is removed. Hence, the potential is stored in the GaN buffer layer, which affects the device stability. The kink in the output characteristics is observed after the stress is removed. Temperature-dependent transient drain current measurements are carried out to find out the signature of the traps which are responsible for the kink effect in this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/yzi-dois-qfz','','',1,'2024-07-04 09:05:58','Active'),(789,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','New dimensions in breast cancer diagnosis using optical spectroscopy','Ms. Subitcha J (AM19D004)','Ph.

Inadequate tumor resection with positive margins is a frequent problem and has a 12% incidence worldwide. It leads to cancer resurrection and increased adjuvant treatment costs and morbidity. Optical spectroscopic techniques, especially fluorescence imaging and Raman spectroscopy, are very beneficial in tumor resection. Though they are suitable for intraoperative procedures, the cost involved, speed of signal acquisition and sensitivity and specificity are a few associated shortcomings. This work demonstrates bi-modal optical spectroscopy using Raman and Fluorescence spectroscopy that is quick and cost-effective and provides accurate quantitative margin predictions by leveraging the complementary advantages of combining them. This is achieved by designing a novel multi-modal silicone-based phantom for calibrating multi-modal spectroscopy followed by fluorescence mapping for quickly scanning a large suspicious area. Finally, low-resolution bi-modal spectroscopy is used to predict the tumor localization parameters, such as depth and thickness of the tumor, with improved accuracy compared to independent modalities. Further, in-silico investigations are carried out to optimize the margin prediction using single-channel Spatially Offset Raman spectroscopy and machine learning techniques. Additionally, Routine mammographic screening of breast cancer increases ionizing radiation exposure risks; hence, a screening method intermediate between physical examination and mammography using short-span temporal fluorescence spectroscopy from liquid samples is also demonstrated.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline Meeting Link: https://meet.google.com/aqp-qbgo-wff','','',1,'2024-07-04 09:43:03','Active'),(790,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL',' â€œOPTIMIZING VANADIUM AND SOLUBLE LEAD REDOX FLOW BATTERIES FOR EFFICIENT ENERGY STORAGE: A STUDY ON ELECTRODE, ELECTROLYTE, AND MEMBRANE MODIFICATIONS AND SCALE UPâ€ ',' Mr. Harun Khan (CY18D088)','Ph.D. Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide - Professor Kothandaraman R, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/07/06 15:00','2024-07-06','yes','Online-Google Meet','','CY OFFICE','cyoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','ALL ARE WELCOME-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/exx-etdj-dtd ','','',1,'2024-07-04 11:38:34','Active'),(791,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Development of a Micro-Turning Machine for Intelligent Performance Prediction in Ti-6Al-4V Alloy Machining Using Textured Inserts','Mr. Tere Rajesh Babu (ME17D019)','PhD, Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering','Guide Name: Prof. GL Samuel, ME /\r\nDC members: Dr. Somashekhar S.

Hit and trial methods are usually adapted to obtain reproducible shake flask biomass productivity in the bioreactor. In this study, a rational approach has been developed to design bioreactors for plant cell cultures using computational fluid dynamics (CFD).\r\nA two-phase CFD model was developed to characterise the fluid dynamics in shake flask and a stirred tank bioreactor (STR) using different impeller designs used in fermentations including, a low-shear setric impeller, commonly-used rushton turbine and marine impeller. The impact of impeller design was then investigated on critical process parameters like mixing, oxygen mass transfer and shear. The comparative analysis demonstrated that the setric impeller could offer low-shear environment at equivalent mixing with higher cell-lift capabilities which is preferable in high cell-density plant cell cultivations. \r\nFurther, the impact of change in hydrodynamics from shake flask to bioreactor is presumably responsible for the non- reproducibility and decrease in biomass productivity in plant cell cultivations. This was substantiated from the experimental studies in shake-flask, wherein no significant decrease in the biomass productivity was observed with the increase in working (flask) volume. The CFD model simulations in shake flask indicated that oxygen mass transfer may not be the only limiting factor for mass-cultivation of plant cell suspension cultures.  A comparative analysis also indicated that the low-shear setric impeller design can result in hydrodynamics similar to that in shake flask, leading to a reproducible biomass productivity in a batch bioreactor. This was experimentally verified by plant cell cultivation of Viola odorata in STR with a low-shear setric impeller.  In addition, the effect of non-Newtonian behaviour of high cell-density plant cell suspension cultures on the hydrodynamic environment in bioreactors was also investigated using CFD model simulations. It was observed that the cavern size that distinguishes pseudoplastic fluid flow decreased significantly with cell growth after mid-log phase, and the gas-flow was under flooding conditions. This information can be used further for optimising the impeller and sparger design and operating conditions to overcome the aforementioned limitations for improved biomass productivity in STR. \r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-04 12:50:40','Active'),(793,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Dual-mode second harmonic generation (DMSH) on guided media','Mr. Krishnadas V K, Roll No. ME14D116','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide - Prof. Krishnan Balasubramanian, ME, IITM','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/07/08 09:00','2024-07-08','yes','Through Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/sus-apia-mfw','','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/sus-apia-mfw','','',1,'2024-07-04 15:50:58','Active'),(794,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Transcritical CO2 heat pump and refrigeration systems for Indian applications','Mr. A M Guruchethan, Roll No. ME17D040','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide - Prof(retd).

It has gained even more relevance\r\nin view of the global effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Safety in such systems is\r\nparamount, as any nuclear accident has the potential for an enormous environmental\r\nimpact. Fast reactors are high energy density systems requiring a very efficient heat\r\ntransport medium. Most fast reactors worldwide use liquid metal (sodium) as coolant\r\nowing to its high thermal conductivity and high heat transfer coefficient within nuclear\r\nfuel subassemblies. Fuel and structural materials can melt during a severe accident in\r\na fast reactor (called a hypothetical core disruptive accident due to its extremely low\r\nprobability). This mixture of materials called corium forms at very high temperatures\r\n( 2800â—¦C) and travels towards the bottom regions of the reactor vessel under gravity.\r\nAs part of mitigation measures it must be ensured that the main reactor vessel is not\r\nbreached. Towards this a dedicated structure called the core catcher is placed over the\r\nmain reactor vessel. The core catcher contains all the corium, ensures coolability and\r\nprevents recriticality. The present work is a small step towards the resolution of the\r\nrelocation process of the molten corium from the bottom of the core to the core catcher.\r\nMolten corium travels through a long column of coolant sodium. Essentially,\r\nmultiple complex phenomena would co-exist such as two-phase flow, solidification of\r\ncorium, boiling of sodium, setting up of thermal stresses in solidified corium drops\r\nand heat generation in corium drops due to radioactive decay. The settling behaviour\r\nover the core catcher is a critical parameter required to be resolved in order to ensure\r\neffective mitigation strategies. The first part of the transient is expected to be influenced primarily by two-phase flow instabilities. Two-phase flow instabilities will lead to the\r\nbreakup of the corium jet into smaller droplets. This phase is expected to have the\r\nmost significant influence on the settling behaviour of corium on the core catcher. This\r\nforms the main focus of the present work. Multi-phase flows with moving interfaces, in\r\ngeneral, lie at the heart of several important physical and industrial processes and are\r\nchallenging to solve due to the inherent complex physics involved. A robust and accurate\r\ntwo-phase flow solver based on the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method has been developed\r\n(THYC-MP) to capture the physics of initial corium movement in sodium. The present\r\nimplementation is limited to two-dimensional orthogonal and non-uniform grids. The\r\nVOF method is used due to its advantages with respect to stringent mass conservation\r\nof each phase. Each significant step, viz. interface reconstruction, interface advection\r\nand curvature calculation, has been looked at critically and important improvements\r\nhave been devised. A new class of interface reconstruction methods, the Piecewise\r\nCircular Interface Construction (PCIC) method, has been proposed. The method uses a\r\npiecewise circular reconstruction of a two-phase interface and is shown to be significantly\r\nmore accurate than the standard Piecewise Linear methods (PLIC) and is comparable\r\nto existing higher-order methods. The accuracy and order of convergence are shown\r\nusing randomised reconstruction of standard shapes chosen from the literature. The\r\nmethod also is simpler to implement than many higher-order methods. It achieves\r\nhigh accuracy by implementing a c0-correction on an optimised base piecewise circular\r\ninterface obtained using circular fit methods.\r\n\r\nThe highly accurate edge-matched flux polygon advection (EMFPA) method has\r\nbeen implemented for interface advection. The version implemented here is a highly\r\nefficient one that calculates the vertices of the flux polygon from analytical relations. A\r\nfractional stepping based template to improve accuracy of unsplit geometric advection\r\nmethods has been proposed. With the help of dynamic interface reconstruction problems,\r\n\r\nviz. vortex in a box and the four vortex problem, the superior accuracy of the PCIC-\r\nEMFPA combination is shown. Further, the curvature calculation is based on a variable stencil-based Height Function (HF) method. A hybrid method taking advantage of the\r\naccuracy of reconstruction of the PCIC method and curvature calculation of the Height\r\nFunction method is devised. Towards this, a general template for improving the PLIC\r\ninterface itself has been proposed. This step allows the successful blending of the PCIC\r\nand HF methods. All the improvements proposed as part of the present work have been\r\nbrought together within the framework of a force-balanced projection-based two-phase\r\nflow solver. The formulation is fully implicit. A preconditioned biconjugate gradient\r\n(stabilised) method is used to solve the implicit equations. The whole implementation is\r\ndone using MATLAB scripting. Several two-phase flow problems with complex physics\r\nfrom the literature have been used to validate the present implementation.\r\n\r\nFinally, the movement of molten corium in sodium and a simulant system, i.e.\r\nWoodâ€™s metal in water, have been studied. As part of a separate development solver for\r\nsimulating phase change problems (solidification/melting) based on the Enthalpy-porosity\r\napproach has been developed. The solver is not only capable of tracking the melt interface\r\nbut, at the same time, resolves buoyancy-driven flow with the molten material. The\r\ndevelopments proposed as part of the present work will acts as pre-cursors to further\r\ndevelopments imbibing additional physics in the future.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','KEYWORDS Volume of Fluid; two-phase flow; phase-change; severe accident; fast reactor ; height funct','','',1,'2024-07-05 01:16:36','Active'),(797,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Fast Simulation Techniques for Sub-Continuum Transport','Prof. Jayathi Y.

Our work resolves the wave-vector space in detail; this is essential for understanding the physics underlying strongly non-equilibrium transport, such as that encountered in ultra-scaled transistors. However, phonon relaxation times in materials such as silicon span 4-5 orders of magnitude and the resulting spread in Knudsen number causes conventional computational algorithms to perform very poorly or even fail completely. Similar problems are encountered in rarefied gas dynamics, for example, in the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model and its variants.  We have developed fast convergent finite volume schemes which address this range of Knudsen number and which are 2-200 times faster than existing schemes and which scale extremely well on large-scale parallel platforms.

Standard large-scale production techniques produce microparticles with a broad particle size distribution and require challenging operating conditions. The spinning disk atomization (SDA) technique for microdroplet production, coupled with the solvent-antisolvent precipitation process, is presented here as a large-scale production method to generate drug-encapsulated microparticles with a narrow size distribution. For this purpose, an equipment with a non-contact seal system that integrates spinning disk atomization and precipitation methods for conducting laboratory experiments for drug particle production that involve volatile hydrocarbons is designed and fabricated. Using this equipment, by considering the operation, maintenance, and safety aspects, the production of drug-encapsulated microparticles is accomplished, and the system\'s efficiency is evaluated through material balance. It is seen that this laboratory equipment is capable of producing drug-encapsulated microparticles with a narrow size distribution under moderate operating conditions and can be scaled up suitably to meet high production requirements. The applications of this equipment can be explored in various fields, such as the production of drug particles, conversion of waste polymers into microparticles and fibers, and microencapsulation of food ingredients.\r\nRecent methods employing microfluidics have enabled the production of microparticles with a highly narrow size distribution. However, microparticle production methods using PDMS microfluidic devices and glass chips containing microchannels can handle only fluids with a limited range of physical and chemical properties and are faced with a variety of operation problems such as clogging, high operating pressures and offer only limited scope for reuse and modification. Further, the fabrication cost of these devices is very high. Even though there are microfluidic devices for particle production fabricated using glass capillaries, most of these are joined using adhesives, which are incompatible with many hydrocarbon solvents used in the drug encapsulation process and do not sustain long-term operation. This work presents a microfluidic device for microparticle production with removable capillaries that addresses these drawbacks. This device handles a variety of hydrocarbon solvents, allows easy replacement of capillaries, permits repeated use of the device over the long term, and facilitates the removal of air bubbles, impurities, coagulated droplets, and solid particles. Moreover, it can be fabricated easily using readily available components such as glass vials and capillaries at a meager cost in a glass-blowing facility. The experimental setup, chemical system, and procedures for drug encapsulation using this device are also discussed. The results of these experiments confirm that this custom-made glass microfluidic device for drug encapsulation can produce microparticles with an extremely narrow size distribution.','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkONLINE: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84911664213?pwd=x5MFtGyZT6bPYsftHu6GaJDmLjaGu4.','seminar05-07-2024 04:02','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar05-07-2024 04:02',1,'2024-07-05 04:02:25','Active'),(799,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- மருந்தகம் (marunthagam)\r\nHindi word	- भेषजी, भेषजशाला (bheshaji, bheshajshaala)\r\nEnglish word	- Pharmacy\r\n','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-05 04:25:34','default_value'),(800,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\"SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MULTICOMPONENT EQUIATOMIC MEDIUM AND HIGH ENTROPY PEROVSKITE OXIDES\"','Ms. ANNU SHARMA (MM15D405)','Ph.D Scholar, Dept. of MME','Guide: Dr. Bhattacharya S S, MME','Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering.','2024/07/09 11:00','2024-07-09','yes','Online','Perovskites are a class of ceramic materials which have the chemical formula ABX3 where A and B are cations of different sizes and X is an anion that is typically oxygen. The perovskite structure can be described as a framework of corner-shared BO6 octahedra with 12-coordinated A cations. The unit cell of an ideal perovskite structure is a cube, where the larger A-site cations are located at the corners of the cube while the smaller B-site cation sits in the body centre and the anion sits in the face centre. \r\nIn this study, multicomponent equiatomic perovskite oxides were synthesized by the reverse co-precipitation (RCP) process, followed by a calcination step. The multiple cations, chosen for site A were lead (Pb), strontium (Sr), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), lanthanum (La), neodymium (Nd), and praseodymium (Pr). These cations were chosen based on Paulingâ€™s and Hume-Rothery principles for single phase formation. Titanium (Ti) was fixed as the site B cation. For all the elements, nitrate salts were used as precursors except in the case of titanium where titanium n-butoxide was used. The target compositions were (CaPbSr)TiO3. (CaLaNaSr)TiO3, (CaNaNdSr)TiO3, (CaNaPrSr)TiO3, (CaGdNaSr)TiO3, (CaLaNaPbSr)TiO3, (CaNaNdPbSr)TiO3, (CaNaPbPrSr)TiO3 and [CaNaPbSr(LaNdPr)]TiO3.\r\nThe phases present in the calcined powders were determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD). All the systems except (CaNaGdSr)TiO3 and (CaNaPbPrSr)TiO3 formed single-phase tetragonal structure with I 4/m n m space group. The percentages of the various phases present and the structural parameters were obtained by Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns. The particle size and morphology were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The particle sizes for all the systems except (CaPbSr)TiO3 were observed to be in the nano regime. The elemental compositions were determined using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and the elements at site A were found to be in near-equiatomic proportions. The homogenous distribution of all the elements was confirmed by elemental mapping. The vibrational bonds in the samples were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Structural bond analysis was done using Raman spectroscopy and the results were in agreement with the XRD results.\r\nThe bandgap values of the phase-pure powders were studied using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The systems were found to have indirect bandgaps with values in the range of 2.51 to 3.07 eV which was lower than those of the individual titanates. The direct bandgaps of the systems were also determined to be in the range of 2.82 to 3.37 eV which was also lower than those of the individual titanates. The dielectric properties of the phase-pure systems were studied by dielectric broadband spectroscopy after making the powders into suitable pellets by conventional sintering. At room temperature, the (CaPbSr)TiO3 system exhibited the highest dielectric constant. The systems containing rare earth elements showed lower dielectric constant values. The systems containing lead exhibited higher values of the dielectric constant. All the systems showed relaxation processes as observed from the electric modulus curves as a function of the frequency.

Microcrystalline (MCD), nanocrystalline (NCD) and functionally graded diamond films of ~5 Âµm thickness were synthesised, and the structural, topological and mechanical/tribological properties  evaluated and compared. Nanoindentation studies revealed the hardness values to lie in the range of ~ 25 GPa for the NCD and FGC coatings to ~ 38 GPa for the MCD film.\r\nDiamond films were deposited on RB-SiC in a single-step continuous process  by varying the HF-CVD process parameters such that the initially deposited diamond grains were microcrystalline, which became progressively finer with further deposition (labelled C-MC). In contrast, intermittently grown films with one, two and three-layered structures (labelled Ix-MC, x being the number of layers), each layer with decreasing grain size was deposited with the same recipes as that of the C-MC. Fine grains in the range of 0.2â€“0.7 Î¼m were identified in the C-MC and sharply faceted diamond crystallites having sizes between 0.5- 2 Î¼m were seen in the intermittently deposited coatings. The hardness values were 71 GPa, 56 GPa and 46 GPa for the one, two and three layered intermittent coatings respectively. In contrast, a lower hardness of 29 GPa was obtained in C-MC. The friction coefficients of all the diamond films were measured up to 106 sliding cycles (530 m) using a ball-on-disc universal tribometer. In the initial stages of sliding, the continuously grown C-MC exhibited a friction coefficient ~0.17, while the intermittently coated three-layered film (I3-MC) showed a friction coefficient of 0.28. However, beyond 40,000 sliding cycles, the friction coefficient of I3-MC showed a value of ~0.05, which was slightly lower than C-MC (~0.06).   \r\nThe temperature-dependent residual stresses and thermal stabilities of the C-ML and Ix-ML (sliced from C-MC and Ix-MC ) coatings after annealing at 100o intervals from 100 â„ƒ â€“ 800 â„ƒ were investigated. 2D/3D Raman mapping, cluster analysis, and sp2/sp3 ratio computations were carried out at all stages and the results compared. The residual stresses of the as-deposited coatings, I1-ML, I2-ML, I3-ML, and C-ML, were compressive with values of  ~1.09 GPa,  ~0.90 GPa, ~0.62 GPa and ~1.35 GPa, respectively, which progressively shifted to the tensile regime on annealing and exhibited values of ~0.50 GPa, ~0.50 GPa, ~0.61 GPa and ~1.75 GPa respectively, after annealing at 700 â„ƒ. The sp2/sp3 ratios of the C-ML and I3-ML coatings dropped from 0.94% to 0.54% and 1.07% to 0.54%, respectively, as the annealing temperature increased from 100 to 700 â„ƒ. All coatings were completely oxidised at 800 â„ƒ except I3-ML, where patches of the original coating persisted even after annealing at 800 â„ƒ.','MME OFFICE','mmoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/wrm-shhv-qnp','','',1,'2024-07-05 05:29:06','Active'),(802,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Switchless constitutive relation for passive myocardium that accounts for the distinct load-bearing characteristics of collagen and muscle fibers in compression.','Mr. Tammisetti Hari Sai Chaitanya (ME20S056)','MS Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide Name : Dr. Krishna Kannan, ME /\r\nGTC MEMBERS: Dr. Chandramouli (Chair person), Dr. Manoj Pandey, Dr. Sivasambu Mahesh','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/07/05 16:30','2024-07-05','yes','Through Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/hsi-ehir-mhf ','Unlike collagen fibers which cannot sustain compressive loads, muscle fibers in cardiac tissue may sustain some level of compression owing to their larger diameter and also due to their crosslinks with the collagen fibers. On using a novel matched-invariant whose value during compression: 1) is exactly zero for the collagen fibers and 2) ranges between zero and a maximum for the muscle fibers, determined by the level of crosslinking, the compressive load-bearing hypothesis is achieved in the orthotropic hyperelastic modeling of passive myocardium. Therefore, a tension-compression switch criterion is not required. The dispersion of the fibers is taken into account using the framework developed by Gasser, Ogden, and Holzapfel using the Generalized Structure Tensor approach, allowing for the direct incorporation of microstructural information into the constitutive relation. It is demonstrated that the model predictions coincide quite well with the biaxial and triaxial shear responses reported in the literature. As an added advantage, the matched-invariant naturally involves the I5 invariant, eliminating the constitutive defect of identical shear responses that results from modeling soft tissues using only the I4 invariant.\r\n\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/hsi-ehir-mhf ','','',1,'2024-07-05 05:36:07','Active'),(803,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','UNIFIED MODELLING FRAMEWORK FOR MULTI-DAY MODE CHOICE OF COMMUTERS','Mr. Ganesh Ambi Ramakrishnan, Roll No. CE15D071','Ph.D Scholar','Dr Karthik K Srinivasan - Guide, Dr Koshy Varghese - DC Member, Dr Gitakrishnan Ramadurai - DC Member, Dr Neelesh S Upadhye, MA - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairman, DC & Head,CE','Civil Engineering','2024/07/06 14:30','2024-07-06','yes','BSB 104 , Conference Room','','Manikandan R, CE Office','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-05 05:46:34','Active'),(804,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','DEVELOPMENT AND ANALYSIS OF ORGANIC SEMICONDUCTOR BASED BULK-HETEROJUNCTION DEVICES ','Mr. Rajdeep Dhar (EE15D310)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering.

Mahadevan. It adopts a matrifocal reading of the novels as proposed by Andrea Oâ€™Reilly, whereby the understanding of the text â€œattends to and accentuates the maternal thematic in any given textâ€ (Oâ€™Reilly 17). This research frames motherhood centrally through Adrienne Richâ€™s theorisation of motherhood. Rich defines â€˜motheringâ€™ as â€œthe potential relationship of any woman to her powers of reproduction and to childrenâ€ (1xi). She posits that the actual experience of this role could be seen as a source of empowerment if utilised efficiently in contrast to â€˜motherhoodâ€™, which is â€œthe institution which aims at ensuring that all women shall remain under male controlâ€ (1xi). This thesis contextualises motherhoodâ€™s normative appeal and cultural import and resists the universality appeal of motherhood by bringing non-normative mothers to the centre; it also discusses the motherâ€™s experientiality, sexuality, and agency, drawing from concepts such as â€˜maternal ambivalenceâ€™ (Takseva 2017), â€˜mater-normativityâ€™ (Nandy 2017), â€˜maternal thinkingâ€™ (Ruddick 2007), â€˜maternal enthrallmentâ€™ (Kakar 2016), and â€˜internalized exileâ€™ (Katrak 2006). It looks at motherhood as socially and historically constructed by patriarchy and contests the fixed, stable and essentialist identity of motherhood. It investigates the representation of the maternal figures vis-Ã -vis a power spectrum to posit that both agency and victimhood co-exist in uncomfortable ways. Since the emphasis of the chosen novels is on the discourse of choice and empowerment, and as there is a shift in the narratives from implications of victimhood to connotations of agency, my thesis will also employ a postfeminist analytical framework to evaluate revisionist popular fiction to demonstrate contemporary cultural negotiations of femininity with patriarchy.\r\nReferences:\r\nKakar, Sudhir. â€œThe Engulfing Mother in Indian Mythology: Masculinity and Conflicting 	Desires.â€ Antyajaa: Indian Journal of Women and Social Change 1.1, 2016, pp. 60-	64.\r\nKatrak, Ketu H.

Shape Memory Alloys are also a class of Smart Materials and they respond to external stimuli without human interference. SMAs are used in mechanical, civil, structural and earthquake engineering due to their attractive damping and functional characteristics. By using a prediction tool, we can narrow down the number of alloys to be tested and validated. This helps in reducing the time, money and resources required to prepare different alloy samples, and finding their transformation temperatures. The major aim of this project is to predict new shape memory alloy compositions for high transformation temperatures and high damping capacity. First part of the work studies the design of an ANN model so as to predict the transformation temperatures of NiTiZr alloys with different chemical compositions. Using the existing data on the ternary NiTiZr alloy, a multilayer feed-forward back-propagation neural network was proposed, trained, and evaluated. A matrix was created and used that envisages new alloy compositions after the ANN model was refined by empirically selecting the feature set, normalization parameter, and number of nodes. A novel alloy composition (Ni49Ti36Zr15) with the requisite properties was produced. The values obtained from the experiments and those predicted by the ANN are in conformity with one another. Second part deals with the Prediction of three new FeMnSi ternary and FeMnSi based quinary Shape Memory Alloy compositions using Artificial Neural Network, the range whose transformation temperatures and hysteresis are suitable for Impact dampeners and Earthquake resistors application for high damping capacity applications. The ev/a ratio has influence over the transformation temperatures (Ms, As). At nearly constant ev/a value and composition range, the transformation hysteresis increases with the atomic diameter of the alloying element. The predicted compositions of Fe58.71Mn30.08Si11.21, and Fe62.94Mn12.82Si9.24Ni5.23Cr9.77 yield a large hysteresis of 95.2 K and 108.3 K, and hence fulfil the alloy design requirements.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Shape Memory Alloys, Fe-based Shape Memory Alloys, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), High damping capacity, High transformation temperatures.','MME OFFICE','mmoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/fjf-ibsh-uyf','','',1,'2024-07-05 09:56:39','Active'),(812,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Studies on optical and electrical properties of layered Î±-Molybdenum trioxide ','Mr. RAVINDRA KUMAR, (PH17D204)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide(s): Dr. RAMACHANDRA RAO M S & Dr. PRAMODA KUMAR NAYAK','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/07/06 14:30','2024-07-06','yes','https://meet.google.com/izb-ygrq-aie','Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), a sub-class of more general two-dimensional (2D) materials, have emerged as an ideal platform for the study of many-body complexes because of strong light-matter interaction [1]. These low-dimensional materials exhibit a strong Coulomb interaction owing to reduced dielectric screening, resulting in stable excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) at room temperature [1,2]. In this work, we have studied the 2D oxide material Î±-MoO3 and its heterostructure with other TMDC materials. Our primary objective is to investigate many-body complexes, such as excitons and trions, for excitonic-based device applications. The Î±-MoO3 is a unique 2D oxide semiconductor that has recently gained immense potential in the field of optoelectronics because of its high workfunction (~6.0â€‰eV) and band gap (~3.0 eV) [3]. A large workfunction enables spontaneous electron transfer from most 2D materials to Î±-MoO3 in a heterostructure design, making Î±-MoO3 a viable candidate for designing self-driven photodetectors and hole transport layers in solar cells [3]. Our initial study was devoted to examining the charge transfer in the Î±-MoO3/MoS2 heterostructure and the subsequent formation of positive trions composed of one electron and two holes at low temperatures [4]. These trions are electrically controllable and contain information about energy, charge, and spin  [1]. In the next part of the work, we utilized H+-ion irradiation to tune the photoluminescence (PL) emission of Î±-MoO3 in a visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum  [5]. In addition, we have observed that the as-grown Î±-MoO3 crystals exhibit strong in-plane Raman anisotropy due to their low symmetric crystal structure. Furthermore, in-plane Raman anisotropy has been characterized by angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy, and the degree of anisotropy in Î±-MoO3 is quantified, which will be helpful for designing polarization-sensitive photonic devices. In the Final part of the work, we demonstrated the selective tuning of memristive characteristics of Î±-MoO3 through synthesizing two distinct single crystal types (referred to as type-I&II) using the physical vapor deposition technique.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1]	T.

The present work models the dip coating flows on saturated porous substrates in a biphasic configuration wherein two immiscible Newtonian liquids are simultaneously entrained. The model accounts for the effect of substrate permeability by using Darcyâ€™s law modified Navier slip boundary condition. New scaling laws have been derived for two interface heights in no-slip and strong-slip limits. Numerical solutions to the mathematical model predict that the presence of outer liquid reduces the effect of slip experienced by the inner liquid in the present configuration compared to that in the monophasic configuration. This reduction of wall-slip effect is found to be amplified by increasing the interfacial tension. Moreover, the inner film thickness becomes independent of substrate surface permeability at high values of rescaled capillary numbers. Interestingly, the substrate permeability induces thickening effect on the outer liquid film at high values of permeability factor and viscosity ratios. Process regime maps for inner and outer film thickness with permeability factor, withdrawal speed, and viscosity ratio have also been constructed.\r\n\r\nThe present work also addresses a theoretical understanding of morphological pattern formation in particulate coatings due to fluid instabilities and thermal treatment. The problem consists of modelling entrainment of dissimilar density pigments in a dip coating configuration. A simplified form of the Maxey-Riley formulation has been adopted. Results suggest that there exists a small parameter space wherein particle density gains significance. A regime map has also been constructed for particulate entrainment in the industrially relevant parameter space.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Dip coating, porous solids, Multilayer coatings, Capillarity, Navier slip, Landau-Levich problem, Maxey-Riley formulation, colloidal suspension, substrate patterning.\r\n','Dr. Sreeram K.

When 2\r\n\r\nwt% ZrH2 micropowders were added to pure Ag-Cu eutectic alloy paste, the Ag-Cu-\r\n2Zr filler did not wet the cBN, primarily due to the lack of Zr diffusion toward the cBN.\r\n\r\nZr atoms struggle to diffuse through the alloy due to factors such as the lower activity\r\ncoefficient of Zr in Ag-Cu, its larger atomic size, and higher mass compared to Ti, which is commonly used as an active element. Pin-on-disc tribo-test showed that the\r\nwear performance of the Ag-Cu-2Zr filler was 41% better than that of the Ag-Cu-2Ti\r\nfiller. To enhance wetting of cBN while retaining the excellent wear resistance of Zr,\r\nsmall percentages of Ti (1 and 2 wt%) were added to Ag-Cu-2Zr. Majority of Ti reacted\r\nwith the Cu in the alloy to form intermetallics and resulted in an inadequate wetting. A\r\ncombination of 4 wt% Ti and 4 wt% Zr was employed to achieve both wetting and\r\n\r\nimproved wear resistance. Interfacial analysis showed segregation of Ti at the cBN-\r\nfiller interface, while presence of Zr was less pronounced which was confirmed by\r\n\r\nXRD. The wear performance of Ag-Cu-4Zr-4Ti filler was observed to be 46% better\r\nthan the Ag-Cu-2Ti filler boasting a 24% improvement in microhardness. A single grit\r\nshear test was indigenously developed to evaluate joint strength of the brazed bond.\r\nAg-Cu-4Zr-4Ti could resist a load of 17.43 N before failure, making it suitable for\r\ngrinding processes at medium aggressive conditions.\r\n\r\nThe idea of achieving a wear resistant filler is always desirable and therefore addition\r\nof ceramic reinforcements was attempted to improve the mechanical properties of the\r\nAg-Cu-2Ti alloy. Addition of nano-Alumina particles to Ag-Cu-2Ti filler resulted in\r\npoor wear resistance due to particle agglomeration. The filler didnâ€™t wet cBN\r\neffectively, thus hindering the brazing process. Therefore, reinforcements addition in\r\nits microparticle size to the Ag-Cu-2Ti was explored by adding Î¼Al2O3 particles (APS\r\n10 Î¼m) to the Ag-Cu-2Ti filler in varying weight percentages (1 to 5%). EDS results\r\nrevealed formation of a critical intermetallic among the three elements (Cu-Ti-O),\r\nwhose stoichiometric ratio was later experimentally ascertained via SAED pattern as\r\nCu3Ti3O. Microhardness values showed a reduced trend compared to the Ag-Cu-2Ti\r\nfiller, but the presence of Cu3Ti3O phase increased bulk nanohardness. Wear resistance improved with Î¼Al2O3 particle addition, with Ag-Cu-2Ti-5Î¼Al2O3 filler displaying the\r\nhighest wear resistance. A high-speed impact test was employed to test the joint strength\r\nof the cBN brazed with Ag-Cu-2Ti-5Î¼Al2O3 filler in addition to the formerly designed\r\ntest for the joint strength, a low impact test. It showed that the grits were held intact by\r\nthe filler and no grit pullout was noticed. However, unwanted critical level of porosity\r\nin the filler region was observed. Thereafter, Î¼TiN and Î¼TiB2 particles were added as\r\nreinforcements to the filler, since these compounds are the direct byproduct during the\r\nTi reaction with cBN during brazing. Microstructural analysis showed uniform\r\ndistribution of ceramic particles in the filler. Î¼TiB2-reinforced fillers showed higher\r\nhardness and wear resistance when compared to the Î¼TiN-reinforced filler with Î¼TiB2-\r\nreinforced fillers exhibiting a 91-95% increase over the Ag-Cu-2Ti filler. The\r\neffectiveness of the Î¼TiB2-reinforced fillers was also evaluated by both the high and\r\nlow speed impact joint strength test. Considering the overall impact of the Î¼TiB2\r\naddition to the Ag-Cu-2Ti filler with its significant contribution to the performance\r\nenhancement of the alloy, Ag-Cu-2Ti-5Î¼TiB2 filler seemed to be the suitable brazing\r\nfiller for high performance grinding tools. With the formulated fillers, single layer\r\ngrinding wheel with regularized grit patterning was made, which was designed to\r\neliminate unfavorable agglomeration of grits and to facilitate better chip removal during\r\nhigh MRR grinding. A semi-automatic grit placement setup was developed to place the\r\ngrits in a predefined grit pattern. A high-speed grinding test rig was developed to\r\nevaluate the performance of patterned single-layer brazed cBN wheels. Commercially\r\nbrazed wheels were compared with the best of the reinforced fillers, Ag-Cu-2Ti-5Î¼TiB2\r\nfiller. Both types of wheels performed similarly in moderate grinding conditions.\r\nSimultaneously, the effect of advanced PVD coating on the filler was also studied.  A HiPIMS deposited TiAlN coating was chosen owing to their high wear resistance\r\ncharacteristics and prevalent usage among industries for the current study. The coating\r\nof TiAlN on brazed cBN wheel, produced with Ti-activated eutectic Ag-Cu alloy,\r\ndemonstrated improved performance, reduced grit pullout, and lower surface roughness\r\ncompared to both the commercial and reinforced filler brazed cBN wheels. Coated\r\nwheels alone performed well in aggressive grinding conditions. The coating shows\r\npromise for enhancing cBN wheel performance in aggressive grinding applications.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the study reveals that a HiPIMS deposited PVD coating such as TiAlN\r\non cBN wheel is more effective than adding reinforcements to the filler for improving\r\nwheel performance for aggressive grinding conditions. However, reinforcement\r\naddition may play a significant role in increasing tool life in moderate grinding\r\nconditions due to their superior mechanical properties.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','KEYWORDS: novel Ag-Cu composite fillers, single layer brazed cBN wheels, interfacial compounds, ther','','',1,'2024-07-05 12:13:46','Active'),(817,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Coupled Hydro-mechanical Behaviour in Clay-rich Caprock during Carbon Dioxide Geosequestration','Mr. Kumbamutlang War, Roll No. CE17D010','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. Dali Naidu Arnepalli - Guide, Dr. Subhadeep Banerjee - DC Member, Dr. Atul Narayan S P - DC Member, Dr. Rajnish Kumar (CH) - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE ','Civil Engineering','2024/07/09 09:00','2024-07-09','yes','BSB 104 , Conference Room','','Manikandan R, CE Office','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-06 08:10:13','Active'),(818,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Surface Engineering of Graphene and their Application as Catalyst Support for Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Fuel Cells','Ms. Rashmi B (CH18D400), PhD Research Scholar','PhD Research Scholar, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Madras','Chairperson: Dr. Ravi Krishna R, CH; Examiners: Dr. Raman Vedarajan, CFCT, ARCI, Dr. Sreenivas Jayanti, CH; Guide: Dr. Raghuram Chetty, CH.','Chemical Engineering','2024/07/08 16:30','2024-07-08','','Online: Google Meet','The unprecedented momentum gained by the hydrogen economy in recent years has brought back Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) into the limelight.

Here biogas is homogeneously pre-mixed with\r\nair and compressed while a small amount of diesel is injected directly at an appropriate\r\nearly timing (between 50 to 90Â° bTDC) during compression. The proportion of these\r\nfuels and the injection timing of the diesel control the reactivity and homogeneity for\r\ncombustion to be optimized Use of conventional Wide spray angle Injectors (WI) for\r\nthe early injection of diesel in RCCI engines results in its impingement on the cylinder\r\nwall leading to poor mixture preparation, dilution of the lubricating oil, soot, unburned\r\nhydrocarbon (HC) emissions and low efficiency. Narrow spray angle Injectors (NI) can\r\navoid this problem. However, biogas diesel RCCI engines will also require a late diesel\r\ninjection near TDC for proper combustion control using a WI.\r\nIn the first phase of this work a twin injector concept for utilizing biogas in the\r\nRCCI mode along with diesel was developed through CFD studies and experiments.\r\nAn additional common rail injector with a narrow angle between the sprays (NI) was\r\nspecially developed and employed for the early injection of diesel, while the\r\nconventional WI was used for injections near TDC. A turbocharged two cylinder\r\ncommon rail diesel engine was modified with two diesel fuel rails and a special open\r\nengine control software and hardware. CFD studies helped design the angle and\r\norientation of the sprays of the NI and ranges of injection timings and diesel quantities.\r\nExperiments were then conducted in the combined Narrow Wide RCCI (NW RCCI) mode and the results were compared with that of the Wide only RCCI (WI RCCI) and\r\nthe Conventional Dual Fuel (CDF) mode at BMEPs of 3 bar, 5 bar and 7 bar. NW RCCI\r\nmode resulted in very high efficiency and low NOx in the above range. The most\r\nsuitable injection pressure was 640 bar, start of injection of the NI was 900 bTDC and\r\nthe injection duration of NI was 275 Î¼s for best overall performance. The most suitable\r\nrange of injection timings and biogas shares were identified for different biogas shares\r\nand BMEPs.\r\nIn order to extend the BMEP range of RCCI operation, a combustion mode\r\nswitching concept was developed. Here a special master slave control strategy was\r\nconceptualized, implemented and demonstrated on an in-house developed control\r\nsystem. This enabled switching between CDC (conventional Diesel Combustion),\r\nbiogas diesel CDF and biogas diesel NW RCCI modes seamlessly depending on the\r\nload conditions while maximizing biogas utilization. Stability of the load, actual load\r\nand rate of change of load were used as the criteria while speed was also governed\r\nsimultaneously.\r\nIn the next phase a method of utilizing biogas in the RCCI mode along with another\r\nrenewable fuel of high reactivity namely Dimethyl Ether (DME) was developed. The\r\npossibility of utilizing biogas itself to produce DME makes this option relevant.\r\nExperimental studies at BMEPs of 3 bar and 5 bar proved that this mode of operation\r\ncan tolerate variations in the composition of biogas with higher BTE, very low NOx\r\nand soot. At a BMEP of 3 bar this method of operation referred to as DMB-RCCI gave\r\nnear zero NOx while that of Diesel Biogas Conventional Dual Fuel (DIB-CDF) and\r\nNW RCCI were 6.6 g/kWh and 0.9 g/kWh respectively. Similar was the case with soot\r\nwhere ultra-low values were obtained in the case of DMB-RCCI against the high value of 0.265 FSN obtained in the case of NW RCCI. The DIB-CDF mode also produced\r\nvery low soot. In the case of the BMEP of 5 bar, the same trend was observed.\r\nOn the whole, the experiments and simulation studies revealed the benefits of\r\nthe biogas diesel NW RCCI concept (in terms of high efficiency and low NOx\r\nemissions) developed in this work that mitigated the cylinder wall wetting problem.\r\nThe control methodology that was realized and demonstrated was capable of switching\r\nmodes between NW RCCI, CDF and CDC in real time and in a seamless manner for\r\nextending the BMEP range. Finally it was demonstrated through experiments that DME\r\nwhich is a renewable fuel can be used to enhance the reactivity of biogas in the RCCI\r\nmode with ultra-low NOx, soot, high thermal efficiency and low THC and CH4\r\nemissions for decentralized power generation.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/qpb-hjcj-ein','','',1,'2024-07-08 01:17:07','Active'),(821,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Transcritical CO2 heat pump and refrigeration systems for Indian applications','Mr. A M Guruchethan, Roll No. ME17D040','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide - Prof(retd).

The transconductorâ€™s output current polarity has to be switched in a small fraction of the reference cycle. The duration spent in each polarity determines one of the critical parameters of the loop gain and influences stability. Because the transconductance value required is small, fast switching is challenging. This difficulty is compounded by the high DC gain requirement, which forces the use of gain-boosting cascodes. Realizing the transconductor using small bias currents results in slow switching. High bias currents for faster switching and reducing the transconductance by attenuation or partial cancellation significantly increase the excess noise factor. This work proposes a topology for the gain-boosting opamp that improves the switching time while reducing the excess noise factor. The phase noise contribution of the transconductor in a sub-sampling PLL is inversely proportional to the phase detector gain. The phase detector gain decreases with a shift in the zero crossings of the driving waveform and feedthrough in the sampling switches. This work modifies the layout of the sampling switches to reduce the feedthrough and the driving circuit to maintain the operating point within tighter bounds.

The research work in the thesis aims to develop an optimal bidding strategy for effective coordination of WPP and pumped storage hydro plants (PSHPs) in day-ahead energy market as well as frequency ancillary services like spinning reserve (SR) and fast responsive reserve (FRR). The coordinated operation of PSHPs with WPPs decreases the intermittent effects of wind power supplied to the grid. The revenue obtained from participating in SR and FRR are compared. The research work conducted in this thesis also considered various scenarios to account for uncertainties in WPP output. Subsequently, a joint double auction bidding strategy is developed for WPP to coordinate PSHPs and demand response (DR) programs. This joint strategy aimed to reduce the imbalances between cleared wind power in the day-ahead market and actual output. For this purpose, curtailable, shiftable, and incremental loads are incorporated into the DR programs. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the research work conducted in this thesis focuses on reactive power ancillary services to maintain voltage regulation at buses and reduce transmission losses. Modeling and simulation of the 765 kV, 400 kV, and 220 kV grids in Andhra Pradesh (AP), a state in India, are performed using DigSILENT PowerFactory software. The evolution of the AP grid from 2013 to 2019 is analyzed based on the percentage of renewable energy integration. A key objective is regulating substation voltages, controlling network losses, and improving voltage profiles. Furthermore, strategically locating variable shunt reactors at critical substations reduces reactive energy exchange charges from the utility to the power pool. \r\n\r\nFinally, a decentralized and distributed framework utilizing the Ethereum blockchain is developed for automatic electricity trading within independent microgrids, eliminating the need for a central aggregator or distribution system operator (DSO). This trading environment leveraged smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Each prosumer with an EVM and smart meter is considered a node equipped with a smart contract to submit demand quantities following a communication protocol. After collecting demands, the nodes exchange primal and dual variables using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The EVM retrieved energy records from smart meters for energy dispatch and monetary settlements among consumers upon convergence.\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/wsf-ncyg-kgx','','',1,'2024-07-08 04:11:15','Active'),(828,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- வட்டி  (vaddi)\r\nHindi word	- ब्याज (byaaj)\r\nEnglish word	- Interest\r\n','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-08 04:46:55','default_value'),(829,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Molecular Evolution of GPCRs: Evolutionary History of Histamine, Muscarinic, Apelin and Prokineticin Receptors','Infant Sagayaraj Ravhe D (BT13D025)','PhD scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Dr. Manoj Narayanan (BT)','Department of Biotechnology','2024/07/10 15:30','2024-07-10','','BT Seminar Hall','G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of membrane proteins with conserved seven transmembrane helical structures. GPCRs play a vital role in various important physiological processes making them drug targets for about 30% of the commercially available therapeutics. Among the 800 GPCRs in humans, about 150 are known to be expressed in the heart. Here we carried out molecular evolutionary studies of the histamine, muscarinic, apelin and prokineticin receptors which are key regulators of diverse signaling pathways leading to coronary vascular smooth muscle movement, myocardial hypertrophy, coronary repair and pacemaker activity. \r\nMolecular evolution provides a powerful toolkit for exploring the evolutionary history of proteins, allowing inference of their relationships with other homologs through phylogeny and comparative genomics approaches. Comprehending their evolutionary history is crucial for predicting relationships within large protein families and can yield important insights, such as identifying orthologous and paralogous proteins, detecting conservation patterns and features, pinpointing functionally important sites, revealing the history of ancient duplication events that led to emergence of species-specific homologs and subtypes, and understanding their structure-function implications.\r\nOur analyses on histamine receptors support a revised classification of the vertebrate H3-H4 receptor subtypes. We demonstrate the presence of the H4 across vertebrates, contradicting the currently held notion that H4 is restricted to mammals and identified a novel H3B in addition to the canonical H3A subtype in vertebrates. Analysis on muscarinic receptors reveals the emergence of muscarinic mediated GPCR signaling by mAChR-A in a prebilaterian and that the mAChR-B, H1 and H3 histamine receptors emerged by a local gene duplication from an ancestral mAChR-A in a bilaterian ancestor. Moreover, the vertebrate specific M1-M5 subtypes evolved as an outcome of the vertebrate whole genome duplication (WGD) events. Analysis on APLNR suggested that the APLNR1/2, GPR15, GPR25, and angiotensin receptors (AGTR1/2) are paralogs that shared the most recent common ancestor in a basal vertebrate. We propose that these six paralogous receptors are ohnologous products of the vertebrate WGD. Next, our analysis supports the emergence of prokineticin receptors in the deuterostomes. We identified a novel prokineticin receptor subtype PKR3 and confirmed that the vertebrate PKR1 and PKR3 are outcomes of the WGD event. An analysis on the peptide ligands of the prokineticin receptor indicate an evolutionary history that paralleled the receptors. In summary, the evolutionary history of these receptors reveals interesting patterns of orthology/paralogy from several phylogenetically informative lineages. Our analysis will advance the understanding of these systems relevant to their pharmacological roles and help delineate how they have evolved to act together to regulate crucial physiological processes.\r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-08 04:51:03','Active'),(830,'seminar','Technical Talk','NULL','Testing','SAK','SAK','sak','cc','2024/07/09 11:09','2024-07-09','','cc','','SAK','sanand@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-08 05:39:42','Active'),(831,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Development of a Micro-Turning Machine for Intelligent Performance Prediction in Ti-6Al-4V Alloy Machining Using Textured Inserts','Mr. Tere Rajesh Babu (ME17D019)','PhD, Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering\r\n','Guide Name: Prof. GL Samuel, ME / DC members: Dr. Somashekhar S.

This dissertation addresses a key challenge in CO2 based EOR â€“ the low viscosity of CO2 compared to reservoir oil, leading to viscous fingering and reduced sweep efficiency. The research explores two areas: CO2 thickener design and simulations of the huff-n-puff process. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to identify promising thickener candidates. By benchmarking forcefields and analyzing interaction energies, viscosity, and synthesizability, molecules with cyclic cores emerged as frontrunners due to favorable ðœ‹ âˆ’ ðœ‹ interactions enhancing viscosity.\r\nFurther, to optimise the molecular search from a near infinite space of  possibilities but limited data from experiments, a novel framework combining artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms with MD simulations was developed for thickener design. This framework successfully generated over 1000 potential molecules with promising viscosity enhancement compared to pure CO2.\r\nMolecular dynamics simulations were further employed to investigate the effectiveness of the top few thickeners in the huff-n-puff process across the systems of calcite slab, narrow nanopore and a wide nanopore mimicking the industrial process. The simulations demonstrated significant oil recovery improvement, particularly in narrow pores, attributed to reduced oil viscosity and enhanced gas solubility. Overall, this research paves the way for the development and practical implementation of CO2 thickeners, ultimately leading to a more efficient, sustainable, and environmentally responsible approach to oil recovery.','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkONLINE:  https://meet.google.com/tre-wyde-tna','seminar08-07-2024 08:59','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar08-07-2024 08:59',1,'2024-07-08 08:59:33','Active'),(834,'seminar','Technical Talk','NULL','Testing','sak','sak','sak','cc','2024/07/09 15:31','2024-07-09','','cc201','','Anandkumar S','sanand@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-08 10:02:02','Active'),(835,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Exploring neuron degeneration through transcriptome studies on Huntingtonâ€™s disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis','Nela Pragathi Sneha (BT18D019)','Ph.D. Research Scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Prof. M Michael Gromiha','Department of Biotechnology','2024/07/11 11:00','2024-07-11','','Google Meet','Neurodegenerative disorders are the second leading cause of death globally with 9 million deaths per year. The neuronal death in major parts of the brain is a clinical feature of these diseases. The reason behind this neural cell loss is still not clear. In Huntingtonâ€™s Disease (HD), striatal medium spiny projection neurons are more vulnerable to cell death. In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS), upper and lower motor neurons are lost in the initial stages of the disease and diminish as the disease progresses. Transcriptomic analysis with prediction of therapeutic targets and pathways may increase understanding of neuronal loss. \r\nOur study explored transcriptomic data obtained from Brodmann Area 9, Brodmann Area 4 for HD, and the spinal cord along with the frontal cortex for ALS, and identified variants and differentially expressed genes from these regions. The variants obtained from these studies affect the binding of transcription of factors, miRNA and also modulate epigenetic alterations. Through our comprehensive multi-omic analysis, we propose that genes involved in neuroinflammatory signalling have a detrimental impact on neuronal survival and significantly affect motor neuronal functionality. These genes can disrupt vascular integrity, leading to compromised blood flow and nutrient supply to the brain. Additionally, they can affect energy metabolism processes, further impairing the proper functioning of motor neurons. From the results, we propose that abnormal neuroinflammation acts as a two-edged sword that indirectly affects the vasculature and associated energy metabolism. Rehabilitation of blood-brain barrier functionality and energy metabolism may secure the neuron from cell death. For ALS transcriptome study, we quantified gene and transcript expression patterns along with functional consequences of the genes. Our analysis includes the prediction of variant-associated regulatory effects, the construction of function interaction networks, and gene enrichment analysis. Interestingly, we found that frontal cortex and spinal cord genes are likely to be involved in metabolic pathways and immune response activities. From this integrative approach, we propose that genes expressed in immune cells of the brain and metabolic pathways are crucial for avoiding neuron decline in ALS.\r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','Publications: 1.

Manipulating bubble behavior, notably through externally applied electric fields, holds significant promise for various applications. The present study focuses on establishing a foundational understanding of bubble rising under the influence of an electric field. To conduct simulations, we developed an in-house electrohydrodynamic solver integrated with interFoam, an open-source finite volume method (FVM) within the OpenFOAM framework. The solver is meticulously validated against the literature and found to be robust in calculating electrical force and capturing interface in the presence of the electric field. In the absence of an electric field, a small spherical bubble exhibits various shapes, including ellipsoidal, ellipsoidal cap, bi-oblate, dimpled ellipsoidal, or retains its original spherical form. The study is divided into two main parts: examining the effect of an electric field on a bubble rising while maintaining a sph erical shape and exploring the impact of an electric field on the ascent of non-spherical steady-state bubbles. In the first part, with fixed hydrodynamic parameters, we investigated the influence of electrical parameters such as conductivity ratio(R), permittivity ratio(S), and electric capillary number (CaE). The electrical force, comprising dielectrophoretic force and Coulomb force, increases with higher values of CaE, R, and S. The ascent of bubbles leads to various phenomena, including wall-attached bubbles, path instability, and breakup, influenced by the strength and direction of vortices induced by electrical force. The strength and direction of the vortices depend upon the property ratios R and S. In the second part, while keeping electrical property ratios constant, we varied hydrodynamic parameters to attain various bubble shapes. The study revealed that higher CaE values induce wobbling in different steady-state bubble shapes. The CaE minimally affects the rising velocit y but significantly influences deformation for specific shapes - ellipsoidal and ellipsoidal cap. The overall impact of Bond number (Bo) and Reynolds number (Re) on bubble dynamics in the presence of an electric field mirrors their effects in its absence, except for wobbling, which is observed at lower Bo and Re values.','HoD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/aqj-whpq-dtn','','',1,'2024-07-08 11:59:07','Active'),(840,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Development and performance evaluation of brazed single layer cBN wheels produced with novel fillers and new generation hard coating','Mr. RAGHAVA SIMHAN D (ME15D211)','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide - Prof. Amitava Ghosh, ME, IITM','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/07/09 10:00','2024-07-09','yes','Through Google Meet:  https://meet.google.com/jtg-gszh-rgd','Brazed cBN grinding wheels have gained significant attention in grinding industries\r\nowing to their excellent performance capabilities and the growing demand for grinding\r\nhigh strength alloys. Current work aims at developing new generation single layer cBN\r\ngrinding tools for high MRR applications with focus on its braze bond performance\r\nwhile having a defined grit positioning at its periphery. The longer and thicker chips\r\nproduced at high depth grinding of harder materials poses major challenge to the bond\r\nwherein the abrasion of the brazed bond will be severe. Existing literatures indicate that\r\nthe commonly used Ag-Cu brazing filler alloys for joining cBN to metal substrate are\r\nquite soft and have poor mechanical properties. The alloys are however known for their\r\nexcellent flowability, appearance and low melting point. Strengthening the bond is\r\ntherefore critical. Improving the filler properties will substantially promote the practice\r\nof heavy stock removal using advanced grinding tools.\r\n\r\nThis study investigates the effect of Zr as an active element in Ag-Cu brazing filler\r\nalloy for joining cBN (cubic boron nitride) to medium carbon steel substrate. When 2\r\n\r\nwt% ZrH2 micropowders were added to pure Ag-Cu eutectic alloy paste, the Ag-Cu-\r\n2Zr filler did not wet the cBN, primarily due to the lack of Zr diffusion toward the cBN.\r\n\r\nZr atoms struggle to diffuse through the alloy due to factors such as the lower activity\r\ncoefficient of Zr in Ag-Cu, its larger atomic size, and higher mass compared to Ti, which is commonly used as an active element. Pin-on-disc tribo-test showed that the\r\nwear performance of the Ag-Cu-2Zr filler was 41% better than that of the Ag-Cu-2Ti\r\nfiller. To enhance wetting of cBN while retaining the excellent wear resistance of Zr,\r\nsmall percentages of Ti (1 and 2 wt%) were added to Ag-Cu-2Zr. Majority of Ti reacted\r\nwith the Cu in the alloy to form intermetallics and resulted in an inadequate wetting. A\r\ncombination of 4 wt% Ti and 4 wt% Zr was employed to achieve both wetting and\r\n\r\nimproved wear resistance. Interfacial analysis showed segregation of Ti at the cBN-\r\nfiller interface, while presence of Zr was less pronounced which was confirmed by\r\n\r\nXRD. The wear performance of Ag-Cu-4Zr-4Ti filler was observed to be 46% better\r\nthan the Ag-Cu-2Ti filler boasting a 24% improvement in microhardness. A single grit\r\nshear test was indigenously developed to evaluate joint strength of the brazed bond.\r\nAg-Cu-4Zr-4Ti could resist a load of 17.43 N before failure, making it suitable for\r\ngrinding processes at medium aggressive conditions.\r\n\r\nThe idea of achieving a wear resistant filler is always desirable and therefore addition\r\nof ceramic reinforcements was attempted to improve the mechanical properties of the\r\nAg-Cu-2Ti alloy. Addition of nano-Alumina particles to Ag-Cu-2Ti filler resulted in\r\npoor wear resistance due to particle agglomeration. The filler didnâ€™t wet cBN\r\neffectively, thus hindering the brazing process. Therefore, reinforcements addition in\r\nits microparticle size to the Ag-Cu-2Ti was explored by adding Î¼Al2O3 particles (APS\r\n10 Î¼m) to the Ag-Cu-2Ti filler in varying weight percentages (1 to 5%). EDS results\r\nrevealed formation of a critical intermetallic among the three elements (Cu-Ti-O),\r\nwhose stoichiometric ratio was later experimentally ascertained via SAED pattern as\r\nCu3Ti3O. Microhardness values showed a reduced trend compared to the Ag-Cu-2Ti\r\nfiller, but the presence of Cu3Ti3O phase increased bulk nanohardness. Wear resistance\r\nimproved with Î¼Al2O3 particle addition, with Ag-Cu-2Ti-5Î¼Al2O3 filler displaying the\r\nhighest wear resistance. A high-speed impact test was employed to test the joint strength\r\nof the cBN brazed with Ag-Cu-2Ti-5Î¼Al2O3 filler in addition to the formerly designed\r\ntest for the joint strength, a low impact test. It showed that the grits were held intact by\r\nthe filler and no grit pullout was noticed. However, unwanted critical level of porosity\r\nin the filler region was observed. Thereafter, Î¼TiN and Î¼TiB2 particles were added as\r\nreinforcements to the filler, since these compounds are the direct byproduct during the\r\nTi reaction with cBN during brazing. Microstructural analysis showed uniform\r\ndistribution of ceramic particles in the filler. Î¼TiB2-reinforced fillers showed higher\r\nhardness and wear resistance when compared to the Î¼TiN-reinforced filler with Î¼TiB2-\r\nreinforced fillers exhibiting a 91-95% increase over the Ag-Cu-2Ti filler. The\r\neffectiveness of the Î¼TiB2-reinforced fillers was also evaluated by both the high and\r\nlow speed impact joint strength test. Considering the overall impact of the Î¼TiB2\r\naddition to the Ag-Cu-2Ti filler with its significant contribution to the performance\r\nenhancement of the alloy, Ag-Cu-2Ti-5Î¼TiB2 filler seemed to be the suitable brazing\r\nfiller for high performance grinding tools. With the formulated fillers, single layer\r\ngrinding wheel with regularized grit patterning was made, which was designed to\r\neliminate unfavorable agglomeration of grits and to facilitate better chip removal during\r\nhigh MRR grinding. A semi-automatic grit placement setup was developed to place the\r\ngrits in a predefined grit pattern. A high-speed grinding test rig was developed to\r\nevaluate the performance of patterned single-layer brazed cBN wheels. Commercially\r\nbrazed wheels were compared with the best of the reinforced fillers, Ag-Cu-2Ti-5Î¼TiB2\r\nfiller. Both types of wheels performed similarly in moderate grinding conditions.\r\nSimultaneously, the effect of advanced PVD coating on the filler was also studied. A HiPIMS\r\ndeposited TiAlN coating was chosen owing to their high wear resistance\r\ncharacteristics and prevalent usage among industries for the current study. The coating\r\nof TiAlN on brazed cBN wheel, produced with Ti-activated eutectic Ag-Cu alloy,\r\ndemonstrated improved performance, reduced grit pullout, and lower surface roughness\r\ncompared to both the commercial and reinforced filler brazed cBN wheels. Coated\r\nwheels alone performed well in aggressive grinding conditions. The coating shows\r\npromise for enhancing cBN wheel performance in aggressive grinding applications.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the study reveals that a HiPIMS deposited PVD coating such as TiAlN\r\non cBN wheel is more effective than adding reinforcements to the filler for improving\r\nwheel performance for aggressive grinding conditions. However, reinforcement\r\naddition may play a significant role in increasing tool life in moderate grinding\r\nconditions due to their superior mechanical properties.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','KEYWORDS: novel Ag-Cu composite fillers, single layer brazed cBN wheels, interfacial compounds, ther','','',1,'2024-07-09 02:02:13','Active'),(841,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL',' DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION OF THE METAL HYDRIDE BASED HYDROGEN STORAGE REACTORS','Mr. Kalikiri Venkata Krishna (ME19D022)','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide - Prof(retd).

Solar energy can be one of the important contributors to this transition. Solar energy can be efficiently harvested by photoabsorbers and converted to electricity as well as stored as solar fuels like green hydrogen. The hydrogen can be generated by using a photo-catalyst which has favourable band positions to execute water splitting into HÂ¬2Â¬ and OÂ¬2Â¬Â¬. Halide perovskites can be potential candidates to act as photo-catalysts as it has low bandgap, panchromatic absorption, tunable bandgap, longer charge carrier lifetime. Also, the stability of photo-catalyst in aqueous mediums is crucial. The conventional halide perovskites (ABX3) (X = I, Br) which are reported for excellent photon to energy conversion faces stability issues in the presence of moisture, temperature and light. The degradation mechanism when the perovskites are exposed to moisture and temperature are well studied, however the light induced degradation mitigation is still an ongoing investigative research. We tried to understand the impact of various wavelengths such as 488 nm, 561 nm and 633 nm which signifies the visible region of light on the degradation of conventional halide perovskites. We observed a phenomenon called the \"Photo-Brightening\" effect where we see an enhancement in the photo-luminescence as the material is shined upon in different time intervals by various wavelengths. The photo-brightening effect quenched when the chemical composition was changed from iodide to bromide signifying that the photoluminescence enhancement was due to iodide ion migration due to the weak Pb-I bond. This ion migration causes a localized group of ions causing anomalies in the structure like creating photo-inactive localized phases causing recombination which is unfavorable for efficient photon to energy conversion. We also developed a stable class of halide perovskites called the vacancy ordered halide perovskites with AÂ¬2Â¬BXÂ¬6Â¬ structure where A-sites are monovalent cations, B-sites are quadrivalent cations and X are monovalent halide anions. Some of these developed materials were found to be extremely stable in ambient conditions for over a year and also possess good optoelectronic properties. Based upon these characteristics and suitable stability we employed these materials for photocatalysis.  A series of materials like CsÂ¬2Â¬RuXÂ¬6Â¬, CsÂ¬2Â¬PdXÂ¬6Â¬, CsÂ¬2Â¬OsXÂ¬6Â¬ , CsÂ¬2Â¬MnXÂ¬6Â¬  were developed and these materials were found to be stable in ambient conditions and some were stable in harsh pH conditions ranging from pH 1 to pH 11. These materials were also found to possess favorable band position for solar water oxidation thereby giving us a class of materials that can serve as excellent photoabsorbers for solar energy conversion.','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/itm-qpmq-uxsâ€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬','seminar09-07-2024 03:11','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar09-07-2024 03:11',1,'2024-07-09 03:11:34','Active'),(845,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Improving Flood inundation mapping and Modeling using microwave satellite imageries and Hydraulic Models',' Mr. Swarnadeep Mukherjee, Roll No: CE20S012','M.S Scholar','Dr. Balaji Narasimhan - Guide, Dr. Soumendra Nath Kuiry - Co -Guide, Dr. B.S.

This research explores the AM of metallic materials, focusing on both low and high-melting-point alloys.\r\n\r\nA cost-effective setup using the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technique was developed to deposit Sn-3Ag solder material. By varying parameters like nozzle temperature, print bed temperature, and print bed material, the study aimed to replicate conditions similar to high-energy beam-based techniques. This helped in understanding how adjusting these parameters can achieve desired material properties.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) technique was used to study Inconel 718. Using manufacturer-recommended parameters, nearly uniform mechanical properties were achieved in the as-deposited material and retained through heat treatments. Fracture analysis indicated ductile behavior and texture analysis showed that a cube texture formed during deposition remained even after heat treatment. Thus, factors like laser energy density and scan strategy are vital for tailoring the microstructure.\r\n\r\nThe study also used Phase Field Modeling to understand how microstructure evolves in LPBF of Inconel 718. Simulations showed that changing laser power and domain size can produce near-equiaxed grain structures. The study provided detailed insights into grain nucleation, growth, and melt pool dynamics.\r\n\r\nOverall, this research offers insights into developing a low-cost AM setup for higher melting point alloys.

Customary laws have a significant influence in areas of traditional administration, marriage, divorce, and inheritance, where the law is often discriminatory in its application towards women in areas of bride price, appointment to positions of authority including leadership positions, inheritance of property, and child custody. Asking the â€˜woman questionâ€™ is integral to unearthing the obvious concerns women face in their interaction with the law and, more specifically, in uncovering gender implications of law that seemingly appear neutral. The â€˜woman questionâ€™ as a method can be used to interrogate existing laws that may be considered neutral but, on closer inspection, might reveal inconsistencies and embedded issues of gender, discernible only when the law is applied in its context (Anna Dziedzic 2020). This is especially crucial to understanding how Mizo customary law operates under context-specific circumstances, as customary law is deeply intertwined with the traditional norms of society. In the same vein, analysing the linkages between customary law and society is instrumental as the context on which the current legal rules are based cannot be divorced from Mizo society at large. Bartlett underlined various feminist legal methods, including the more conventional form of inductive and deductive legal reasoning, but focused her attention on alternative methods, namely the â€˜woman questionâ€™ and â€œconsciousness-raisingâ€, to expose issues in the legal system that could be overlooked by traditional methods (Bartlett, Feminist Legal Methods 1990, 837). The â€˜woman questionâ€™ can become a method when used to consistently pose questions and interrogate existing biases, including, but not limited to, gender implications of traditional norms and practices. The intersection of gender and law in society and how these issues interrelate in the legal discourse are politically and socially relevant in the context of gender disparity and violence against women. This debate is situated at the intersection of law, gender, tradition, and administrative autonomy and the study attempts to employ the â€œwoman questionâ€ as a method to critically examine customary law. It involves ethnographic observations, documentary analysis, case studies, and oral histories to understand the gap between theory and practice. The socio-legal bargains and administrative choices made under customary law draw attention to the need for the inclusion of traditional understandings of law in debates on legal reforms.','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/rib-dnvw-cpt','','',1,'2024-07-09 06:00:51','Active'),(848,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Advanced manipulation and control of elastic waves using topological metamaterials','Mohit Kumar','Mohit Kumar is currently a PhD research scholar at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University.

Precise control of elastic waves holds promise for new technological applications, including on-material computation and passively adaptive behavior. Such characteristics can be potentially achieved by the judicious design of periodic elastic structures, also known as elastic \"metamaterials\". Elastic metamaterials have already enabled exotic structural properties including negative Poisson\'s ratio and negative refraction index. However, given the vast design space, it is challenging to rationally design a metamaterial for a target property. A newer class of elastic metamaterials, called elastic \"topological\" metamaterials, provides a method to design for advanced wave control by leveraging concepts from the mathematical field of differential geometry and topology. Most notably, interfaces between two topological metamaterials support localized waves that propagate across sharp bends without leaking into the bulk. Although the field of elastic topological metamaterials has rapidly developed over the past decade, many technological applications and fundamental discoveries remain to be explored.\r\n\r\nThis talk will be divided into two parts. First, I will provide an overview of elastic topological metamaterials, covering the field\'s origins in physics, outlining key concepts, and presenting applications. Then, I will explain the underlying reasons for the unique properties of elastic topological metamaterials.

The dynamic analysis of a VBI system has been studied extensively by various researchers in the past with the interest of computing more accurate and rational values of bridge dynamic response and also due to enormous applications which were developed recently like â€“ indirect bridge health monitoring, moving load identification, system parameter identification, bridge vibration mitigation, bridge sensors energy harvesting, vehicle optimization and ride comfort study. The numerical modeling of the VBI system involves idealizations of vehicles, bridges, tires, and road roughness. Various numerical models have been developed in the literature. The vehicle can be modeled as a moving force model, moving mass model, quarter car model, half car model, and full car model. The bridge can be modeled as a beam model, plate model, grillage model, shell and beam model, and 3D solid element model. The tire and bridge contact can be modeled as a single-point contact model, multi-point contact model, or patch contact model, or solve the non-linear contact problem assuming the tire and bridge are rigid or deformable bodies. Now, with the availability of various models, it is crucial to know their applicability and accuracy. Hence, the current study addresses the significant questions of concern: What are the differences between the various VBI models? How does the model predict the field test measurement values for a given condition? Hence, finally, to arrive at the answer to the question, when should we use which model? In this seminar, a critical review of the literature on available VBI models, its comparative studies, and field validation studies will be discussed in detail to address the above questions of concern. Also, the general approaches to solving a VBI problem are discussed briefly.','R.

Ideally, the materials used for these applications should have properties such as an in-vivo trigger with desired mechanical strength and functionality in controlled drug release and controlling cell behavior. Existing materials used for some of these applications are metal alloys with polymer coating, which does not meet all the desired requirements.\r\nStimuli-responsive polymer thin films with engineered matrix characteristics can accomplish desirable shape-changing properties in response to external stimuli. Our work focuses on the use of solvent responsive biopolymer chitosan for biomedical applications. Since the human body consists of body fluids that exist in different forms and have different concentrations of electrolytes and metabolites with different physiological pH, it provides a considerable advantage to solvent-responsive polymers for various biomedical applications. These power-free actuators are highly promising in miniaturisation and controllability for systems used in drug delivery, microsurgery, implantable devices, etc.\r\nThe chitosan film has been shown to undergo actuation when placed on the surface of the solvent; however, it shows no actuation when placed inside the solvent. When the chitosan thin film is placed on the solvent surface, the solvent molecules diffuse into the polymer matrix from the bottom, creating a concentration gradient across the thickness, leading to out-of-plane bending of the film. However, diffusion occurs from all sides when the film is dipped inside the solvent. Thus, the concentration gradient is never developed for the actuation to occur. By making one side/surface of the Chitosan film wholly or partially restricting solvent diffusion, the concentration gradient across the thickness can be developed for actuation inside the solvent. The main challenge was designing bilayer-based asymmetric structures required for undersolvent actuation and perform necessary experiments to prove their suitability for biomedical applications.\r\n We have developed various strategies to attain asymmetric structures targeting specific application. The strategies include: a) layer-by-layer assembly of uncrosslinked and crosslinked Chitosan, b) layer-by-layer assembly of Carboxymethyl Cellulose(basic pH-responsive) and Chitosan(acidic pHresponsive), c) Self-assembly of superhydrophobic silica nanoparticles(top surface) with Chitosan(bottom surface), d) Spin coated hydrophobic Polymethyl Methacrylate(PMMA) layer on hydrophilic Chitosan film with superhydrophobic SiNPs layer at the interface. These mentioned strategies showcases the potential of solvent responsive actuators  in biomedical applications.','BT OFFICE','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','Publications: 1.

We provide new contextual bandit algorithms that utilize novel entropy-like measures that we introduce. We show theoretical results on the performance of our algorithms, including regret bounds. We also provide extensive experimental results demonstrating the improved performance of our algorithms compared to baselines.

However, their stability in aqueous medium is poor making them unsuitable to employ for direct water splitting. Various protective layers coupled with halide perovskite were utilized to prevent the exposure of the absorber to aqueous medium. However, these protective layers are susceptible to failure with prolonged operation. So, employing a water stable absorber material is found to be the key for successful photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. \r\nVacancy ordered double perovskites with the formula A2BX6 are a promising alternative to conventional ABX3 perovskites due to excellent stability, comparable absorption coefficient and bandgap tunability.

Furthermore, these materials exhibit absorption properties that encompass a substantial portion of visible light.

Therefore, understanding the deformation behaviour of these alloys over a wide range of temperatures, strain rates, and stress is imperative. Earlier studies have shown that inherent low stacking fault energy (SFE) leads to a distinct high-temperature deformation and creep behaviour at elevated temperatures (>0.3 Tm) in solid solution strengthened cobalt-base superalloys compared to the wrought Ni-base superalloys. Moreover, the microstructural characterization studies revealed the presence of temperature-dependent substructural features such as dislocation dipoles, stacking faults, and solute segregation near the partials (i.e., Suzuki segregation). However, the fundamental mechanism for the formation of these substructural features and their contribution towards deformation mechanisms is not elucidated. Thus, the present study aims to understand the substructure evolution in a solid solution strengthened Co-base superalloy Co-22Cr-22Ni-14W-2Fe-1.25Mn-0.1C over a wide range of temperatures (RT â€“ 0.9Tm ) and strain rate. As a part of this work, extensive mechanical testing was conducted at various strain rates (10-4 â€“ 10-1 s-1), stress levels (30 â€“ 500 MPa), and temperatures (RT â€“ 1200 Â°C). Further, detailed microstructural characterization studies were performed on the post-deformed and interrupted specimens using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). By correlating these findings with the deformation behaviour, the plausible region-wise deformation mechanisms are proposed and will be discussed in the seminar.','MME OFFICE','mmoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/ict-gxcg-vub','','',1,'2024-07-10 05:43:02','Active'),(857,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Experimental evaluation and numerical simulation of Carbon Epoxy Laminates and Conical Shells with embedded delamination','Mr. A Nagendranath','Ph.D. research scholar, Dept. of Applied Mechanics & Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras','Guide(s) - Dr. C Lakshmana Rao & Dr. R K Gupta (DRDO)','Department of Applied Mechanics & Biomedical Engineering','2024/07/11 16:00','2024-07-11','yes','Online meeting link: https://meet.google.com/hwj-srip-zof  ','Airframe construction in conical form is the most desired shape of flight hard- ware due to their low drag profile and are located at the fore-end region of flight vehicles encountering high drag loads. Owing to their tailoring capability, mate- rials with orthotropic mechanical properties are preferred choice. Presence of delamination causes reduction in strength and stiffness of laminated composite structure and detrimental to the safety and stability of structures made of com- posite materials. Determination of the residual strength and stiffness with re- spect to a finite size of delamination would be helpful in assessment of struc- tures fitness to usage whenever the defects are identified by non-destructive procedures. The study is carried out with building block approach i.e. on speci- men, laminate and component. Fracture tests have been carried out at specimen level for uni-directional plies and multi-directional plies representing edge de- lamination situation. Experiments of in-plane compression testing of multidirec- tional laminate with an embedded delamination at the centre are carried out. For the purpose of reference, tests of an ideal laminate without delamination are car- ried out. Stability studies under embedded delamination in orthotropic conical shells under axial load and external pressure load is performed. The effect of de- lamination size and itâ€™s through the thickness position on the stability of the cone shaped shell is investigated. The investigation is performed for metal and composite materials with 3 types of stacking sequences generally used in practi- cal designs. The normalized buckling factor is showed graphically with the normalized defect size. Drastic reduction in buckling capability with the local mode is observed when the defect location is close to the surface and more prominent for an outer surface case.

The wide utilization of several power electronic converters in the DC microgrid creates stability issues. The incremental negative impedance feature of constant power loads in the DC microgrid may destabilize the system and its significant presence might affect the dynamics of power electronic converters. This seminar presents the control schemes for a PV-Wind-Hybrid Energy Storage System based standalone DC microgrid with constant power loads. Hybrid energy storage system consisting of battery and supercapacitor are widely used to provide reliable power supply to the load. The supercapacitor having high power density absorbs the transient current components and thereby improves the life of the battery. A control scheme based on super-twisting control and modified super-twisting observer is proposed for the bidirectional converters of battery and supercapacitor. The implemented control scheme provides wider stability margin, better dynamic performance, and tightly regulates the DC bus voltage. The super-twisting sliding mode controller is also implemented to track the current reference obtained from the optimum torque control MPPT algorithm in a permanent magnet synchronous generator-based wind system. The relevant theoretical analyses and the efficacy of the control algorithms by simulation and experimental studies are presented in this seminar.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/dsg-torw-bgk','','',1,'2024-07-10 05:56:59','Active'),(859,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\"The Generation and Influence of Bimodal Î³Ê¹ Distribution on the Deformation Behavior of Alloy 718Plus Under Monotonic and Cyclic Loading\"','Mr. BARUN BHARADWAJ DASH (MM16D200)','Ph.D Scholar, Dept of MME.','Guide: Sankaran S , MME','Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering','2024/07/15 15:00','2024-07-15','yes','NAC 222 SEMINAR HALL','Nickel-based superalloys, strengthened by ordered intermetallic precipitates, show an excellent combination of physical and mechanical performance at high service temperatures. The newly developed gamma prime (Î³Ê¹) strengthened alloy, 718Plus, is considered a replacement for the current commercial superalloys used in turbine disk applications, owing to its high thermal stability and a good combination of formability and weldability. Tailored microstructures with modified particle size distribution and number density of the gamma prime (Î³Ê¹) precipitates can be generated by controlling the cooling rate and the extent of undercooling for precipitation. It is also well known that ï§ï‚¢ precipitate distribution can influence mechanical properties by altering the interaction between the precipitates and dislocations (mode of shearing or looping) and may improve mechanical response by delaying the movement of dislocation along slip bands. In the present work, various bimodal Î³Ê¹ distributions were generated through a novel interrupted aging treatment involving double-aging at 905Â°C and 710Â°C on a fully solutionized specimen (1050Â°C/1h) and varying ageing durations. Hardness measurement served as the basis for the identification of the peak-aged specimens. The large and fine Î³Ê¹ precipitates formed an almost 50:50% uniform distribution by volume fraction with particle sizes of 72 nm and 13 nm, respectively. The Î³/Î³Ê¹ lattice misfits obtained through HRTEM show high coherency with the large and fine Î³Ê¹ and were limited to 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. Co-precipitation of Î³Êº on both the large and fine Î³Ê¹ precipitates during low-temperature ageing was also observed, owing to the stoichiometrically suitable Al+Ti to Nb ratio and lower lattice misfit. Co-precipitation behavior was found to be independent of the size of the core Î³Ê¹ precipitates. When the same ageing schedule was applied to a specimen solutionized below the Î· solvus temperature (982Â°C), it generated another fine-grained bimodal microstructure with a 65:35% ratio of large to fine Î³Ê¹ precipitates with similar mean particle sizes and Î· precipitates within and at grain boundaries.\r\nThe strengthening behavior of these microstructures was investigated through tensile and plastic strain-controlled low cycle fatigue (LCF) experiments conducted at room temperature and 650Â°C. In order to isolate the damage mechanisms and to establish the distinct dislocationâ€“precipitate interactions responsible for strengthening in bimodal specimens, the standard unimodal specimens also underwent similar experimental schedules. An additional set of specimens from each microstructure was subjected to small plastic deformations (1.8% eng. strain for tensile loading and 25 cycles at 0.15% plastic strain amplitude for LCF experiments) for the study of associated deformation mechanisms through transmission electron microscopy. Critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) for precipitate shearing/ looping for each microstructure was evaluated using TEM observations and calculations based on Kozarâ€™s and Navaâ€™s models for tensile experiments. The individual contributions from precipitate, grain, and solid solution strengthening to the overall yield stress of specimens consisting of different unimodal and bimodal microstructures were evaluated, and the results were rationalized based on the present understanding of the subject reported in the literature.','MME OFFICE','mmoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-10 05:58:39','Active'),(860,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','ADAPTIVE MULTI-OBJECTIVE MODELING FRAMEWORK FOR ENVIRONMENTAL FLOW REGULATION IN A RIVER-RESERVOIR SYSTEM','Ms. Jose Ruby J , Roll No CE13D039','Ph.D Scholar','Dr. Srinivasan K - Guide, Dr. Balaji Narasimhan - Co-Guide, Dr. K.P.

For example, each arm might correspond to performing a product experiment on users. As a result, there has been increasing interest in developing more specialized frameworks where additional structure can be exploited to learn good policies faster.\r\n\r\nIn many applications, the learning agent has the ability to perform interventions on targeted subsets of the population. Further, the agent might also have access to some qualitative causal side information, often drawn from domain knowledge. However, none of the existing contextual bandit frameworks have captured these real world intricacies.\r\n\r\nIn this thesis, we present the first set of formalisms, which we call â€˜causal contextual banditsâ€™, that capture these real world nuances. We provide two different formulations that cater to different sets of applications: a purely interactive setting and a one-shot setting. We provide new contextual bandit algorithms that utilize novel entropy-like measures that we introduce. We show theoretical results on the performance of our algorithms, including regret bounds. We also provide extensive experimental results demonstrating the improved performance of our algorithms compared to baselines. Further, we prove that our algorithms achieve counterfactual fairness; in addition, we also provide a way to achieve demographic parity. Finally, we present the first detailed survey of causality in bandits, and also highlight possible future directions of research.','CS Office','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/aav-xbwz-kbq','','',1,'2024-07-10 07:34:16','Active'),(862,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','â€œVanishing viscosity limit for a class of hyperbolic systems in 1-d with nonlinear viscosity\"','Dr. Animesh Jana  ','.','Post-Doctoral Fellow at CEREMADE\r\nParis Dauphine University,\r\nParis, France\r\n','Department of Mathematics','2024/07/29 11:00','2024-07-29','yes','Seminar Hall (NAC 522), 5th Floor','The vanishing viscosity method is a way to construct and select physically relevant solutions for hyperbolic conservation laws.

It has been used in indigenous medicine for the treatment of diarrhoea, fever, jaundice, diabetes, inflammation and nervous disorders. The wild and in vitro plants are reported to have an array of secondary metabolites, specifically secoiridoids, flavonoids and xanthones which are known to possess anti-atherosclerotic, anti- inflammatory and anti-diabetic activities. Therefore, the synergistic effect of the phytochemicals present in the plant biomass extract can be utilized for the prevention of atherosclerosis and treatment of macroangiopathies. However, as the plant grows in inaccessible regions and seed propagation of the plant is difficult due to low seed germination rates, availability of the plant raw material is limited. Therefore, bioreactor cultivation of the in vitro cell cultures of the S. corymbosa can be an excellent alternative platform independent of the nature for the production of high value Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs). In this regard, we aim to develop a plant cell based bioprocess for the production of anti -atherosclerotic APIs under controlled conditions, which not only ensures large scale biomass production for key phytochemicals extraction but also promotes its continuous use in the indigenous system of medicine in India. Briefly, the bioprocess development will include initiation and identification of faster growing callus line of S.corymbosa, development of  cell suspension culture systems, employment of  various bioprocess optimization strategies to achieve maximum biomass productivity and yield of high value APIs in bioreactors. This PhD research will also include qualitative and quantitative identification and estimation of active metabolites.

Additionally, accurate ego vehicle pose estimation is essential for safer autonomous mobility. Estimating the distance of moving obstacles with a monocular camera is challenging, due to scale ambiguity. Further, current pose estimation methods use sophisticated sensors like high-resolution 3D LiDAR, Camera, and Inertial Measurement Units, thereby increasing the system cost and computational complexity, while still leaving room for accuracy improvements. Hence, we propose a Hybrid Perception System (HPS) by indigenously developing a combined 4-channel Sparse LiDAR along with a camera forming a single unit with necessary data fusion techniques to enhance environmental perception. Accurate sensor fusion requires a precise transformation matrix, but estimating this matrix with low-resolution LiDAR points and camera pixels is difficult, due to the uncertain points generated by low-resolution LiDAR.\r\nIn the first part of this seminar, a new LiDAR-Camera calibration technique will be presented. This technique transforms low-resolution 2D LiDAR points into camera pixels using static and dynamic calibration patterns. It estimates standard homography with Singular Variable Decomposition (SVD), optimizes it with the Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm to minimize rotation error and employs Procrustes analysis (Refined homography) to minimize translation error. The refined homography methodâ€™s accuracy is validated through experiments under varying distances and orientations, showing a reduction in mean reprojection error by 0.45 pixels, rotation error by 65.08%, and distance error by 71.93% compared to standard homography. In the second part, a Monocular Visual Odometry (MVO) algorithm, which estimates vehicle displacement and orientation between consecutive frames without an IMU sensor, will be presented. The MVO consists of four stages: first, converting image pixel coordinates to world coordinates via ground spatial calibration. Second, using cross-correlation-based template matching between successive frames to compute vehicle displacement. Third, estimating the orientation of the matched template along the \'u\' and \'v\' axes of the image. Finally, computing the actual vehicle heading in the global coordinate system to determine vehicle pose. Experimental evaluations show that the MVO algorithm outperforms existing appearance-based methods that use IMU for orientation. When driven for 1406.35 meters, the average distance error observed is 1.41%, demonstrating the MVO algorithmâ€™s enhanced accuracy and efficacy in real-world applications.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/oui-ctab-udb','','',1,'2024-07-10 11:10:27','Active'),(868,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT OF  INDIAN PORTS',' Dr. Venkata Ramana Akkaraju','Dr   Venkata Ramana Akkaraju  has served as Chairman (i/c) and Deputy Chairman of Cochin Port Authority.

Furthermore, the analysis was further extended in terms of\r\n\r\nchip morphology, surface integrity of tool and machined surfaces. Based on the experimental investigations, the chamfered cutting inserts having micro scale textures\r\n\r\nin the form of dimples was observed to be most efficient in enhancing the machining performances than all other tool types. From the cutting force analysis, it was noted that even at higher cutting conditions (cutting speed of 785 m/min and feed rate of 0.18 mm/rev) the cutting inserts having the combination of edge chamfering and micro scale textures in the form of dimples shows a net reduction of 45.43 % in cutting forces. This justifies the effectiveness of the combination of edge chamfering and micro scale textures in controlling the tribological characteristics while machining ductile materials even at high-speed turning modes. The major findings from this research work will be beneficial for the manufacturing industries as sustainable high-speed machining of aluminum alloys are still considered to be highly challenging due to rapid tool failure resulting from the frictional effect at the tool-chip interface and build up edge formation.

The motivation has\r\nbeen on investigating phenomena such as synchronization and ageing transitions, the former\r\nbeing studied primarily through globally coupled Kuramoto oscillators and the latter using a\r\nrandom network of Rulkov neurons. In all these studies, the primary focus has been on investigating\r\nhow the characteristics of the interaction between the different components of the\r\nsystem affect its global dynamical behaviour.\r\nWhile the emergence of synchronization in the basic Kuramoto model is well-studied, the first\r\npart of the thesis explores extended versions of the Kuramoto model. First, a unidirectional\r\ninterlayer coupling scheme in a multilayer configuration of Kuramoto model is examined, where\r\nthe form of the coupling is seen to induce the phenomena of mirroring of synchronization in\r\nthe driven layer. Results for the critical transition points of both the bi-layered and tri-layered\r\nsystems are obtained and verified numerically for different parameter values of the system.\r\nNext, an adaptive coupling scheme is considered, using which the conditions for explosive transitions\r\nare obtained for a general form of the adaptation function. Subsequently, the analysis\r\nis extended to multilayered networks with multiplicative adaptive interlayer interactions. The\r\nresults indicate multiple types of transitions to synchrony that include continuous, explosive,\r\nand tiered transitions, which are demonstrated through numerical simulations of a bi-layered\r\ncross-adaptive system. Finally, in the context of higher-order interactions, a specific linear combination\r\nof the phases for the triadic coupling function is chosen such that the Kuramoto model\r\ndoes not remain invariant under a rotation. This is seen to induce various different dynamical\r\nstates in the system depending on the mean of the natural frequency and the various coupling\r\nstrength of the oscillators, including an unsteady synchronized state demonstrating oscillations\r\nin the order parameter. These are corroborated numerically for different values of the system\r\nparameters.\r\nThe next part of the thesis considers a model consisting of coupled Rulkov neurons, the parameters\r\nof which are modified to induce the phenomena of ageing transitions. In this setting,\r\nthe interplay between network connectivity and coupling strength and its effect on the type of\r\nageing transitions, is investigated using a random network topology. Furthermore, the effect of\r\nfluctuations of the coupling strength are also considered and shown to reduce the occurrence\r\nof explosive ageing transitions.\r\nThe final part of the thesis presents the developments that have been made to increase the\r\ncomputational efficiency of large-scale numerical simulations that have been undertaken in this\r\nthesis. Specifically, the focus has been on parallelization of the numerical algorithms used for\r\nintegrating ordinary differential equations by utilizing single or multiple graphical processing\r\nunits in tandem with single precision floating-point computations. The developments have\r\nbeen benchmarked and have been shown to lead to a significant speedup in execution and are\r\ngeneral enough to be utilized for simulating a large class of other dynamical systems modelled\r\nby ordinary differential equations.','HoD Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/byy-eqfd-gdj','','',1,'2024-07-11 04:47:13','Active'),(876,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Thermal management of electronics under cyclic heat loads using Composite Phase Change Materials','Mr. Sayan Majumder, ME19D411','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide Name: Prof. C.

The effects of thermal cycling can adversely impact the performance and reliability of electronic components. To mitigate these effects and ensure stable operation, designers employ specific materials and techniques.\r\nDuring cyclic thermal loading, there is a periodic variation between heating phases and non-heating phases.

Interestingly, the compound revealed a substantial increase in piezoelectric coefficient (d33) at MPB compositions due to the significant polarization variation induced by the external stimuli e.g. electric field or stress. However, the ambiguities about the superior piezoelectric performance and its correlation to multiphase coexistence persist in the literature. Also, the research on the physical characteristics and application potentials of this system is limited in the literature. In this work, Ba(Ti1-xSnx)O3 (x = 0.0 â€“ 0.30) samples are investigated for their structural, optical, ferroelectric, and dielectric properties to elucidate the correlation between phase evolution with their piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties. The reconstructed phase diagram obtained from the dielectric measurement does not follow the phase constituents attained from the X-ray diffraction measurements. The influence of microstructural domain patterns and the field-induced phase transformations are correlated to explore the insight behind the large d33 in this system. The local structure distortions imposed by the poling field in multiphase coexistence samples are confirmed through extended X-ray absorption fine structure and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements. In the vicinity of the tetragonal-orthorhombic phase boundary, combined dipolar contributions originating from TiO6 and SnO6 octahedra enhanced the piezoelectricity. However, at the orthorhombic-cubic phase boundary, these contributions are counterintuitive and reduces the piezoelectricity. In addition, the electrocaloric properties of a laminated composite structure designed using the x = 0.08, 0.12, and 0.15 compositions revealed enhanced stability of the performance parameters around room temperature. Furthermore, the piezoelectric energy harvesting characteristic performed on x = 0.03 composition displays the generation of a peak-to-peak voltage value of ~ 12 V which indicates the application potential of the Sn-substituted BaTiO3 compound in the energy harvesting field.','HoD Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-11 05:37:59','Active'),(878,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€œINVESTIGATING LIQUID-LIQUID EXTRACTION BASED ON BENIGN SOLVENTS FOR THE EFFECTIVE REMOVAL OF CONTAMINANTS FROM WASTEWATERâ€ ','Mr. Sachind Prabha P (CY18D022)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide- Professor Ramesh Gardas, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/07/12 12:30','2024-07-12','yes','Online-Google Meet','','CY OFFICE','cyoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','ALL ARE WELCOME-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/aft-wiqc-nbn','','',1,'2024-07-11 05:39:58','Active'),(879,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Direct and indirect confinement of upconversion particles and applications','Mr. GOKUL N P, (PH20D039)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide: Dr. BASUDEV ROY','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/07/24 15:00','2024-07-24','yes','HSB-209, Seminar Hall, Department of Physics ','Optical tweezers (OT) is recognized as a versatile tool for confining and manipulating nano and micro objects. However, they possess limitations regarding the properties of probe particles used and the magnitude of force they can exert, typically restricted to sub-Pico Newton levels. Here, we suggest and present some feasible techniques incorporated with an OT setup, aimed at addressing key issues in fundamental micromanipulation methods. In the first part, a multi modal probe particle called iron-doped upconversion particle (Fe-NYF) is introduced. The adequate refractive index, size and intrinsic ferromagnetic properties of these particles allow us to optically trap and magnetically manipulate them in all degrees of freedom, particularly in the rotational sense. Then, in the second part, a fluid flow and temperature field-assisted, indirect optical trapping is realised with the help of two laser beams focused on a gold surface and spatially separated apart. We call this trapping scheme a \'hydro-thermophoretic trap\'. Subsequently in next part of the talk, we show the controlled out-of-plane roll rotation of a single hexagonal-shaped particle. The measurement of the angular momentum in such a scenario enables us to calculate the force applied by the fluid flow experimentally. And as an application of optical heating of UCP in OTs, a microscopic Stirling engine using an optically trapped upconversion particle that acts simultaneously as a heat source and as a working substance will be demonstrated. This technique essentially eliminates the requirement of external heat baths for a microscopic engine to perform. Finally, a new microscopic thermometric mechanism based on tracking the phase change in the wavefront of emission from an upconversion particle is introduced in the last session. Unlike conventional methods that rely on emission line ratios, in this work, we utilize a wavefront detector to track distortion in the emission wavefronts from upconversion particles.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

This research focuses on experimentally investigating the mechanical properties of mild steel after exposure to different temperatures and cooling rates. The mechanical properties examined include the modulus of elasticity, yield and ultimate strengths, and ductility. Concurrently, the study numerically analyzes the residual stresses in different I-section geometries after cooling from elevated temperatures with varying fire exposure conditions and cooling methods. The residual stresses, typically induced by the fabrication processes, are the locked-in stresses prior to structural loading. The magnitude and distribution of these residual stresses play a primary role in determining the design strength of steel I-beams and columns, especially in the inelastic range. However, in the event of a fire, the residual stresses are expected to change based on the number of sides exposed to the fire and the cooling technique used to suppress a fire. Although the nature of residual stresses in steel I-sections at ambient temperature is known, the noticeable changes in the residual stresses after a fire are poorly understood. Subsequently, its impact on the residual strength of steel members is not adequately documented. Therefore, the residual stresses in different I-section geometry are numerically deduced after cooling from exposure to different elevated temperatures, different sides of exposure, and different cooling rates. With the help of the residual mechanical properties and residual stresses post-fires, predicting the residual strengths of I-members subjected to different fire-exposure scenarios becomes possible.','R.

The numericalmodeling of the VBI system involves idealizations of vehicles, bridges, tires,and road roughness. Various numerical models have been developed in theliterature. The vehicle can be modeled as a moving force model, moving massmodel, quarter car model, half car model, and full car model. The bridge can bemodeled as a beam model, plate model, grillage model, shell and beam model, and3D solid element model. The tire and bridge contact can be modeled as asingle-point contact model, multi-point contact model, or patch contact model,or solve the non-linear contact problem assuming the tire and bridge are rigidor deformable bodies. Now, with the availability of various models, it iscrucial to know their applicability and accuracy. Hence, the current studyaddresses the significant questions of concern: What are the differences betweenthe various VBI models? How does the model predict the field test measurementvalues for a given condition? Hence, finally, to arrive at the answer to thequestion, when should we use which model?

Deep-Tech Start-ups differentiate themselves from other Technology-based start-ups by focusing on unique, proprietary, and hard-to-reproduce technological or scientific advances instead of limiting themselves to Business Model Innovations or Digital Transformation of existing functions. In developing countries like India, Governments and Policymakers progressively establish and support Incubation units as the primary driver to propel Entrepreneurship and Innovation. Among all partnership opportunities, Deep-Technology based ventures are primarily associated with Academic Incubators. Academic Business Incubators are support ecosystems that enable Technopreneurs to launch start-ups based on novel technologies and new business models. Investors and Technology Scouts are increasingly collaborating with Academic Incubators to identify and acquire emerging Technology. This surge in the adoption of business incubation in the context of Deep-Tech venture creation necessitates studies on assessing existing Incubation units in terms of their ability to support Deep-Technology based venture creation. Drawing from extant literature, we adopt the Benchmarking approach and In-Situ approaches to assess Incubation Performance. To this extent, we adopt a multi-methods approach to study Indian Academic Business Incubation programmes with a specific focus on Incubation Performance and potential improvement strategies. Firstly, we undertake the benchmarking approach using secondary data, 32 Centrally Funded Technical Institutes (CFTIs) in India were ranked based on their relative Incubation performance. For this purpose, a composite Incubation Performance score was computed using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The score comprises seven indices - Mentoring Support Index, Funding Support Index, Infrastructure Index, Networking Support Index, University Image Index, Venture Creation Index, and Sustainability Index. Secondly, we undertake Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to assess the efficiency with which the 32 CFTIs attain their computed Incubation Performance, given their established Academic Outcomes across four dimensions â€“ i) Teaching, Learning & Resources, ii) Research and Professional Practice, iii) Graduation Outcomes, and iv) Outreach and Inclusivity. We use Context-Dependent DEA to classify the institutes based on Evaluation Contexts into layers and compute Attractiveness and Progress scores to determine Benchmarking Pathways across the layers that inefficient units can follow to improve their performance step-by-step. Thirdly, taking an in-situ approach to understand the role of Academic Incubation in Deep-Tech venture creation from the perspective of Incubatee entrepreneurs, we employ a Systems Theory-based participatory research methodology, viz., Interactive Qualitative Analysis (IQA) by collecting primary data from participant Deep-Tech Incubatee Entrepreneurs. Finally, based on the emergent affinities and additional relevant attributes identified through further analysis of the literature, we undertake an Impact-Range Performance Analysis (IRPA) to prioritise the improvement of academic incubation attributes with reference to deep-tech venture creation based on inputs collected from incubatees in Indian Academic Incubators.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','SEMINAR - II (RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM)-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-11 11:21:15','Active'),(885,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Wideband capacitive and dielectric-less high breakdown voltage RF MEMS switch','Mr. Anurag Swarnkar (EE16D208)','Ph.D scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering',' Dr. Deleep R Nair','Electrical Engineering','2024/07/15 11:00','2024-07-15','yes','Online (Googlemeet)','This work presents design, fabrication and characterization of RF MEMS SPST and SPDT switches for wideband applications. Initially, a novel RF MEMS Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) shunt capacitive switch is presented which consists of two identical beams placed in parallel over floating metals of different lengths on the signal line of a CPW. With two beams in parallel, the effective resistance and inductance of the switch is lesser than a switch with only one beam. The decrease in resistance provides higher isolation at resonant frequency while the decrease in inductance provides higher isolation at frequencies beyond resonant frequency. While the increase in insertion loss due to two beams is insignificant, there is a substantial increase in isolation over a large band of frequency. A switch with two beams with isolation greater than 30 dB and insertion loss less than 0.5 dB in the range of 3 GHz to 30 GHz is demonstrated. Secondly, SPST and SPDT ohmic switches are designed to counter the dielectric charging issues present in the capacitive switches. Dielectric charging is a serious issue which can lead to pull-in voltage shift and eventually may lead to permanent failure of the device. Any attempt to remove the dielectric completely from the process may improve the reliability of RF MEMS switches significantly. To mitigate the impact of dielectric charging, high breakdown voltage dielectric-less cantilever beams with bump on beam (BOB) and bump on contact metal (BOC) are designed, fabricated and characterized. The optimized cantilever beam is then used to fabricate series SPST, shunt SPST and SPDT switches, respectively. The SPDT switch offers high isolation of greater than -30 dB in the range of DC to 18 GHz. Whereas insertion loss of less than -1.4 dB was achieved in the same range.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/xmo-ugaz-ana','','',1,'2024-07-12 03:59:57','Active'),(886,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Optical generation of modulated X-Band RF and beyond for satellite applications using optical phase locked loop and phase noise analysis for ARoF links','Ms. Bhooma G (EE17D403)','Ph.D scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Deepa Venkitesh\r\nCo-Guide: Dr. Yogesh Prasad K.R (URSC) ','Electrical Engineering','2024/07/13 17:00','2024-07-13','yes','Online (Googlemeet)','Frequency bands in the mmWave are gaining more attention in both ground and space communication links. Low earth orbit and geostationary orbit satellites are progressively becoming popular for offering higher bandwidth for various applications. Consequently, most global satellite manufacturers and operators are utilizing the higher bandwidth capabilities of Ku (12 - 18 GHz), K (18 - 27 GHz) and Ka (26.5 - 40 GHz) frequency bands for data communication in LEO satellites. In our work, we focus on optical generation of RF signals using photonic techniques that offer benefits of frequency agility, ease of scaling to higher frequencies and reduction in hardware complexity. We discuss the generation of QPSK modulated data in the X-Band and Ku-band by optical heterodyning of two optically phase locked lasers with a prescaler in loop, and one of the lasers modulated with the data. We present the generation and detection of QPSK modulated data. Demodulation of the received data is carried out through appropriate post processing using DSP algorithms. The approach is scalable to  mm-wave frequencies and beyond. The work is extended for data transport through fiber for symbol rates upto 4 GBaud. Apart from the applications involving satellites, the next generation wireless systems are also expected to operate in W-Band (75 GHz-110 GHz) and D-Band (110 GHz-170 GHz). Generation and transport of these high frequencies are preferably done through all-optical methods via the Analog Radio over fiber (RoF) link due to the advantages of smaller loss and higher bandwidth capabilities. In many such applications, the process involves transporting the signal through long lengths of fiber. We had earlier presented the effect of  phase noise from transmitter, optical fiber channel and receiver on the overall phase noise of the remotely generated RF and compared it with the RF source phase noise through numerical model and experimental results. In this talk, we extend this analysis to a fiber link with an amplifier, since the analog RF links could typically work with optical amplifiers. We find that the phase noise at lower frequency offsets from the RF (less than 1 kHz) are dominated by laser flicker noise. Frequency offsets between 1 kHz to 600 kHz are dominated by the fiber related double rayleigh scattering noise that has interdependence on the laser linewidth and chromatic dispersion (CD) post, which is affected by the noise floors created by the amplitude noise sources in the link. Scaling to higher frequencies (D-Band) increases CD with the RF source and CD mainly governing the phase noise of the transported RF.\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/mrn-cvio-tjv','','',1,'2024-07-12 04:02:22','Active'),(887,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','In pursuit of a universal model for molecular diffusion in glass-formers','Harish Srinivasan','Harish Srinivasan graduated with an M.Sc. in 2014 from the Department of Theoretical Physics at the University of Madras.

This research addresses two key areas: the constitutive modelling of soft elastomers and their use in structural dynamics. Constitutive modelling of soft elastomers employs two main approaches: phenomenological and micromechanics-based. A major challenge in this field is creating an effective strain energy function that encompasses a wide range of elastomer behaviors while minimizing reliance on multiaxial experimental data. Additionally, dynamic actuation requires incorporating an effective electrical potential. This study aims to develop a hyperelastic, viscoelastic, and electrical potential function.

Its primary function is to manage thermal energy, facilitating heating, cooling, condensation, and evaporation in sectors such as power generation, chemical processing, and HVAC systems. By optimizing heat transfer, heat exchangers enhance energy efficiency, reduce operational costs, and improve system performance.\r\n\r\nContinuous innovations in design aim to tackle challenges like fouling, corrosion, and pressure drops, thereby extending the lifespan and reliability of these devices. Traditional heat exchangers with plain tubes often fall short in performance due to low thermal efficiency. To address this, heat transfer enhancement technologies have been developed. Various passive techniques, such as fins, ribs, twisted tapes, wire coils, insert devices, nanofluids, and dimples/protrusions, have been investigated for their ability to enhance heat transfer rates.\r\n\r\nAmong these, surfaces with protrusions or dimples have shown promise in improving heat transfer performance with relatively low-pressure loss penalties. However, studies on turbulent flows within elliptical tubes are limited. The unique wall curvature of elliptical tubes induces secondary flows, which redistribute high-momentum fluid from the pipe centre towards the major and minor axis ends, enhancing circulation.\r\n\r\nThis research numerically analyzes the flow characteristics and heat transfer performance of an enhanced elliptical tube with teardrop protrusions. The study focuses on a conventional elliptical plain tube with protrusions at the ends of the major and minor axes. The objective is to study the flow field structure and heat transfer mechanisms of the enhanced elliptical tube. Additionally, the effects of protrusion depth, pitch, and orientation on thermal-hydraulic performance are examined.\r\n\r\nThe k-Ï‰ SST turbulence model was employed in the numerical simulations, with Reynolds numbers ranging from 20,000 to 45,000. The influence of different geometric parameters on the Nusselt number and friction factor was studied. The investigation revealed that teardrop dimples improve flow mixing, disrupt the boundary layer, and create periodic impingement flows, significantly enhancing heat transfer. The Nusselt number of the enhanced elliptical tube increases with protrusion depth and decreases with pitch. Under the different operating conditions and geometric parameters considered, the enhanced elliptical tube achieved a Performance Evaluation Criterion (PEC) value of approximately 1.14, indicating substantial improvement in thermal performance.

Research shows that high-intensity therapy is required for optimal recovery\r\nfrom stroke. However, poor access, reducing healthcare budgets, lack of trained\r\ntherapists, etc., have hindered providing high-intensity therapy.\r\n\r\nRehabilitation robots were introduced to overcome these barriers by providing high-\r\nintensity semi-supervised therapy. Though end-effector robots are simple and easy to\r\n\r\nuse, features such as single joint training needed for severely impaired stroke subjects\r\nand tracking human joint kinematics are lacking. The Arm Rehabilitation Robot\r\n\r\n(AREBO)â€”an end-effector robotâ€”was thus designed to provide both single and multi-\r\njoint assisted training while tracking human joint kinematics. The first part of the thesis\r\n\r\npresents the design, optimization, and characterization of AREBO for training single-\r\njoint movements of the arm. AREBO has three actuated and three unactuated degrees\r\n\r\nof freedom, allowing it to apply forces in any arbitrary direction at its endpoint and self-\r\nalign to arbitrary orientations within its workspace.\r\n\r\nThe characterization of the robotâ€™s controller and the algorithm for estimating the\r\nhuman arm parameters were performed using a two degrees of freedom mechatronic\r\nmodel of the human shoulder joint. The results demonstrate that (a) the movements of\r\nthe human arm can be estimated, (b) AREBO has similar transparency to that of existing\r\narm therapy robots, and (c) the adaptive weight support mode control can adapt to\r\ndifferent levels of impairments. \r\nIn recent years, home therapy has been seen as a vital avenue to achieve high-intensity\r\ntherapy. Providing arm weight support is one of the prominent techniques for arm\r\ntherapy as it increases the arm\'s range of motion and breaks abnormal movement\r\npatterns. Simple and compact passive arm weight support devices used at home do not\r\nprovide feedback, which leads to poor adherence, and the desired high-intensity therapy\r\nis not achieved. Arm rehabilitation robots can be used for training with adaptive arm\r\nweight support, but they tend to be complex and bulky for use in small clinics or homes.\r\nTo this end, a simple, single actuated degree of freedom robot â€“ MARS (Motorized Arm\r\nSupport) that can provide adaptive arm deweighting and measure arm movements to\r\nprovide gamified feedback for in-clinic and at-home use is proposed. The second half\r\nof the thesis presents the mechanical design of MARS, the algorithms for estimating\r\nhuman joint kinematics from the robotâ€™s data, and the characterization of its two control\r\nmodes: 1) Fixed Support and 2) Arm Weight Support.\r\nAREBO, with its unactuated degrees of freedom removed, forms the mechatronic\r\nhuman arm that was utilized in the characterization of MARS. The results of the\r\ncharacterization indicate that 1) the arm angles can be estimated with high accuracy\r\nwithout any external sensors, 2) the transparency of MARS is comparable with existing\r\narm rehabilitation robots, 3) MARS can maintain a constant interaction force in\r\ndynamic conditions, and 4) the adaptive weight support from MARS adjust\r\nautomatically to compensate for the weakness in the arm. With the completion of the\r\nits design and characterization, MARSâ€™ usability will be evaluated by clinicians and\r\nstroke survivors with arm impairments through the proposed usability study.\r\nTo conclude, a significant contribution has been made to arm rehabilitation robots with\r\nAREBO redefining the scope of end-effector robots, and MARS simplifying arm\r\nrehabilitation robots to the maximum extent possible.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','KEYWORDS: rehabilitation robots, end-effector, adaptive weight support, home- based rehabilitation, ','','',1,'2024-07-12 11:33:29','Active'),(895,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Ph.D Seminar Talk - II -  Ballistic evaluation of concrete panels','Mr. Roouf Un Nabi Dar , Roll No. CE21D016','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. P Alagappan - Guide, Dr. S Arul Jayachandran - DC Member, Dr. U Saravanan - DC Member, Dr. G Rajesh, (AE) - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE','Civil Engineering','2024/07/15 15:00','2024-07-15','yes','Google Meet','Ballistic design is crucial for widely utilized concrete structures in today\'s unpredictable world. In the past, extensive experimental and numerical studies have investigated concrete panels, resulting in design guidelines and empirical formulations for local damage parameters. However, with the advent of performance-based design, notably in seismic design, the ballistic design of concrete structures lacks a comprehensive design philosophy. Additionally, deterministic empirical formulations for local damage parameters such as depth of penetration (DOP), crater diameter and residual velocity necessitate a probabilistic treatment. Consequently, this research addresses the need for a well-defined ballistic design philosophy for concrete structures and introduces a probabilistic approach for local damage parameters. Firstly, a novel multi-level and multi-parameter performance-based design framework for reinforced concrete (RC) panels is proposed, centered on damage states, namely depth of penetration and crater area. This framework establishes an innovative design philosophy featuring four damage levels for each state. Secondly, using dimensionless explanatory functions, a Bayesian inference model is developed to estimate the DOP, crater diameter and residual velocity in RC panels under hard projectile impact, accounting for the associated uncertainties. LS-Dyna is used for numerical modelling of RC panels and rigid projectiles. The numerical models are validated with the experimental data and are utilized to develop the probabilistic model. This study reveals the profound influence of projectile and concrete properties on crater formation in addition to the incidence angle of the projectile. The developed probabilistic models are validated with experimental results from the literature demonstrating their reliability and accuracy. An experimental study is also carried out to study the angular projectile impact on PC and RC panels serving as additional validation to the probabilistic models developed. Consequently, a reliable design formulae for estimating local damage parameters for RC panels under hard projectile impact is proposed in addition to the novel ballistic design framework.','Manikandan R, CE Office','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/tto-wmni-tjz','','',1,'2024-07-12 12:17:38','Active'),(896,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€œA Meshless Shock- Capturing Method for Solving the Shallow Water Equationsâ€','Mr. Deyyala Satyaprasad, Roll No. MA17D200','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','DC Members: Dr. C h.

Due to this inherent nonequilibrium property, researches on these systems have gained wide attention among the scientific community. Advancements in the field upheld futuristic applications like advanced diagnostics, drug delivery, swarm robotics etc.\r\n\r\nIn the current work, we study the behaviour of a binary passive system when interacting with few active particles, all being confined in a fixed boundary. The active particles have a directed motion which arises due to their self-propulsion. At regular intervals, the active particles change their propulsion orientation for which we seek the application of Reinforcement Learning RL. RL trains the agent a Neural Network to take decisions that in turn controls the orientation of active particles. We develop a model to incorporate the defined active-passive system the environment with RL to realise the active particles interacting with the passive particles maximising an objective and thereby the cumulative reward. A reward is defined to quantify the passivepassive mixing and the neural network MultiLayer Perceptron being updated using PPO algorithm. We have also observed the success of this model by proper selection of system parameters and algorithm Hyperparameters.\r\n\r\nThe success of this model ensures the ability to effectively train an agent to control the active particles to realise an objective. This can be further extended to realise desired phenomenon by redefining the environment and reward function.

In recent years, in conjunction with theoretical research, we have witnessed\r\nsome fascinating applications being developed using microfluidic technology, mainly\r\nin the field of bio-analysis. Some of them have led to successful product development.\r\n\r\nMicrofluidic technology has allowed us to develop a complete lab on a few centimetre-\r\nsized chip. In the first part of the work, a novel technique for detection and isolation\r\n\r\nof circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from cancer patientâ€™s blood has been explored. The\r\ninvestigation of a property unique to cancer cells, which has the ability to detect the\r\nmajority of types of cancer cells, has been undertaken. The limitations of conventional\r\ntagging techniques involving the targeting of naturally occurring surface proteins can\r\nbe overcome by our technique. In this technique, artificial molecules are introduced on\r\nthe surface of cancer cells/CTCs through the process of metabolic glycoengineering.\r\nThese surface molecules are present in greater numbers than naturally occurring surface\r\nproteins, enhancing detection capabilities. A similar protocol has been used for different\r\nstudies like metabolism and drug delivery, but the method is unexplored for detection and\r\nisolation in the microchannel. Hence, further work is performed on protocol development\r\nfor tagging, which can compete with current tagging protocols in opto-microfluidics\r\ndetection technology. Additionally, CTCs encapsulated in droplets are detected in the\r\nmicrochannel with an integrated optical detection system. A comparative study of our\r\ndetection method and conventional method is conducted. In this study, the detection of\r\nthree different cancer cell linesâ€”cervical cancer cell line Hela (EpCAM negative), breast\r\ncancer cell lines MCF7 (strongly EpCAM positive), and MDA-MB-231 (Weakly EpCAM\r\n\r\npositive, triple-negative breast cancer cell line) is demonstrated on the opto-micro- fluidics-based platform. Performance parameters such as tagging efficiency, capture\r\nefficiency, coefficient of variation of optical signals, and the capability of detected cells\r\nfor downstream analysis are reported in this work. The capability of the device to detect\r\nCTCs in cancer patientâ€™s blood has also been tested. This approach is further extended\r\nfor isolating cancer cells from other healthy blood cells (PBMCs), in which fluorescent\r\nmolecules are replaced with magnetic beads so that when the cell sample flows through\r\nthe microchannel, magnetic force can help sort the cells and collect them from the\r\ndifferent outlet. Metabolic glycoengineering has been successfully applied to tag cancer\r\ncells with magnetic beads, and this technique has been demonstrated to enable isolation\r\nin microchannel design. Through the analysis of Multiphysics simulations, both the\r\ndesign and process parameters have been optimized, leading to the development of a new,\r\nmore efficient design of the microfluidic platform. In subsequent phases of our work, the\r\ndesign and experimentation of an oil extraction channel aimed at achieving more efficient\r\ndroplet incubation for on-chip single-cell processing is undertaken. The oil extraction\r\nregion comprises an array of thin microchannels connected to the main channel, with\r\ncarefully controlled suction applied to remove excess oil while preserving the integrity\r\nof droplets. The study encompasses the investigation of droplet dynamics, such as\r\ntrends in droplet volume fraction, droplet velocity, and inter-droplet distance reduction as\r\ndroplets traverse through the oil-extraction region. A quantitative model for inter-droplet\r\ndistance reduction has been developed through the creation of a hydrodynamic resistive\r\nmodel of the channel design, simulated via Spice-based software to estimate flow rates.\r\nFurthermore, the successful incubation of a large quantity of high-throughput droplets for\r\na significantly extended time ( 1 hour) is showcased in this research. This work represents\r\na comprehensive approach to optimizing microchannel performance, with potential\r\napplications in various fields, including microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip technologies.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','KEYWORDS: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), metabolic glycoengineering, CTC detection, CTC isolation, ','','',1,'2024-07-13 10:14:48','Active'),(901,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Lab-On-Chip for Circulating Tumor Cells','Ms. Kshitija Shivaji Mirkale, Roll No. ME19D705','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide - Prof. P.

It offers high power density with better controllability and power quality, which is not possible with conventional Low Frequency Transformer (LFT) based solution. The present work focuses on SST technology based architecture for both grid integration and motor drive applications. They are mainly wind and solar farms, data centers, microgrids, EV charging stations, and propulsion drives. It also addresses the associated challenges, including control complexity, power quality issues, and higher semiconductor losses in MV stage of CHB based SST for aforementioned applications.\r\n\r\nThree stage SST based MVAC collection system and its associated control architecture with integrated dynamic modelling for offshore wind firms are proposed in present work. The proposed solution offers significant advantages over existing MVAC collection systems, including reduced weight and size of the nacelle system, leading to lower maintenance costs and complexity. This SST technology is also used for  integration of the multiple grids with different voltage levels for the applications in microgrids, distribution networks, data centers, and EV charging stations However, MV grid connected SST introduces power quality issues (poor current THD) due to the dead time effect and harmonics present in grid voltage. A novel hybrid control technique is proposed to ensure perfectly sinusoidal MV grid current even under light load conditions, resulting in improved grid current THD. Experimental validation using a 20kW CHB based SST prototype demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach. The proposed hybrid control technique is further extended to address the trade-off between cost and performance of the SST that explores a cost effective alternative utilizing both Si-IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs in the MV stage. The extended  hybrid control approach simultaneously improves semiconductor losses (nearly 50 %) as well as power quality. SST technology holds immense potential for next generation MV motor drive applications, particularly in marine propulsion systems, because the lighter and compact electric drive is the preferred choice in this application. This work also proposes a modified CHB-based SST fed high frequency propulsion drive with a new modulation technique. The proposed drive offers high power density and achieves a higher effective switching frequency with reduced semiconductor losses. It is validated in a 7-level modified CHB based SST fed drive prototype. To further enhance the reliability of variable speed drives, this research also addresses their sensitivity to power supply disturbances. A simple and cost effective regenerative ride through technique is proposed for CHB inverter fed induction motor drives, ensuring smooth operation during power interruptions or voltage sag. This improves overall system resilience.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/nno-izkv-ehd','','',1,'2024-07-15 03:16:06','Active'),(904,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- கட்டுமானங்கள் (kattumaanangal)\r\nHindi word	- भवन-निर्माण (bhavan-nirmaan)\r\nEnglish word	- Constructions','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-15 04:27:22','default_value'),(905,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Studies on uncertainty in the estimation of embodied energy in residential building construction','Ms. Ganga Warrier A , Roll No: CE16D032','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. Sivakumar Palaniappan- Guide, Dr. Ashwin Mahalingam - DC Member, Dr. Gitakrishnan Ramadurai - DC Member, Dr. R K Amit (MS) - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Head & DC Chairperson','Civil Department','2024/07/22 11:00','2024-07-22','yes','BSB 104 Conference Room','','Manikandan.

These steel-concrete composite (SCC) beams are also used for the continuous span. When these beams are subjected to negative or hogging bending, cracks are developed in concrete due to tension, and the majority of the bending is resisted by steel. The analysis and design of the same is still a complex phenomenon that mandates experimental work to evaluate the design capacity. Failure typically occurs at the internal support, specifically in the hogging bending region, due to the yielding of reinforcing bars in concrete. To prevent premature failure, additional reinforcement steel is added, leading to congested internal supports. To address this, the concept called Simple in Dead Load and Continuous in Live Load (SDCL) connection is proposed, initially used in precast concrete bridges but now extended to steel-concrete composite construction. SDCL connections offer an economical and efficient alternative to internal supports, reducing construction costs and time. The study aims in the development of procedures to design these diaphragms under hogging bending.','R.

Through the development of robust conceptual frameworks, the research addresses three critical facets: affective and behavioral responses to brand transgressions, the role of shame during brand transgressions, and the stage-wise development of branded individuals in consumer-brand relationships.\r\nStudy 1: This study delves into the differentiation between types of brand transgressions. The multidisciplinary theoretical integration in the study adopts exchange and penetration principles of social psychology and trust in interpersonal relationships to explain the development and decline of consumer-brand relationships. The findings of the study elucidate the nature of trust consumers develop with brands and highlight the distinct consequences of brand transgressions. Brand transgressions are categorized into two types â€“ dissatisfaction and violation of trust. The study posits that dissatisfaction arises from performance-related failures, while trust violation results from values-related failures by the brand. It also presents the unique affective and behavioral consumer responses to these different transgression scenarios. \r\nStudy 2: Transgressions by brands that fail to meet consumer moral/ethical expectations are perceived by consumers as failures in their own self-evaluation and otherâ€™s judgment of their personal standards. Study 2 highlights the importance of exploring negative self-conscious emotions that result from self-evaluation in consumer-brand relationships. Building on the understanding from Study 1, this study specifically investigates the affective and behavioral consumer responses to negative self-conscious emotion of shame arising from a brandâ€™s moral/ethical violation of trust. Addressing the limited attention given to exploring negative self-conscious emotions in consumer-brand relationships, this study examines the antecedents and consequences of shame. Further, the study identifies self-evaluation and anticipation of social responses as mediators and brand attachment as moderating consumer experience of shame. \r\nStudy 3: Insights from Study 2 highlight the profound impact of moral/ethical violations of trust, emphasizing the importance of extending this understanding to the heightened emotional bonds formed in consumer relationships with branded individuals. This study presents a stage-wise developmental model of branded individuals, identifying three stages â€“ human brands, celebrity, and person-brands. Human brands establish trust through consistent performance and professional reliability, while celebrities deepen consumer connections by sharing personal insights, and person-brands merge personal and professional identities. The study explores the distinction between trust dynamics and equity at each of these stages. \r\nOverall, this research enhances the theoretical and practical understanding of consumer-brand relationships, particularly in the face of brand transgressions. The findings offer significant implications for theory and practice aiming to navigate and mitigate the complexities of maintaining consumer trust in today\'s competitive marketplace.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-15 07:56:02','Active'),(909,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Caste and Entrepreneurship in the Neoliberal Economy: A Sociological Study of a Caste-based Chamber of Commerce ','Mr. Kiran Kumar D N (HS19D002)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras.','Dr. Santhosh R (Guide), Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras.','Department of Humanities and Social Sciences','2024/07/18 12:00','2024-07-18','yes','Google meet','Though the opening of the economy in 1991 has made some scholars write obituaries on caste functioning as a business community, some scholars have argued that the re-configuration and articulations of caste identities in the neoliberal economy allow the privileged castes to form close-knit business communities. In this direction, the present seminar looks at the mutual pollination of caste and economy by tracing the relationship between entrepreneurship and changing caste articulations of the traditional trading community of Gowda Saraswat Brahmins in the colonial and post-colonial periods. The seminar, in particular, focuses on the socio-cultural strategies deployed by the caste elites in the service of entrepreneurial prospects and argues that the Saraswat Chamber of Commerce, formed in 2019, acts as a caste organization to build a close-knit business community. By uniting entrepreneurs from various sub-castes of GSBs across regions, the paper argues, the Chamber of Commerce facilitates the â€˜in-born entrepreneursâ€™ to revive entrepreneurship and caste dominance, building a cohesive and corporate caste identity of Saraswat, claiming themselves as patriotic and forebearers of national culture in the contemporary ethnic democracy.

In the representative fiction and films of the 1940s and the early 1950s, reformist values coexist with cultural orthodoxies and Dravidian regionalism is offset by a nationalist agenda. The main aim of this research project is to examine the different and sometimes contradictory manifestations of modernity in the popular literature and media of this era.  So, modern innovations in the form and theme of literature will be read in relation to the traditionalist impulse to recapture a glorious past â€“which in this context is in keeping with the Dravidian political project of foregrounding a Tamil pride that often sought to be established through a historical narrative. The â€˜fictions of memoryâ€™ (Brigit Neumann), â€˜compensatory and contestatoryâ€™ forms of classicism (Sumathi Ramasamy), and nostalgic tales (Svetlana Boym) that this process inspired, will be examined, primarily through the works of four writersâ€”Kalki, Pudumaipittan, Anna and Karunanidhi. The writers under study were engaged in the ideologies and economies of modernity in Tamil Nadu, represented by the novel, the short story, the magazine and the film. While they are emphatically â€˜modernâ€™ in their self-fashioning, they strategically used antiquity to highlight presentist concerns and produced what may be considered to be â€œiconicâ€ texts that continue to be referenced in Tamil popular culture today\r\n. The notion of renaissance/revivalism (marumalarcci), has been associated with the works of all four writers but have different connotations in the larger context of their works. The objective of this analysis of popular literary and cinematic texts that intersect with the political transformations in the context of mid-twentieth century Tamil Nadu, is to delineate the primary aspects of Tamil modernity as revealed through these texts. It is also relevant to examine the distinctive figure of the Tamil writer that emerges through the Forties and the Fiftiesâ€”the writer as the multifaceted poet, novelist, dramatist, screenwriter, editor, columnist, ideologue and political activist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/cuh-ckkp-dpw','','',1,'2024-07-15 10:16:24','Active'),(912,'','Promotion',NULL,'Elective Course Announcement: Physical Ceramics (MM5460)',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'I am pleased to announce that I am offering the elective course, Physical Ceramics (MM5460), in the Department of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering starting at the end of this month (29th, July).\r\nThe course content is structured as follows: The first half of the course will cover fundamental topics essential for understanding the principles of ceramics.\r\nBonding in Ceramics: We will begin with the basic principles of bonding in ceramics.\r\nStructure of Ceramics: Ceramics are solid materials consisting of a continuous bonding arrangement, ranging from short-range (amorphous) to long-range (crystalline) order. This section will cover the arrangement of atoms and ions in crystalline ceramics.\r\nThermodynamics and Kinetics of Ceramics: We will study the basic thermodynamic and kinetic principles required to explain and understand physical phenomena in ceramics.\r\nDefects in Ceramics / Diffusion and Electrical Conductivity: Real ceramic materials are not perfect crystals; they contain many defects. These defects, along with their types and behavior (diffusion), significantly influence the properties of materials. Additionally, diffusion phenomena greatly affect the sintering and functionality of ceramics. This section will cover the description of defects and the ionic/electronic conductivity of ceramics.\r\nEvaluation up to mid-term: The first half of the semester will primarily focus on these basic topics, and midterm assessments will be based on quizzes from these sections.\r\nIn the second half of the semester, I will introduce topics such as the sintering, mechanical properties, and other functional properties of ceramics.\r\nSintering and Grain Growth: This section will explain the atomic-scale phenomenology of ceramic sintering, which relates to diffusion phenomena discussed in the previous section.\r\nMechanical Properties in Ceramics: Ceramics are typically brittle because they lack mechanisms to relax stress at the tips of cracks and defects. This section will cover the conditions for fracture, and methods to improve toughness, hardness, and wear resistance. Additionally, we will discuss the basic principles of creep phenomena.\r\nFunctional Properties in Ceramics: We will cover the dielectric, magnetic, and optical properties of ceramics as functional materials.\r\nChemical Processing for Ceramic Materials: As a relatively new synthesis method for ceramics, I will introduce the chemical processes for synthesizing ceramics, which is my area of expertise.\r\nEvaluation of the second half semester: The second half of the course will address various functional aspects of ceramics. Therefore, I encourage students to update their knowledge based on their interests. The evaluation for the latter half of the term will be based on summaries and reviews of recent related papers.\r\nThis elective course has a maximum capacity of 15 students from our department (MME) and up to 30 students including those from other departments.

Hence, reducing CO2 emission has become the focus of research in this sector. Though Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) helps in reducing CO2 emissions, they come with critical caveats such as low range, need of renewable energy source, safe disposal of battery and charging infrastructures. Thus hybrid powertrains bridge the gap between the conventional and BEVs thereby reducing CO2 emissions. Though hybrid powertrains are common in passenger car and commercial vehicles, less focus has been given in developing hybrid two-wheelers which is essential in Asian countries. \r\nThis work focusses on developing an efficient hybrid powertrain for small two-wheeler applications. Initially, the existing engine and CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) were experimentally evaluated to determine its performance characteristics. A physics based model was used to simulate the CVT. A Neural Network (NN) based model was tuned and developed to predict the transient emissions of the engine. Map based models were developed to predict the efficiencies of the engine and the CVT. A vehicle model was developed with the individual component models and was validated with vehicle test results. This validated vehicle model was used to assess different powertrain topologies. The results show that the CVT losses are significant and hence hybrid powertrain topologies without CVT were simulated on WMTC (World Motorcycle Test Cycle) drive cycle and found that the fuel economy can be increased by about 70%, HC and CO emissions were reduced by 11 and 50% respectively. But NOx emissions increased significantly compared to the conventional powertrain but were within the regulatory limits.\r\nThe Energy Management Strategy developed in this study is explained in detail. Parametric study of important design and operating parameters were done. The study showed that the fuel economy was optimal when the Electric Machine (EM) power is 2.4 kW and reducing ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) operating torque reduces the cumulative NOx emissions significantly. A novel two-speed transmission system that has speed and torque sensitive automated shifting mechanism was developed. This transmission aids in the grade-ability performance and fuel economy of the proposed hybrid powertrain.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/fow-fhdf-hsa','','',1,'2024-07-16 09:19:11','Active'),(916,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Tunable acoustic metamaterial for underwater application.','Mr. Vineeth P R, ME16D202','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide Name: Prof. Prabhu Rajagopal, ME /\r\nDC Members Names: 1)	Prof. Anuradha Banerjee, Applied Mechanics\r\n2)	Prof. Parag Ravindran, Machine Design\r\n','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/07/22 15:00','2024-07-22','yes','Through Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/xjk-eyvb-xfz','Metamaterials have been widely studied in recent years, setting out their various exotic properties. We have proposed a passive noise control system enabled by an acoustic superscatterer, a type of metamaterial, to suppress the far-field sound radiated from a vibrating cylindrical rod. Superscatterers are known to expand the rigid boundary of an object, thereby enhancing the scattering cross-section of the object. But a passive configuration of such a superscatterer has limitations in frequency and loading performance. In this seminar, we present a novel tunable acoustic superscatterer whose scattering cross-section in water can be varied with externally applied stimuli. The core of the superscatterer is filled with a smart fluid (magnetorheological fluid) and the envelope is made of an extremely anisotropic acoustic metasurface in the form of a maze-like annular sleeve which can be additively manufactured. When an external magnetic field is applied in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the incoming acoustic field, the scattering boundary of the core is modulated, resulting in switchable total scattering cross-section of the superscatterer. Here we report analytical studies demonstrating this concept, as well as numerical simulation results that support the analytical results, thus drawing conclusions vital for practical applications such as switchable noise control, acoustic stealth or enhanced detection etc.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/xjk-eyvb-xfz','','',1,'2024-07-16 14:16:57','Active'),(917,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','2D LiDAR-Camera Calibration and Appearance-Based Monocular Visual Odometry for Improved Autonomous Driving Systems','Mr. R.

Additionally, accurate ego vehicle pose estimation is essential for safer autonomous mobility. Estimating the distance of moving obstacles with a monocular camera is challenging, due to scale ambiguity. Further, current pose estimation methods use sophisticated sensors like high-resolution 3D LiDAR, Camera, and Inertial Measurement Units, thereby increasing the system cost and computational complexity, while still leaving room for accuracy improvements. Hence, we propose a Hybrid Perception System (HPS) by indigenously developing a combined 4-channel Sparse LiDAR along with a camera forming a single unit with necessary data fusion techniques to enhance environmental perception. Accurate sensor fusion requires a precise transformation matrix, but estimating this matrix with low-resolution LiDAR points and camera pixels is difficult, due to the uncertain points generated by low-resolution LiDAR.\r\nIn the first part of this seminar, a new LiDAR-Camera calibration technique will be presented. This technique transforms low-resolution 2D LiDAR points into camera pixels using static and dynamic calibration patterns. It estimates standard homography with Singular Variable Decomposition (SVD), optimizes it with the Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm to minimize rotation error and employs Procrustes analysis (Refined homography) to minimize translation error. The refined homography methodâ€™s accuracy is validated through experiments under varying distances and orientations, showing a reduction in mean reprojection error by 0.45 pixels, rotation error by 65.08%, and distance error by 71.93% compared to standard homography. In the second part, a Monocular Visual Odometry (MVO) algorithm, which estimates vehicle displacement and orientation between consecutive frames without an IMU sensor, will be presented. The MVO consists of four stages: first, converting image pixel coordinates to world coordinates via ground spatial calibration. Second, using cross-correlation-based template matching between successive frames to compute vehicle displacement. Third, estimating the orientation of the matched template along the \'u\' and \'v\' axes of the image.

It finds its application in many areas, including nuclear reactor cooling, thermal desalination, chemical industries and power electronics. The present work is a numerical study of NPB process in which FVM based ANSYS Fluent 2021 R1 has been employed with its built-in feature of interface tracking based on VOF method. For water as the working fluid, the effect of microlayer evaporation underneath the bubble base has been included with the help of user-defined function (UDF). The phase change behaviour at the interface of vapor bubble has been modeled by using â€˜Saturated-Interface-Volumeâ€™ phase change model. Surface wettability plays a significant role in determining the heat transfer characteristics associated with a growing bubble in NPB. Most of the prior works have considered the growth of the bubble under terrestrial gravity conditions. The process of NPB can also be employed as a promising method for heat transfer in devices and equipment working under low gravity conditions. The advancement in computational techniques offers improvement to numerically investigate the impact of surface wettability on NPB heat transfer at various gravity levels so as to design the enhanced surface in a rational manner. The present work initially discusses about the growth process  of the bubble on a horizontal surface with varying wettability at different gravity levels. Subsequently, the effect of surface curvature has been explored on the characteristics of bubble growth and departure, such as departure diameter, departure time, base radius and morphology of the bubble. In addition, spatial and temporal variations of heat flux have been evaluated for the curved surface and compared with that for plane surface. Furthermore, the effect of wettability and superheat on the curved surface have also been studied in contrast to the plane surface.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/vhp-xfkg-jgu','','',1,'2024-07-18 05:26:20','Active'),(919,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- ஆய்வகம் (aayvagam)\r\nHindi word	- प्रयोगशाला (prayogshaalaa)\r\nEnglish word	- Laboratory','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-18 06:13:17','default_value'),(920,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','FIBER OPTIC BIOSENSORS FOR POINT-OF-CARE DIAGNOSTICS: PROBE DESIGN, SURFACE MODIFICATION AND CLINICAL EVALUATION','Mr. Ratan Kumar Chaudhary (AM19D013)','Ph.

Early diagnosis of infectious diseases as well as non-communicable diseases becomes crucial for initiating timely treatment, effective monitoring and better management of diseases. Typically, early diagnosis involves precisely detecting the specific molecular biomarker associated with a particular disease. Conventional molecular techniques including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) require sophisticated infrastructure, laborious and time-consuming processes, and skilled personnel. As a potential alternative, fiber optic sensors (FOS), particularly U-bent FOS (U-FOS) platforms offer various advantages including remarkable refractive index (RI) sensitivity and exceptional evanescent wave absorbance (EWA) sensitivity, simpler LED-photodetector based optoelectronic instrumentation, cost-effectiveness, ease-in-fabrication, and ergonomic sensor probe design compatible with conventional PCR setup. In this context, the current thesis focuses on U-bent FOS probe designs for higher sensitivity and the associated development of the plasmonic fiberoptic absorbance biosensor (P-FAB) for accurate molecular biomarker detection. Here, P-FAB-based sandwich immunoassay with gold nanoparticle (AuNP) labels has been demonstrated for clinical diagnosis, wherein the light passing through the U-bent FOS is absorbed by the AuNP labels as a result of the sandwich immunocomplex formation on the fiber surface.\r\nPrior to realizing the P-FAB for placental growth factor (PlGF) and p16 for the detection of preeclampsia and cervical cancer, respectively, investigations were carried out to explore step-etched U-FOS and cladded probes as a means to achieve more sensitive EWA sensors and simpler fiber optic RI sensors, respectively. In addition to the fiber probe material (glass and polymeric optical fibers, GOF and POF, respectively) and the fiber probe geometry (core, bend diameter, cladding, decladding and step etching), an optimum fiber probe cleaning strategy, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) surface modification for the 0.5 mm POF, AuNP-antibodies (Ab) conjugation and AuNP-Ab label concentration were investigated in detail.\r\nThe RI sensitivity studies on U-FOS probes made using cladded GOF and POF were carried out, where the probes showed a slightly improved sensitivity till the RI of the analytical solution was 0.02 units less than that of the cladding layer, followed by saturation in the sensor absorption response, unlike the decladded probes that show an RI sensitivity up to the RI value of the fiber core. This was irrespective of the fiber core material, POF or GOF. On the other hand, the EWA studies on step-etched U-bent GOF probes (600 Âµm core etched to ~ 200 Âµm) with fluorophore-tagged immunoglobulin-G (IgG) loading efficiency show ~2-fold higher EWA sensitivity at lower concentrations of IgG (1 Âµg/mL) due to a plausible improvement in EW depth of penetration. Further studies pose technical challenges due to the fragility of GOF probes, expensive, high volume of reagents, and harsh chemicals. Given the nature of PMMA material used in POF, their surface functional groups are relatively poor than that of GOF. This limitation requires an efficient PMMA surface modification strategy for biosensing applications. Hence, a novel poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer based PMMA surface modification is established to obtain a greater immobilization of the bioreceptors compared to a linear molecule like hexamethylenediamine (HMDA), in order to overcome PMMAâ€™s chemical inertness. Subsequently, P-FAB strategy was realized by immobilizing the mouse anti-PlGF (3H1) on the U-bent POF sensor probe surface and AuNP labels conjugated with mouse anti-PlGF (6H9). The POF sensor probes could measure PlGF within 30 min with a 20Ã— AuNP-Ab label concentration. The limit-of-detection (LoD) was found to be 0.19 pg/mL and 0.57 pg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 10Ã— diluted serum, respectively. The clinical sample testing, with eleven positive and eleven negative preeclamptic pregnancy samples, successfully confirmed the accuracy, reliability, specificity, and sensitivity of the P-FAB-based POF sensor platform. Similarly, P-FAB strategy for p16 detection for cervical cancer diagnosis using GOF sensor probes has been demonstrated, given the clinical demand for a point-of-care (PoC) tool to be used in early detection. The LoD was found to be 0.168 ng/mL in PBS buffer. Moreover, biomarker detection in HeLa cell lysates was also achieved, where p16 from as low as 500 cells could be detected using the P-FAB platform. P-FAB was able to distinguish between positive and negative cervical cancer plasma samples. Further scope borders upon robust clinical evaluation, large-scale validation and scale-up of the established technology towards use in molecular labs and at PoC settings. In summary, this thesis successfully demonstrates P-FAB for preeclampsia and cervical cancer diagnosis, thereby establishing its clinical potential for many other disease diagnoses, especially in remote areas and resource-limited settings.\r\n','HoD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','KEYWORDS: U-bent fiber optic sensors, Evanescent wave absorbance, PAMAM dendrimer, Placental growth ','','',1,'2024-07-18 07:38:24','Active'),(921,'','Others','Department Degree Distribution Programme ( D3P)','Convocation',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2024/07/19 17:00',NULL,NULL,'CLT','','Department  of Ocean Engineering','oeoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in;','','event18-07-2024 08:02','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/event18-07-2024 08:02',1,'2024-07-18 08:03:01','Active'),(922,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','\"Constrained Bayesian Optimization: A big-M approachâ€ ','Mr. Raju Chowdhury MA18D200','Research Scholars, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','DC Members: Dr. Santanu Sarkar / Dr. A.

Currently, about 60-70% of available drugs are reported to have low aqueous solubility, and this number is expected to increase as the pharmaceutical industry shifts its attention to more complex APIs. The standard practice includes extensive use of excipients to improve the solubility. However, these excipients come with a list of disadvantages. Therefore, there remains an unmet need to improve the solubility of APIs without depending solely on excipients. To tackle these solubility issues, we have recently proposed reformulated API (rAPI) technology in which APIs are complexed with novel ionic liquid molecules that improve the solubility of representative APIs significantly. ILs are a class of green solvents that gained attention due to their tunable physicochemical properties and high solubilizing capacity. In this study, we propose to work with two very important drug molecules, Propofol and Aprepitant. Propofol is a well-known general anesthetic used extensively during medical procedures and surgeries. On the other hand, Aprepitant is approved for treating acute and delayed nausea and vomiting in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The dosages of both the drugs are very high due to insolubility in water, and the side effects associated with the added excipients. Our goal is to improve the solubility of these drug molecules by optimally conjugating them with specific IL molecules. The synthesized rAPIs after thorough characterization will be tested for their solubility and efficacy through in vitro and in vivo studies.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-18 09:46:17','Active'),(924,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Development and optimization of an energy efficient novel microwave route for cladding of Co-based alloys on Ni-based Superalloys.','Mr. Aveek Mohanty, ME16D019','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide Name: Professor Sushanta Kumar Panigrahi, ME /\r\nDC Members Names: Dr. Srinivasa Rao Bakshi, MME Dept.,\r\n                                                      Dr. Anil Kumar Meena, ME Dept.,\r\n                                                     Dr. Sivasrinivasu Devadula, ME Dept.\r\n','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/07/25 15:00','2024-07-25','yes','MES Seminar Hall, Ranganathan Building, IIT Madras','Ni-based superalloys are ideal for strategic sectors (nuclear, defence, marine, petrochemical, boiler industries, gas turbines, aircraft engines etc) due to its high mechanical and chemical property at aggressive environment (high temperature wear, oxidation, and corrosion). To prevent components from early-stage failure and extend its longevity in aggressive environment, protective coatings/claddings on the surface of superalloys are frequently used. While traditional coating techniques are effective in many applications, they present several inherent challenges, prompting the exploration of alternatives like microwave cladding. Conventional coating methods are often energy-intensive, resulting in higher operational costs and environmental concerns. Microwave cladding offers high efficiency and can substantially reduce energy consumption compared to traditional methods. Microwave cladding enables rapid heating and deposition, thereby increasing production rates. This technique ensures precise material distribution, minimizing waste and making it a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly option. \r\nThe present work focuses on an energy-efficient microwave-based manufacturing route for cladding of Co-alloys on Inconel-718 by optimizing microwave assisting parameters. The cladding mechanism and processing strategy of the developed microwave cladding has been discussed in detail. At present most industry utilizes HVOF (High-Velocity Oxy-Fuel) thermal spray technology to deposit various Co-based coatings on metallic substrate. However, the HVOF-sprayed coatings often exhibit high amount of porosity, presence of oxide phase, and un-melted particles. Furthermore, the HVOF-deposited coatings have relatively poor adhesion (mechanically bonded) to their substrates, which limits the suitability of the method. Therefore, present study also investigates the feasibility of microwave post-processing route to overcome the above disadvantages of HVOF coatings. The performance of the microwave post-processed HVOF coatings were evaluated in terms of microstructure, microhardness, abrasion wear and corrosion behaviour. The intrinsic mechanism of microwave post-treatment and improved properties were also suggested. Overall, the study establishes an energy efficient microwave routes for cladding and post-processing of coatings to improve the mechanical, tribological and corrosion resistance performance for various industrial applications.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-19 00:35:49','Active'),(925,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- பட்டமளிப்பு விழா  (pattamalippu vizhaa)\r\nHindi word	- दीक्षांत समारोह  (deekshaanth samaaroh)\r\nEnglish word	- Convocation\r\n','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-19 04:41:27','default_value'),(926,'','Others',NULL,'Department Degree Distribution Function (D3P) - Department of Physics',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'We are delighted to invite you to the Department Degree Distribution Programme (D3P), hosted by the Department of Physics.','Physics Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-19 04:51:29','default_value'),(927,'seminar','Technical Talk','NULL','\"The High-Temperature Strength of Single Crystal Ni-Bases Superalloys: Constant Strain-rate, Creep and Out-of-Phase Thermomechanical Fatigue Testing\"','Dr.-Ing.

Over the past decade, halide perovskites have demonstrated exceptional photovoltaic performance owing to their tunable optoelectronic properties. Two-dimensional (2D) layered halide perovskites, which crystallize in non-centrosymmetric space groups, demonstrate intrinsic bulk ferroelectric polarization, making them highly promising for such applications. Halide ferroelectric materials have attracted considerable attention due to their distinctive electrical and structural characteristics. This study reports on the design and characterization of two new non-centrosymmetric 2D layered halide double perovskite materials: Cl1.14Br2.86PA4AgInBr8 (CPAIn) and Cl0.26Br3.74PA4AgSbBr8 (CPAS). CPAIn exhibits ferroelectric behavior above room temperature, with a Curie temperature of 190 Â°C, achieved through halogenated A-site organic linker substitution. It displays anisotropic ferroelectric properties, with a high spontaneous polarization of 6.25 Î¼C.cmâˆ’2 perpendicular to octahedral layers and 0.174 Î¼C.cmâˆ’2 between sheets. CPAS also shows above-room-temperature ferroelectricity, with a spontaneous polarization of 3.4 Î¼C.cm-2, oriented perpendicular to its octahedral sheets. Both materials display directional-dependent ferroelectric properties and demonstrate enhanced conductivity as temperature rises. CPAIn and CPAS, therefore, emerge as promising candidates for use in memory devices, sensors, photovoltaics, piezoelectric devices, and energy storage applications.\r\nKeywords: Ferroelectric, Halide perovskites, Two-dimensional, Polarization, Non-centrosymmetric, Anisotropic','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/jrf-msmk-qwwâ€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬','seminar22-07-2024 04:54','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar22-07-2024 04:54',1,'2024-07-22 04:54:12','Active'),(932,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Brain-Inspired Computing Using Magnetic Domain Wall Devices','S.

To realize spin-based neuromorphic computing practically, it is essential to design and fabricate electronic analogues of neurons and synapses. An electronic analogue of a synaptic device should provide multiple resistance states. A neuron device should receive multiple inputs and should provide a pulse output when the summation of the multiple inputs exceeds a threshold.\r\n\r\nOur group has been carrying out investigations on the design and development of various synaptic and neuron devices in our laboratory. Domain wall (DW) devices based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), where the DW can be moved by spin-orbit torque, are suitable candidates for the fabrication of synaptic and neuron devices [2]. Spin-orbit torque helps in achieving DW motion at low energies whereas the use of MTJs helps in translating DW position information into resistance levels (or voltage pulses) [3]. This talk will summarize various designs of synthetic neurons synaptic elements and materials [4]. The first half of the talk will be at an introductory level, aimed at first-year graduate students.

The ability to obtain ultra-light weight nano-porous and disordered structure is key in realizing the desired low thermal conductivity, which is useful in thermal insulator applications. In this work, we have explored 3D graphene-based networks as a tunable thermal insulator and electrical conductor. The 3D networks were synthesized by solution-based gelation followed by critical point drying to obtaining 3D freestanding aerogels with densities varying from 5 to 10 mg/cm3 with low thermal conductivity (~ 15-35 mW/m.K and high electrical conductivity (0.4- 1.4 S/m). Tunability in thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity were studied as a function of crosslinker concentration as well as temperature. \r\n\r\nWe have studied the correlation of electrical and thermal transport in graphene aerogels with density using power- scaling law and extracted the scaling exponents for both, which are found to be lower than those for conventional aerogels. At low crosslinker concentration, a breakdown of the scaling behaviour with density is observed. [1]\r\n\r\nWe have also investigated thermal transport in three-dimensional graphene aerogel networks at elevated temperatures. Thermal conductivity of the system is estimated using steady-state electrothermal technique in vacuum in the temperature interval from 30 to 200 Â°C. The thermal conductivity value is Îºâˆ¼0.2 W/m.K at room temperature, and is found to be weakly dependent on temperature across the entire temperature interval. The partial reduction achieves a delicate balance between imparting chemical stability while also retaining the dominance of point-defect phonon scattering over Umklapp scattering, where the latter contributes to temperature stable thermal conductivity.

During disease progression, changes in structure, function, or composition, happen at both these levels. Our aim is to discern these changes using non-invasive methods leveraging light-tissue interactions. There are multiple phenomena such as absorption, scattering and reflection, during the interaction of light with a biological sample. Laser Speckle Imaging (LSI) is a modality based on the scattering phenomenon of light and provides a cumulative effect of change in the optical scattering of the media. LSI has been extensively used to capture the changes in the microcirculatory flow and finds application in the fields of ophthalmology, neuroscience, and dermatology. Here, we would like to explore the potential application of LSI in sensing structural changes in tissues using static scattering and extend it to less explored biological samples such as biofilms and further explore dynamics like bacterial kinetics. \r\n\r\nPreliminary studies have been performed on skin-mimicking phantoms by extracting various features from the raw speckle images that aid in the quantification of the tissue structure (increased thickness) and function (microcirculation) during disease progression. Laser speckle parameters for extracting structural differences such as spatial disorganization and orientation changes of cellular structures have been explored here to discern tissue structure changes at a cellular level. The study is extended to other biological samples such as biofilms, resembling thin tissue sections. The structural changes during different stages of growth are correlated with various speckle parameters and validated using optical microscopy images. Further, different phases of bacterial growth in a liquid medium are correlated with changes in the speckle contrast.\r\n \r\nHence, a comprehensive study of laser speckle patterns acquired across various biological media, ranging from tissue-mimicking phantoms to thin tissue sections, further extended to bacterial biofilms has been presented with applications in medical diagnosis and biotechnology.\r\n','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline meeting link: https://meet.google.com/aww-odph-myq ','','',1,'2024-07-22 09:52:32','Active'),(937,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','Special Lecture on Radar Systems','Cdr Ajay Kumar','Cdr Ajay Kumar is from Naval Institute of Aeronautical Technology, a distinguished expert in the field.','Dr. David Kumar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering.','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/07/23 15:00','2024-07-23','','Seminar Hall, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-22 11:19:22','Active'),(938,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Identification of synthetic lethal interactions of MEN1 in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.','Mariya Reji (BT22D037)','PhD Scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Advisor: Dr. Nathiya Muthalagu (BT)','Department of Biotechnology','2024/07/29 15:30','2024-07-29','','BT Seminar Hall','Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) represent a rare and heterogeneous subset of pancreatic neoplasms, characterized by a high mortality rate of 60%. Mutations in the MEN1 gene, which encodes the scaffold protein menin, are prevalent in PanNETs, with over 35% of patients exhibiting loss of function mutations. Despite the critical role of MEN1 in these tumors, no targeted therapies have been developed due to the loss of menin function. Synthetic lethality offers a promising therapeutic strategy for targeting such tumors where protein expression is compromised. A synthetic lethal interaction occurs when simultaneous mutations in two genes result in cell death, while a mutation in only one of these genes is non-lethal. Therapeutic strategies that exploit synthetic lethal interactions would selectively target cancer cells harboring specific mutations, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing off-target effects. This study aims to identify synthetic lethal interactors of menin, which could delineate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for PanNETs. We will generate MEN1 knockout cell lines that stably express CAS9 and utilize CRISPR-based kinome screening to identify kinases essential for the survival of MEN1 knockout cells but non-lethal in MEN1 wild-type cells. This approach will elucidate critical pathway dependencies in PanNETs and facilitate the development of targeted therapies for tumors with MEN1 mutations.\r\n\r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-22 11:46:02','Active'),(939,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- மிக நன்று, மிக நல்ல (miga nandru, miga nalla)\r\nHindi word	- बहुत अच्छा (bahut achchaa)\r\nEnglish word	- very good','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-23 04:32:57','default_value'),(940,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','Hydrodynamics of dense pulsating matter','Dr. Tirthankar Banerjee','Dr. Tirthankar Banerjee is a researcher at the University of Luxembourg.

We will show that the proposed hydrodynamic theory captures the three main states emerging in its particle-based counterparts: a globally cycling state, a homogeneous arrested state with constant phase, and a state with propagating radial waves. We will show that the competition between these states can be rationalized intuitively in terms of an effective landscape and argue that waves can be regarded as secondary instabilities. Through linear stability analysis of arrested and cycling states, we will predict phase boundaries and then discuss how these are affected by fluctuations.

This work proposes an optimal risk-constrained energy management approach for a microgrid (MG) that can trade electricity in the day-ahead (DA) market to maximize the expected profit. The proposed approach is based on prospect stochastic dominance (PSD), which involves both risk aversion and risk-seeking behaviour. The different sources of uncertainty, such as renewable distributed energy resources, DA electricity price, and load demand, are considered using a scenario-based approach.

However, India lacks most of the crucial metals needed for LIB battery manufacturing including Li, Ni, Co. At the same time, India, the third largest producer of e-waste in the world (including portable batteries), is collecting/recycling less than 10% of the waste in formal sector, with the rest handled by unskilled workers in hazardous conditions or ending up in landfills contaminating soil and water. Recovering valuable metals from the LIB battery waste will not only reduce the valuable metals ending up in landfill, but will also reduce the burden of importing battery metals/minerals needed for fresh LIB materials manufacturing in India. Hydrometallurgy has emerged as a versatile technology in the recovery of metals from various waste streams including batteries, solar cells and other electronic wastes. In this work we discuss hydrometallurgy-based recovery of transition metals salts of Ni, Co and Mn from waste LIBs. Furthermore, for future work, we also discuss some strategies in electrometallurgical and  pyrometallurgical methods to recover pure Ni and Co metals along with Li salts.

Wide-spread commercialisation of agriculture during British colonial rule in India led to large-scale plantations (of commercial crops like rubber and tea), even in territories like the princely state of Travancore in the southwestern part of India -  ruled by a hereditary monarchy, but indirectly controlled by the British paramountcy. The expansion of plantations (pushed by British colonial agents), led to a reduction in high-altitude cultivation of food crops that forced the princely state to enhance the supply of rice through massive reclamation of lands from the backwaters, majorly in the Kuttanadu region (parts of Alappuzha, Kottayam, and Pathanamthitta districts of the present day State of Kerala). Backwater Reclamation was an indigenous technology that the princely administration adopted from the original inhabitants of the area who were turned into agrestic slaves through stringent socio-political-cultural norms. A crucial aspect of this process was the building and maintenance of a dyke that separated the rice land from the backwater. The labourerâ€™s family in homesteads supervised the dykes and ensured the stability of their built environment - which was constantly endangered by strong currents of water and harsh monsoon rains.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, imported technologies like motor pumps were also improvised. Thus, there was a hybrid choice and deployment of tools in the socio-technical system which integrated a colonial â€˜backwaterâ€™ (pun intended) into the global market that engendered ever more commercialisation of agriculture.  This study will critically examine backwater reclamation and associated â€˜repairsâ€™ as a human and technological mechanism in the face of the combined wrath and onslaught of nature and colonialism. The study also aims to provide pointers for present-day â€˜repairâ€™ and safe-guarding of the agrarian system from existential threats such as encroachment, flooding, and water pollution.\r\n\r\nApart from analysing the role of â€˜physicalâ€™ repair this study also discusses â€˜politicalâ€™ repair - of relations between a princely state and colonialism (addressing the quest to produce more crops and the paramount powerâ€™s concerns around the backwater reclamation), and the â€˜emotional/ psychologicalâ€™ repair necessitated by the brute labour requirements extracted from communities deprived of humane treatment. This also addresses the intricacies of caste ties and finances made ready for investments in reclamation and farming endeavours. Using â€˜repairâ€™ as a framework, this study provides a fresh understanding of the socio-political-cultural and economic processes in Kuttanad.\r\n\r\n\r\n','HSS OFFICE','hsoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/gxn-ncvf-njq','','',1,'2024-07-23 06:26:47','Active'),(944,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\" 3-D Interface Assisted Stabilization of Ultrathin Silver Film on Oxide Substrates \"','Mr. Allamula Ashok (MM20D016)','Ph.D Scholar, Dept of MME.','Guide:  Satyesh Kumar Yadav , MME','Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering','2024/08/05 16:00','2024-08-05','','NAC 222, Seminar hall, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engg','Ultrathin Silver (Ag) films (< 20 nm) have potential applications in optical devices, solar devices, sensors, catalysis, electronics and plasmonic devices. However, continuous ultrathin Ag film growth on an oxide substrate cannot be achieved. This has been attributed to the low affinity of Ag towards oxide substrates (Volmerâ€“Weber growth), which also results in poor adhesion. Some approaches have been used to stabilize ultrathin Ag films on oxide substrates. Reportedly, they are seed layer and co-deposition techniques by using modifier materials like Niobium (Nb), Germanium (Ge), Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), Copper (Cu), Titanium (Ti) and Aluminium (Al). The reason for using the seed layer is due to their higher oxygen affinity than Ag. If the relative oxygen affinity of the seed layer is the only reason, then Zn should also work as a modifier material. We report zinc (Zn) as a new seed layer material and a need for a specific deposition sequence to grow ultrathin continuous and stable silver (Ag) films on quartz (SiO2). We carried out a design of experiments (DOE) study to optimize the deposition process parameters of DC magnetron sputtering system using a Taguchi design methodology and response surface methods assisted by ANOVA. We find that the deposition rate increases with increasing sputtering power. The highest deposition rate for a maximum power considered (25 W) is achieved at an intermediate working pressure of 6.1Ã—10-3 mbar. The lowest deposition rate was obtained for minimum power (5 W) and the highest working pressure (8.5Ã—10-3 mbar). Ag films of thickness 4, 6, 8 and 10 nm were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering without and with Zn seed layer thickness of 1, 2 and 4 nm. The effect of Zn seed layer thickness and its annealing on the surface morphology, sheet resistance, and stability of ultrathin Ag films is investigated. We show that by increasing Zn seed layer thickness from 1 to 2 nm, there is a 5-order reduction in sheet resistance of 6 nm Ag films. We find that annealing of seed layer is crucial to achieve stability of ultrathin Ag films. 6 nm Ag film with 2 nm Zn is unstable to 100 OC annealing, while the 6 nm Ag film with annealed 2 nm Zn seed layer is stable. 2 nm Zn seeded 8 nm Ag film maintained a constant sheet resistance of 7 Î©/â–¡ for all 6 months of exposure to ambient conditions. Among the ultrathin film grown, 8nm Ag film with 2nm Zn seed layer had the best figure of merit with sheet resistance of 7 Î©/â–¡, mean absolute surface roughness (Ra) ~1 nm, and optical transparency of  61 %. Based on the comparative sheet resistance of the ultrathin Ag films, we propose an atomic structure of the substrate, Zn and Ag heterostructure. Zinc partially or fully fills the nano roughness associated with the substrates and forms an atomically chemically graded interface with Ag. Thus, leading to smoothly varying chemistry across the substrate and Ag, which we refer to as a 3-D interface. The ability of Zn to fill the substrate roughness partially or fully could result in improved adhesion of Zn along with the Ag to the substrate. The conductivity of stabilized ultrathin Ag films in the THz wavelength spectrum is also studied.\r\nKeywords: Taguchi design, Magnetron Sputtering, Response Surface Methodology (RSM), Design of experiments, ANOVA, Sheet resistance, Surface roughness, ultrathin Ag films, thermal stability, seed layer, zinc.','MME Office','mmoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-23 06:30:37','Active'),(945,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Range Avoidance via Turan-type Bounds on Hypergraphs','Neha Kuntwar','PhD Scholar, Dept of CSE, IIT Madras','Narayanaswamy N S (Chair i/c), Jayalal Sarma (Guide), Nishad Kothari (CS), Raghavendra Rao (CS), Aprameyan P (MA)\r\n','CSE','2024/07/26 11:00','2024-07-26','','A M Turing Hall (SSB 334)','The range avoidance problem (denoted by AVOID) is as follows: given a Boolean circuit C  computing a function from {0,1}^n to {0,1}^m with m > n, find a a string which is outside the range of the circuit.

Such transmitted diseases, from animals to humans are known as zoonotic diseases. Most of the emerging and re-emerging diseases are zoonoses, and many of these diseases are classified as neglected zoonotic diseases (NZDs). Right from the Spanish Flu in 1920s till the recent SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, zoonotic diseases have been a major cause for pandemics affecting millions of lives, livestock and subsequently the economy. Yet, surveillance, diagnoses and interventions, are typically carried out independent of each other, pertaining to both public and animal health. Moreover, it is challenging to evaluate the morbidity and death rates of NZDs as many are underreported and/or underestimated, and also challenging to precisely diagnose.\r\nA consistent and focussed â€˜One-Healthâ€™ approach is the key towards preventing and treating many of the diseases, thereby saving lives of both people and animals. In this context, surveillance and timely diagnosis becomes important, especially in resource-limited settings encompassing Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, where proper medical facilities or treatment are not easily available or accessible. On one hand, conventional detection methods such as PCR and ELISA lack the required clinical sensitivity or specificity, while on the other hand, culture-based methods requiring high-end infrastructure may not be available everywhere for ready access. The resulting inaccurate results from such diagnostic protocols could have detrimental effects on the individual or the community.

Atomistic flaws like Schottky defects (missing atoms) or Stone-Wales defects (rotated bonds) in ordered crystalline materials like Graphene affect the far field Cauchy stress evolution and the local energy release rate. Multi-scale predictions of the mechanical strength and energy release using molecular dynamics (MD) are observed to deviate from the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) below a certain length scale. The deviations will be highlighted in the presentation for Graphene Nano platelets subjected to isotropic, uniaxial straining at room temperature. Similarly, polycrystals are composed of grains appearing in different sizes, shapes, and orientations. The assumption of macroscopic homogeneity is associated with considering an effective elastic stiffness for the bulk\r\nmedium. On the other hand, the macroscopic isotropy corresponds to a random grain orientation distribution in the respective microstructure. However, this spatial variation in the grain orientations results in microscopic heterogeneities that scatter the propagating elastic waves, resulting in attenuation in energy and a change in wavespeed (phase velocity). The existing analytical models consider first-order correlations between grain\r\nboundaries. These models can provide reasonably accurate estimates of attenuation and wavespeed for elastic wave propagation in metals with a low degree of heterogeneity, for example, aluminium. However, these estimates break down with an increase in the crystallite anisotropy. This presentation will highlight the frequency-dependent effects on the attenuation and wavespeed estimates for elastic wave propagation in common metals through the development of an analytical model, including the higher-order statistical correlations between grain boundaries. Lastly, the microscopic heterogeneities also influence the macroscopic crack speed divergence (Paris law) in metals subjected to fatigue fracture. Moreover, the existing strategies can make use of the acoustic activity rates to detect residual lifetime through inverse square root relations. The presentation will include the elasto plastic finite element cohesive zone models (FE-CZM) toward validation through the acoustic emission experiments and the analytical crack speed divergence at criticality.','Prof. R.

This catalytic space can be used for computation, under the condition that the initial contents of this full space get restored at the end. The class CL is the set of languages computed by catalytic Turing machines equipped with O(log n) workspace and polynomial size catalytic space. Buhrman et al (2014) demonstrated the power of the model by proposing efficient algorithms for the reachability problem in this model. However, designing algorithms for the catalytic computation model is still a challenging task. With this view, we relax the original restoration requirement and study cases where we do not need to restore the content of the catalytic tape for all possible contents. If the content of the catalytic tape is w \\in A (called the catalytic set), then the catalytic Turing machine needs to restore it at the end of the computation, and it is not a requirement when w is not in the catalytic set. We call such machines almost-catalytic Turing machines. \r\n\r\nWe observe that to design catalytic algorithms for a problem, it suffices to design almost-catalytic algorithms  for the problem where the catalytic set is the set of strings of odd weight (PARITY). Towards this, we consider two complexity measures of the set A which are maximized for PARITY. One is the random projection complexity (denoted by R(A)) and the other is the subcube partition complexity (denoted by P(A)). We show that, for all k \\ge 1, there exists a language A_k \\subseteq \\Sigma^*  such that any Turing machine that uses space O(n^k) can be simulated by almost catalytic Turing machines that has random projection complexity of m/4 and exponentially large partition complexity. This is in contrast to the catalytic machine model where it is unclear if it can simulate Turing machines that uses even omega(log n) space. We further show improved simulations on these complexity parameters if we are simulating Turing machines that run in O(log^k n) space instead of O(n^k) space. Our main technical idea is that of using special logspace decodable codes to design almost catalytic algorithms. Finally, we explore limitations of a direct simulation via this approach, by demonstrating connections to parameters of linear codes. Enroute our study, we also demonstrate the power of an extra alphabet in the catalytic set by demonstrating that with an extra alphabet, the CL machines can simulate any polynomial space Turing machine as well.','Jayalal Sarma','jayalal@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-23 10:29:02','Active'),(950,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Dynamical and Performance Study of Oscillating Foils','Mr.Sourav Dey (AE19D015)','Ph.D Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','Dr.Sunetra Sarkar - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/07/24 15:30','2024-07-24','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/aas-qfzu-hsb   ','','',1,'2024-07-23 10:46:11','Active'),(951,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Effect of Chemical Treatment and thermal conditioning of  flax fiber and flax/epoxy composites subjected to  mechanical loading.','Mr.Shivank Kumar (AE21S044)','M.S Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering.','Dr.Prashant Rawat - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/07/29 15:00','2024-07-29','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/xpw-jetg-wxs','','',1,'2024-07-23 10:48:49','Active'),(952,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Assessing the Variability of Aerosol Optical Depth over India under Futuristic Climate Scenarios: An Implication of Carbonaceous Aerosols','Mr. Anchan Nidhi Loknath, Roll Number : CE21S015 ','M.S.

However, they produce higher nitrogen oxide (NOx) and soot emissions, particularly under high-load conditions. To mitigate this, several strategies are employed, viz., exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), optimization of fuel injection timing, and use of fuel additives, However, all these methods have their own limitations. Direct water injection inside the combustion chamber of the engine is found to be an effective method in improving performance as well as the emissions characteristics of the GDI engine. From the literature, it is found that the effectiveness of the water injection strategy depends on the in-cylinder distribution of water inside the combustion chamber. In this study, extensive numerical analysis has been made to figure out the effect of water distribution inside the combustion chamber of naturally aspirated four-stroke spray-guided GDI engines and is compared with the no water injection (NWI) case. In addition, a dimensionless parameter, the â€œwater distribution indexâ€ (WDI), was defined based on the optimum water distribution profile to quantitatively compare the in-cylinder water distribution. For the analysis, the engine is made to run at a compression ratio (CR) of 10, an engine speed of 1000 rev/min., and an overall equivalence ratio of 1.02. The result shows that out of the various water distribution profiles, the Gaussian distribution is found to be the optimum. Furthermore, a water injector orientation (WIO) of 20Â° and injector location of 15 mm was found to be the optimum, with the WDI of 0.43. Moreover, IMEP is found to be improved by about 3%. NOx and soot emissions are reduced by 23.67 % and 22.2 % compared to the baseline case.

Invariably, the channel estimation or system identification problem is much easier to solve than an equalizer estimation problem, which is an inverse filtering problem. Hence, our main interest is to investigate how the estimated channel coefficients can help find equalizers faster (i.e., with a small training period) and cheaper (i.e., low computational cost). Typically, single carrier receivers sample at higher than Nyquist rates (mâ„T), where m>1 is the over-sampling factor, and it is well-known that a fractionally spaced equalizer performs much better than a symbol-spaced equalizer. Ideally, when the overall impulse response meets the Nyquist criterion, intersymbol interference (ISI) can be eliminated fully from the received samples. In practice, sufficient ISI mitigation can be achieved if the unknown equalizer problem is modelled as a least squares measurement model, with the desired overall response being any Nyquist shape. The choices below were considered in our work for designing the desired response at the fractionally sampled rate, namely:\r\n	An impulse \r\n	A sampled raised cosine with a specific roll-off factor\r\n	Random Nyquist response achieved through constraining one of the down-sampled phase choices among the available T/m,2T/m,â€¦mT/m , to be an impulse \r\nAmong these choices, we show that choice (iii) lowers the symbol MSE to the minimum. In the next part of the talk, we study low-complexity recursive methods to solve the above least squares problem built over channel estimates for the various design choices in the fractionally spaced model.\r\n	First, we show how the conventional RLS and NLMS equalizers can be used when channel estimates are available. However, with RLS, the complexity scales in order of O(K^3 ) operations per received sample, which is of the same order as the KÃ—K matrix inverse, where K is the order of equalizer. This can be brought down to O(K^2 ), the same complexity when NLMS is applied here, using a novel low-complex channel estimate-based RLS equalizer. However, all these methods suffer from excess MSE compared to the optimal linear solution.\r\n	Next, we describe a dichotomous coordinate descent (DCD) adaptive channel estimate-based linear equalizer. This approach tries to recursively populate autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices without doing any explicit matrix multiplications of O(N_u (K+M)) and solve the linear system equations using DCD with O(N_u K) per sample, where M and N_u are the number of channel taps and DCD iterations, respectively. Typically, N_uâ‰ªK. This approach is scalable to fractionally spaced cases when the desired response is only an impulse. \r\n	Finally, for the new proposed target as in (iii), a recursive computation of correlation matrices without explicit matrix multiplications has been developed to solve that linear system of equations through DCD. This approach is scalable to higher sampling rates as well. Along with this, the fact that channel estimator length increases with m, the complexity of estimating channel adaptively has been limited to O(N_u M_S )  operations per sample irrespective of the over-sampling factor, where M_S being the number of channel taps at the symbol rate.      \r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/ijy-uoab-sfp','','',1,'2024-07-24 10:12:14','Active'),(959,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Data-centric Performance Enhancement of Vision-Language Models for Downstream Tasks ','Mr. Kartik Vishnu Hegde (EE21S005) ','MS Scholar','Guide: Dr. A.

Large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have been developed to address a variety of downstream tasks, such as Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA), Visual Grounding, Text-to-Video retrieval, etc. Traditionally, improving the performance of these models involves either developing more sophisticated architectures or training the models with vast amounts of high-quality paired data, both of which are resource-intensive and computationally demanding. In this thesis, we propose methods to enhance the performance of VLMs for vision-language downstream tasks by utilizing data effectively without the need for retraining the model from scratch. Our approach focuses on leveraging existing pre-trained VLMs and fine-tuning them with strategic data augmentation and efficient data processing techniques. We demonstrate that by carefully curating and utilizing data, it is possible to achieve significant improvements in model performance. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our methods surpass baseline performance on benchmark datasets for tasks such as Text-to-Video retrieval and Visual Question Answering. Specifically, our approach achieves notable gains in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of data-centric enhancements over conventional training-heavy methodologies.

The hidden scalars corresponding to the variables evolve according to discrete-time linear stochastic dynamics dictated by the underlying influence graph whose nodes are the variables.

The adapted algorithm can learn the influence graph based on the binary observations using logarithmic (in number of variables or nodes) samples when the degree of the influence graph is bounded. The crucial analytical contribution of this work is the derivation of the sample complexity result by upper and lower bounding the rate of convergence of the observed Markov process with memory to its stationary distribution in terms of the parameters of the influence graph.

In the year 2018 alone, domestic M&A activity was about 4.5% of Indiaâ€™s GDP. Given the size and significance of M&A, it has garnered considerable attention from academia and regulators. M&Aâ€™s results in changes to ownership structure and top management which in turn affects agency cost. Therefore, exploring the changes in the agency cost in the context of M & A would be quite relevant in the current context. Agency cost can be defined as a â€˜conflict of interest between various stakeholders in the firm. Further, it is argued that acquisition of a target can possibly have an impact on post-M&A agency cost of the acquirer. Therefore, the first objective of this study is to examine the impact of acquirer and target characteristics (ownership structure and financial characteristics) on post-acquisition agency cost. The findings indicate that nature of stake acquired (controlling and non-controlling stake), monitoring by foreign promoters and domestic promoters of target companies play a crucial role in influencing post-acquisition agency cost. \r\nIn addition to identifiable variables, board also plays a crucial role in managing the agency cost after acquisition. Further, in Indian context, board members play a moderating role between shareholders and managers. As per a report by Korn Ferry (a management consulting firm), majority of board members stand to lose their board seats during M&A which affects their ability to effectively monitor the managers. Therefore, the second objective of this study is to examine the role of board in influencing post-acquisition agency cost. The findings indicate that board characteristics such as board size, board independence, CEO Duality and directors holding multiple directorships affects post-acquisition variedly depending on the nature of stake acquired.\r\nPost-acquisition agency cost plays a detrimental role, and it is a precursor for managers of the acquiring company to engage in earnings management (EM). Therefore, the third objective is to examine the impact of ownership structure and board characteristics on earnings management. The findings indicate that earnings management practices of acquirers are affected by nature of stake acquired, board characteristics such as board size, directors holding multiple board positions, number of committee positions held by directors. Further, institutional shareholders also affect EM variedly based on nature of stake acquired.\r\n\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','SEMINAR - II (RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM)-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-25 10:23:43','Active'),(967,'','News Letter',NULL,'test',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'test','test','test','tets',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-25 10:38:28','default_value'),(968,'','Announcement of Quarters',NULL,'test',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'test','test@iitm','test','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-25 10:45:07','default_value'),(969,NULL,'Circular',NULL,'de',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'dew','cdc','cd','c',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-25 10:54:05','default_value'),(970,NULL,'Citation',NULL,'test',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'d','w','edw','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-25 10:57:10','default_value'),(971,'','Vaccination',NULL,'test',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'dxsss','xs','xx','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-25 10:59:37','default_value'),(972,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Development of Biomedical Image Analysis Methods for modelling Patient-Specific Cerebral Aneurysms','Ms. Azhaganmaadevi K A (AM19D037) ','Guide(s): Dr. B S V Prasad Patnaik & Dr. B Jayanand Sudhir (SCTIMST)','Ph.D. research scholar, Dept. of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras','Department of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering','2024/07/29 15:00','2024-07-29','yes','Online meeting link: https://meet.google.com/tkd-vgqb-ctx ','Cerebral aneurysms occur as balloon-like out-pouchings in an artery. When aneurysms are detected, understanding the risk of rupture is of immense clinical value. Resolving relevant coupled effects using Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) tools can improve our understanding of the mechanics behind aneurysm initiation, progression, and rupture. To this end, development of accurate computational models with a patient-specific geometric description is critical to hemodynamic analysis.  Currently, the geometric models for the CFD studies rely on imaging the flow-domain using Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) or Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), which limits accurate discerning of the vessel wall thickness for FSI studies. Ex-vivo imaging (Histopathology or micro-CT) of a surgically resected cerebral aneurysm, could provide the accurate wall-thickness information. However, generating an in vivo wall thickness description in conjunction with CT data is a challenge. The present proposal combines both the shape information of the 3D lumen model (as it existed in vivo), in conjunction with the wall thickness information extracted ex vivo. Representative patient-specific fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations are proposed to demonstrate the superiority of patient-specific wall thickness models as against uniform wall modelling.

AoI (often referred to as â€™Ageâ€™ for simplicity) is the time elapsed since the generation of the latest successfully received update at the destination. Specifically, at time t, if the monitor received an update with time-stamp u(t), AoI is the random process âˆ†(t) = t âˆ’ u(t). AoI can be analyzed by modeling status update systems as queuing systems. AoI is helpful in many applications like fire alarms,  autonomous driving, the stock market, remote health monitoring, Google Maps, aviation etc.,.\r\n\r\nIn our scenario, a source sends regular status updates to a remote monitor. With parallel servers between the source and destination, packets often arrive out of order, complicating analysis using existing methods. In our seminar, we will present the Relative Freshness Stochastic Hybrid System (RF-SHS-MC) method, which defines the discrete states of the stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) Markov Chain using the relative freshness of packets in a queuing system. This method identifies obsolete packets on the server as well as packets that can improve AoI (either fresh packets or older packets that can still enhance AoI), thereby simplifying SHS analysis compared to current methods.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the RF-SHS-MC method, we will also discuss the POPMAN approach, which optimizes server resources by identifying and removing outdated packets before they reach the monitor. This approach enables servers to manage incoming packets more efficiently, despite the additional signal overhead and increased system complexity. Furthermore, it ensures that packets are received in order at the receiver.\r\n\r\nWe have analyzed a heterogeneous server queuing system using the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) discipline with the POPMAN approach and compared it to the conventional FCFS approach. Our focus includes two types of FCFS queuing disciplines: 1) FCFS with a work-conservative policy, and 2) FCFS with a probabilistic routing policy. Additionally, we have conducted a similar analysis for the Last-Come, First-Served (LCFS) queuing system. In the seminar, we will discuss key conclusions from our research and explore future directions.\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/iuh-fmgg-qip  ','','',1,'2024-07-26 04:14:04','Active'),(981,'','Promotion',NULL,'test',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'test','test','test@iitm.ac.in','test',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-26 04:17:45','default_value'),(982,'','Recognition',NULL,'fdgg',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'dgfdf','dd','dd','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-26 04:22:16','default_value'),(983,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Separation Mechanism Characterization and Life Enhancement Studies in Lug Joint','Mr. Ramanath MN','Ph.D Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering.','Dr. Murthy H S N - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/07/26 15:30','2024-07-26','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/asb-icoy-nuc','','',1,'2024-07-26 04:31:32','Active'),(984,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- நிலை ஆணை (nilai aanai) \r\nHindi word	- स्थायी आदेश (sthaayee aadesh)\r\nEnglish word	- Standing Order\r\n','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-26 04:45:15','default_value'),(985,'','News Letter',NULL,'test',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'test','test','test@iitm.ac.in','test',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-26 04:45:17','default_value'),(986,'','News Letter',NULL,'test',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'test','test','test@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-26 04:49:10','default_value'),(987,'','News Letter',NULL,'test',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'test','test','sanand@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-26 04:52:46','default_value'),(988,'','Announcement',NULL,'Conference Announcement: Quantum Communication, Measurement and Computing (QCMC 2024)',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Dear all,\r\n\r\nThe Center for Quantum Information, Communication and Computing (CQuICC) at IIT Madras is hosting the 16th International Conference on Quantum Communication, Measurement and Computing (QCMC 2024) from 26th to 30th August : https://quantum.iitm.ac.in/qcmc24/\r\n\r\nQCMC 2024 brings together an exciting line up of national and international experts in the field.

The spatially separated charges results in reduced overlap of hole and electron wave functions which results imparting these IX large lifetime ~ 100 of ns. Moreover this charge separation results in static out of plane dipoles which repel each other as exciton density is increased. This dipole-dipole interaction allows to control the optical and transport properties of the IXs by external electric field. The large lifetime and dipolar repulsion provides platform to explore many body effects such as BEC and superfluity as well as the application in optoelectronics devices. 2D materials with diverse choices of semiconducting materials and freedom to stack them together to form heterostructures makes them excellent platform to study IXs. Significant development has happened towards the realization and manipulation of the IXs in different combinations of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterobilayers. However in these heterostructures, as band extrema of the constituent monolayers are located at the K point, momentum allowed transitions are very sensitive to lattice mismatch and twist angle between the constituent materials. Here we explore two materials (multilayer WS2 and PbI2) whose band extrema are at the Brillion zone center and show that IX in these heterostructure becomes twist angle independent. Importantly, IX intensity due to momentum matching becomes intense even at room temperature. PL of IXs have characteristics signatures such as, ( i) red shifted emission with respect to that of intralayer excitons of the constituent materials, (ii) blue shift and saturation of the emission peak with increasing laser power due to dipolar interaction, (iii) Stark shift of the emission peak under external electric field, (iv) long lifetime. We have shown that using different thicknesses of WS2, the emission energy of the IXs can be tuned from 1.70 eV to 1.45 eV in technologically relevant band for the free space communication.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n(1) Jiang, Y., Chen, S., Zheng, W., Zheng, B. & Pan, A.

This study aims to study the wear resistance of cold-sprayed Ni-based coatings (IN718 and Ni-20Cr) used in repair applications with and without reinforcement of Tribaloy 400 (T400) particles. The T400 reinforced Ni-based alloy coatings were obtained by spraying mechanically mixed T400 powder with IN718 powder and Ni-20Cr. The resulting coatings showed that T400 particles were unevenly distributed within the Ni alloy matrix, with many rebounding during deposition. Despite lower retention, these rebounding particles improved coating characteristics and reduced the porosity, surface roughness, and increased the adhesion strength. This enhancement, along with additional microstrain and the presence of T400, led to higher hardness in the composite coatings compared to pure Ni-alloy. Sliding wear tests at room temperature and 600Â°C demonstrated that the composite coatings had significantly higher wear resistance due to increased hardness and the load-bearing effect of the T400 reinforcement. The wear rate of the composite coating showed a maximum reduction of ~90 % at RT and 71 % at 600 Â°C.

Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond has shown tremendous potential for both spin- and photon-based quantum applications. However, controlling the optical emission from the defect and the ability to couple it to photonic structures is an important challenge for technologies based on NV or other promising quantum defects in diamond. In my Ph.D., I have worked on both theoretical and experimental aspects related to creating photonic structures that eventually will be useful for applications such as single photon emitters, sensitive magnetometers, and the creation of diamond quantum photonic chips. \r\nI will first discuss the metasurface we have designed [1] that can improve the emission from NV centers. Our design relies on exploiting the Mie resonance and Kerker conditions. It enables a more robust structure with highly directional emission, enhanced overall emission, and enhancement of emission in the zero-phonon line of NV by 100s of times. All these properties are crucial for various applications. Then, I will discuss our efforts in understanding the micromachining of photonic structures in diamond using a femtosecond (fs) laser. Light-based structuring can have many advantages, including creation of buried waveguides. While single NV defect creation and some limited structuring work using fs-laser have been demonstrated, greater control of these processes is needed [2]. Towards this, we have conducted non-linear transmission measurements to understand the changes to diamond structure due to fs-laser. I will present these results, which should directly inform the controlled creation of NV centers as well as the creation of photonic structures in diamond. \r\nFinally, time permitting, I will present our work on the design of an efficient and sensitive low-photon flux detector by exploiting Mie and guided-mode resonance. This includes Si-based detector operating at 810 nm and InGaAs based detector operating at 1550 nm, achieving around 90% absorption within ultra-thin (<100 nm) absorbers and reducing dark current by two orders of magnitude compared to conventional designs [3]. \r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n\r\n[1] 	Chowdhury, S., et al., \"Resonant structure for improved directionality and extraction of single photons,\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.04197 (2024).\r\n[2] 	Giakoumaki, A.

For better-integrating capability and better performance CMOS Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) technology has emerged over the past few years as the dominant technology for RF switches due to its significantly lower parasitic capacitance, higher power handling capability and better linearity. The influence of device parameters and device phenomena on RF-SPST (Single Pole Single Throw) switch figure of merits (FOM) and the trade-offs among these parameters to achieve better performance have been presented through simulation in 130 nm SOI technology. The impact of body potential on RF switch FOMs and the floating body phenomena observed in body-contacted FETs (specially for devices having T-body contact and larger finger width (wf)) used in RF switch stack has been briefly analyzed through simulation. The appropriate choice of wf and number of fingers (nf) for achieving good small signal and large signal performance by minimizing the floating body effect have been analyzed.\r\nThe conventional gate and body floating resistive biasing technique and stacking of transistors used in RF switches is not suitable for larger power handling capability (Pmax).

The simulation results demonstrate that the Pmax improves by 5 dBm and 5.25 dBm in 1st scheme and 2nd scheme respectively as compared to the conventional biasing for a 1 mm, 18 stack shunt SPST switch in OFF state.

These materials have a wide range of potential applications, from noise reduction and soundproofing to innovative uses in medical imaging and acoustic cloaking. Acoustic metamaterials derive their properties from their structure, which is designed at scales smaller than the wavelength of sound.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the work focuses on reducing sound waves using a sub-wavelength structure that relies on resonators. This addresses mid to high-frequency sounds ranging from 800 to 5000 Hz. Multiple quarter-wave resonators are organized in parallel configurations to achieve a high absorption coefficient. The next section introduces a new structure to generate a truncated acoustical Bessel beam, which is highly regarded for its non-diffractive and self-healing properties. Sonic crystals are arranged in an axicon shape to produce a Bessel-like beam with a large depth of field. The final phase involves a passive absorber designed to manage combustion instability, which is an undesirable aspect of any combustion system. Based on metamaterials, this passive absorber is introduced to mitigate these instabilities in the combustion system.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nDasila, Santosh, Chitti Venkata Krishnamurthy, and V.

However, in recent years, premature deterioration of such structures due to corrosion of the embedded steel strands has been observed within 10 to 20 years.  Corrosion in PSC structures is more crucial than that in conventionally reinforced concrete structures, as it can lead to stress-corrosion-cracking and catastrophic failure.  The critical service life of the PSC structures depends on the time to corrosion initiation; the propagation period is very minimal in such structures. However, there are difficulties in detecting the corrosion in PSC structures, as the corrosion is insidious.  Also, increased usage of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) and a considerable variation in the concentration of elements in prestressing steel resulted in increased diversity of the PSC systems.  Hence, this study focuses on assessing the suitability of existing methods to detect corrosion initiation in prestressed concrete, the challenges associated with electrochemical data interpretation, and the effect of corrosion on mechanical properties of strands.  A detailed review of relevant literature and research gaps will be presented.  Preliminary results on the passivation behaviour of prestressed steel in slag, suitability of electrochemical methods for understanding the evolution of passivation and to detect corrosion initiation will be discussed.  The challenges associated with performing and choosing appropriate test parameters for electrochemical tests in field specimens will be presented.  Also, preliminary results on the effect of corrosion on the transmission length and microstructural studies on stress corrosion cracking will be presented.

Both volatile and non-volatile resistive switching behavior are observed which can mimic the biological neural and synaptic functions. Temperature dependent transport studies of the conducting filament reveals the intrinsic nature of the conducting path formation.

Feeling different from the dominant workplace culture, such as being a woman in a male-dominated environment or having a hidden stigmatised sexual orientation or gender identity, can result in minority stress and increased vulnerability to loneliness due to perceived or actual social network marginalisation. Workplace loneliness (WL) is surging and is affecting employeesâ€™ performance, which in turn is causing severe, impalpable trouble to organisations. It is important to study loneliness in vulnerable groups to expand the understanding of the antecedents and outcomes and to isolate effective treatments, coping strategies and interventions to alleviate the distress of feeling lonely in the workplace.\r\n\r\nBased on this, this work attempts to explore the phenomenon of WL through the lens of LGBTQIA++ employees and primary caregiving women employees in Indian workplaces. We study procedural injustice, low sense of power and coworker incivility as the potential antecedents of WL and negative work rumination, silence behaviour and lack of innovative work behaviour as the potential outcomes of feeling lonely for primary caregiving women employees, with rejection sensitivity and self-efficacy as boundary conditions. This work also tries to understand what LGBTQIA++ employees note as the reasons for feeling lonely at work and its perceived consequences through in-depth semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, based on the findings of these two studies, we identify effective strategies for coping with WL by leveraging the perspectives and insights of mental health professionals through focus group discussions. The findings of this work can help and assist the decision-makers in understanding what exacerbates employee loneliness, which leads to various behavioural changes. It can also serve as a reference for organisations while formulating a set of policies to address the inequality faced by marginalised groups. Understanding the factors aggravating workplace loneliness in these two marginalised groups will help mental health workers and employee assistance counsellors provide effective interventions and coping strategies.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','RESEARCH PROPOSAL SEMINAR-web confernce link-','','',1,'2024-07-30 03:19:50','Active'),(1002,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\"Transition-Metal Catalysed Cyanation of Aryl (Pseudo)Halidesâ€','Ms. Dhanalakshmi M (CY15D069)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide- Professor Anbarasan, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/08/05 15:00','2024-08-05','yes','CB-310, Chemistry Seminar Hall','Aryl nitriles are an important building unit in organic synthesis and are generally present as a key moiety in various products, such as, pharmaceuticals, dyes, agrochemicals and so on. Indeed, nitrile group serves as an important synthetic functionality for transforming into a wide range of functional groups. The traditional methods known for the synthesis of aryl nitriles include the  Rosenmund-von-Braun reaction and Sandmeyer reaction. However, both the reaction suffers from critical drawbacks. The best alternative for the preparation aryl nitriles is the transition-metal catalysed cyanation of aryl halides.[1] In this approach, the cyanating reagents employed are mainly metal-bound cyanide sources, such as, NaCN, KCN, Zn(CN)2, TMSCN, CuCN, K4[Fe(CN)6]. Although metal-catalysed cyanation reactions have attractive features, they also have drawbacks, like high catalyst loading, toxicity associated with cyanides, etc.[3] To overcome the above-mentioned problems, the use of non-metallic cyano-group sources, such as cyanohydrin, alkyl nitriles, malononitrile, phenyl cyanate, cyanamides as well as molecules without CN group have been shown to be effective CN sources for aromatic cyanation reactions. Alternatively, oximes have also been utilized in the synthesis of aryl/alkyl nitriles. In this seminar, the various cyanating reagents will be outlined along with their benefits and drawbacks when it comes to transition metal catalysis.[2,4] Afterwards, our hypothesis and research objectives will be proposed.\r\n         \r\n','CY OFFICE','cyoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','ALL ARE WELCOME-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-30 04:35:36','Active'),(1003,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Second Born Electrons and Rescue at Sea','Prof. A Ravi P Rau','Prof. Ravi Rau obtained his BSc (Hons) and MSc in Physics from Delhi University.

In mainstream Hollywood, representations of childhood often create \'hyperreal\' idealizations of innocence, vulnerability, and dependency, portraying children as embryonic adults. Drawing on the theories of Jean Baudrillard, Pierre Bourdieu, Fredric Jameson, and Judith Butler, this study deconstructs the representational strategies underlying the depiction of childhood in selected independent films. By situating the child within the familial context, it views the family as an emblematic microcosm reflecting broader American societal dynamics. This approach unpacks the regulatory power structures and ideological interplay inherent within the familial domain, revealing the complexities of representing childhood agency, autonomy, and subjectivity amidst shifting cultural paradigms.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndependent cinema emerges as a transformative site in the cinematic treatment of childhood, advocating for an alternative, more accommodating, and empowering imagery. These films reject mainstream cinema\'s nostalgic urge to totalize childhood under the innocent ideal, presenting instead a \'whole\' idea of the child with a complex and nuanced identity that engages with the anxieties and violence of the contemporary adult world. Transitioning beyond binary oppositions and outdated assurances of parental ideology, independent films embody a chaotic blend of qualities. By critically emphasizing the social field or habitus of child characters, this study positions childhood images as products and instruments of social relations rather than as artifacts and self-contained abstractions. It reiterates the significance of casting childhood figurations within the mass production of bodily images, identities, and the hegemonic social landscapes that shape them.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Child figure, American Independent Cinema, Agency, American Dream, American Family.','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/aek-icrc-ntj ','','',1,'2024-07-30 09:23:50','Active'),(1010,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','\"Tales of Tortured Ecstasy: Curiosity, Chance and Studies on Solid State Materials\"','Professor Srinivasan Natarajan','Professor, Solid State and Structural Chemistry Unit, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore','Professor Sanjay Kumar, Head of the Department','Department of Chemistry','2024/08/02 16:00','2024-08-02','yes','CB-310, Chemistry Seminar Hall','It is commonly believed that materials science derives its nourishment and impetus mainly from the market forces.

Infact, PRACH is the first uplink signal transmitted by the UE, which let\'s the base station know that there exists a user trying to access it\'s services. The UE generates a zadoff-chu sequence from the available pool of sequences, appends a cyclic shift to it and then transmits it. Upon reception, the BS correlates the sequence with the available zadoff-chu sequences in the pool. If the received sequence matches with any of the available sequences at the base station, this results in a sharp peak. The position of the peak determines the cyclic shift that was applied at the UE. Also, we decode another parameter called timing advance, which essentially is a function of the distance between the UE and the BS. From the position of the peak, we also estimate the timing advance, which is sent back to the UE. The UE uses this timing advance command and adjusts it\'s uplink transmission timing, thus establishing uplink time synchronization. In this Work, i) We have developed an algorithm for reception and decoding of PRACH signal and verified it via matlab simulations ii) Implemented the algorithm on the FPGA, which is a part of our customised base band unit. iii) Multiple real time tests have been carried out using a 5G NR mobile phone to check the functioning of our PRACH receiver.\r\n\r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/gfk-hyox-ibe','','',1,'2024-07-30 10:09:42','Active'),(1012,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Road Condition Monitoring with Accelerometer usingTransformer Model','Mano S  Roll No : (ch22s022)','Mano S  Roll No : (ch22s022)','Dr. Raghunathan Rengaswamy (Guide)','Department of Chemical Engineering','2024/07/31 15:30','2024-07-31','yes','online','Road infrastructure maintenance is essential for efficient transportation and to maintain safety for vehicles and humans. Detection and identification of road anomalies and obstacles in the road have been investigated by the research community using different types of sensors. Accurate information on road profiles could be useful to road infrastructure managers to monitor the quality of the road surface and to initialize prioritized repairing of road segments, which will reduce the impact of poor road conditions on vehicles and humans.  Accelerometer sensors embedded in vehicles provide continuous and high-resolution data, capturing the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the road surface. Traditional methods for analyzing this data often rely on handcrafted features and machine learning algorithms, which can be limited in their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies and spatial patterns. \r\nThis work uses an Inertial Measurement unit installed in bikes to collect the accelerometer and gyroscope data, which is used to identify different types of road anomalies.  Inspired by the success of Transformer models in multiple domains, this work investigates the application of it in identifying anomalies in multivariate time series. The transformer model\'s self-attention mechanism allows it to capture long-range dependencies and intricate patterns in the accelerometer data, making it well-suited for this task. We first preprocess the accelerometer data to remove noise and segment it into fixed-length segments. Each window is then fed into the transformer model, which outputs a classification label for the corresponding road segment. We classified road segments of IITM into three different categories based on the accelerometer and gyroscope data . The results show that the transformer model achieves superior accuracy and robustness in classifying road segments, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications.

It involves sending data modulated over a laser, which travels in free space. It requires a line of sight (LOS) between the transmitter and receiver. This LOS tend to get misaligned due to various atmospheric effects, effectively due to random changes in the refractive index. FSO requires an alignment system to maintain this LOS.\r\n\r\nThis work presents a lock-in amplifier (LIA) based alignment system. To compensate for the LOS misalignments, the laser beam is steered at the transmitter side based on the feedback from the receiver side, which is sent via a wireless RF link. The receiver decides the direction of steering using a steepest gradient descent (SGD) based algorithm. An in-house built LIA is used at the receiver to detect the weak optical signals affected by the atmosphere. The LIA increased the receiverâ€™s sensitivity by 11 dB. The alignment system is tested to recover a misaligned link indoors at distances of up to 80 m and outdoors at a 150 m link distance. The tests were done with manually misaligned links, simulating beam displacement, and on atmosphere-induced misaligned links.\r\n\r\nIn the outdoor setup, a bit error rate of 1E-11 was obtained after recovering a manually misaligned link. In the indoor setup at 80 m, the FSO link without our alignment system experienced a power loss of 19 dB over a period of 1 hour due to atmospheric misalignments. When our system was employed, it partially corrected these misalignments and reduced the power loss to 8 dB.\r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-30 11:15:01','Active'),(1014,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- பணி ஓய்வு (pani oyvu) \r\nHindi word	- सेवानिवृत्ति (sevaanivrutthi)\r\nEnglish word	- Retirement','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-07-31 04:34:50','default_value');

In the long run, if untreated, it leads to organ failure, severely low blood pressure, and septic shock. Compared to other localized microbial infections, sepsis has a distinct host response and needs immediate treatment. Identifying early signs and starting the right therapy is the key to reducing the high mortality rate of sepsis. The current method to diagnose sepsis is a gold-standard blood culture method. This is followed by an antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) using the broth microdilution method. Unfortunately, blood culture analysis takes 1.5â€“5 days to resolve, which leads to extensive delays in starting the evidence-based antibiotic treatment. Lack of quick diagnostics is a major obstacle to treating sepsis and antibiotic resistance because it causes either the overuse of first-line antibiotics or an extended gap in giving the right antibiotic or medication. Rapid and sensitive antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) is essential to treat high-morbidity sepsis, particularly in emerging antimicrobial resistance. Apart from this, it is crucial to continuously monitor the host immune response to understand the treatment progress. Hence, there is a need for both rapid AST determination and monitoring host response using biomarkers at point-of-care (POC) diagnostics to enable personalized treatment for better sepsis management. Towards this end, we will develop a point-of-care microfluidic device for rapid and sensitive antimicrobial susceptibility testing of patient blood and paper-based biomarker detection to check immune response.\r\n Also, in one of the main pathophysiological mechanisms of sepsis, activated innate immune system cells trigger coagulation, which leads to clot formation and microvascular immunothrombosis. Although various types of anticoagulant therapeutic drugs have been tested in clinical trials, their therapeutic effects are not effective, and they are also associated with a high risk of haemorrhage. Understanding the underlying processes and cellular interactions in sepsis-related thrombosis is critical for finding novel therapeutic targets. In this direction, to understand the mechanism of thrombus formation during septic shock, we will mimic the in-vivo disease condition in a microfluidic device using organ-on-chip. The developed in-vitro microfluidic model will provide a platform to understand the interaction between different types of cells during disease conditions and the mechanism behind disease progression. Also, it will help to identify novel therapeutic targets. \r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-31 05:01:09','Active'),(1016,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','\" High temperature deformation of refractory BCC superalloys \"','Prof. Martin Heilmaier','Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute for Applied Materials (IAM-WK), Germany.','Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute for Applied Materials (IAM-WK), Germany.','Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering','2024/08/09 16:00','2024-08-09','yes','Seminar Hall (NAC 222) , KCB.','Refractory high entropy alloys (RHEA), composed of high melting, passivating, and lightweight elements, show great promise for high-temperature structural applications [1]. They have demonstrated exceptional properties surpassing those of Ni-based superalloys and other refractory alloys, such as remarkable high-temperature strength and superior corrosion resistance. However, the crucial aspect of creep resistance, essential for structural materials at elevated temperatures, has only been briefly addressed. A recent study by Gadelmeier et al. [2] investigated the tensile creep behavior of body-centered cubic (BCC) TiZrHfNbTa RHEA with a single-phase, polycrystalline microstructure at 980 Â°C and 1100 Â°C. The creep resistance at both temperatures was notably lower than that of a state-of-the-art, precipitation-strengthened, single-crystal Ni-based superalloy (CMSX-4). This discrepancy is attributed to phase decomposition during creep deformation and the BCC crystal structure of the alloy. Therefore, achieving a precipitation-strengthened condition is imperative for RHEA to exhibit competitive creep performance.\r\n\r\nOur alloy design approach in the Ta-Mo-Ti-Cr-Al system has confirmed the existence of a two-phase microstructure with a disordered A2 matrix and ordered B2 precipitates in a certain compositional range, mimicking that of Ni-based super alloys [3,4]. Hence, it may be called a BCC superalloy. The formation of B2 in 82(Ta-Mo-Ti)-8Cr-10Al (in at.%) occurs through nucleation and growth-mediated precipitation, with a notably high solvus temperature of approximately 1050Â°C. Additionally, it maintains a stable ultrafine particle microstructure even after prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures. These findings suggest promising prospects for achieving creep resistance in this alloy. Consequently, we present the current status of investigations into the high temperature deformation behavior of this BCC superalloy. Compression creep tests were conducted at elevated temperatures close to the solvus temperature and above, with varying constant true stresses to unveil the creep deformation behavior and underlying mechanisms. Subsequently, SEM/TEM were employed to examine the deformed micro structures at different creep strains. The discussion will encompass the impact of the coherent interface between the matrix and precipitates.','MME OFFICE 2','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-07-31 06:06:59','Active'),(1017,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','On the Central Bankâ€™s Communication and its Impact on Financial and Commodity Markets','Mr. Amar Jyoti (HS16D002)','PhD Research Scholar, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras.','Dr. Pramod Kumar Naik (Guide), Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras.','Department of Humanities and Social Sciences','2024/08/06 15:30','2024-08-06','yes','Google meet','The use of central bank communication to manage the expectations of the economic agents and anchor inflation has been on the rise worldwide. Given this background, we investigate how central bank communication, namely speeches, impacts the volatility associated with the financial market. Our sample examined the speeches of three central banks - the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Reserve Bank of India. We study the impact of the sentiment conveyed by the central bank speeches on the equity market volatility on the days of the speech and the next day. We used a lexicon-based dictionary approach to measure the sentiment, which also considered the context by accounting for valence shifters. We have observed that the speech sentiment is negatively associated with the equity market volatility measured by VIX. The result is robust to the speech controls (readability measures) and the requisite financial and macroeconomic variables. This study provides empirical evidence that the financial market participants observe the central banks\' speeches, and it impacts the volatility associated with the equity markets.

The two distinct phases under consideration are the cell and aqueous phases. We use the thin-film approximation, as the characteristic height of the swarm is significantly lower than its characteristic radius. Our model incorporates surfactant generation by microorganisms, drag forces between the cell and aqueous phases, osmotic influx, and Marangoni stresses. The disjoining pressure is included to account for substrate wettability, and a precursor film is employed to address the contact line singularity. Several morphologies of bacterial swarms, such as arrested, circular, modulated, branching, droplet, fingering, and dendrite have been observed experimentally. The model developed is capable of predicting all these shapes. We observed that an increase in the wettability of the substrate leads to faster expansion, whereas increased surface tension promotes radial redistribution of swarm. The role of biomass growth and surfactant production rate, surfactant diffusivity, and osmotic influx on the morphology of bacterial swarm colonies is explored. \r\nIn the second part, we investigate the growth kinetics of bacterial biofilms on porous substrates. Most earlier studies have presented a two-phase model for these systems where they have combined two phases into a single phase depending on whether the biofilm is characterized by a high or low ECM volume fraction. In this work, a general three-phase model is developed, which explicitly accounts for the cell phase, extracellular matrix (ECM), and nutrient-rich aqueous phase. This can predict biofilms, which are both rich and lean in ECM. Here, again, we use the thin-film approximation. We use a 2D axisymmetric model to capture biofilm growth on a porous agar substrate. Our model accounts for osmotic flux and predicts the spatiotemporal variations of the volume fractions of the different phases and the nutrient concentrations in the biofilm and the substrate. An increase in surface tension helps redistribute biomass radially. Our model captures the behavior of different kinds of biofilms: films characterized by low (yeast) and high (bacterial) ECM content. In our approach, we also consider the diffusional resistance of nutrients within both the substrate and the biofilm. This makes our model more realistic, as nutrient diffusion plays a crucial role in biofilm expansion. The predictions of our model are quantitatively validated with the experimental data from the literature. Our model provides insights into the role of different parameters on biofilm growth, which can be used to develop strategies to prevent or accelerate biofilm formation on surfaces.\r\nThe growth of microorganisms is characterized by autocatalytic behavior. As a model system, we analyze a two-variable system governed by quadratic and cubic autocatalytic reactions in a porous media. Here, each species is involved in the autocatalytic generation of the other. We investigate the effect of subdiffusion on the stability of the steady states of the system. Critical surfaces are identified across which the bifurcation diagrams vary. We also developed a methodology to determine regions in parameter space where Turning patterns can be observed. The behavior in the different regions is verified by a robust implicit numerical method developed for nonlinear systems based on the L1 scheme. We find that subdiffusive effects increase the region of dynamic stability of the system.','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/bgi-vehj-ueu','seminar31-07-2024 09:08','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar31-07-2024 09:08',1,'2024-07-31 09:08:33','Active'),(1019,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Ph.D Seminar Talk - II - SEISMIC HAZARD IN INDIA','Ms. BHARGAVI PODILI, Roll No. CE20D752','Ph.D Scholar','Dr. Raghukanth S T G - Guide, Dr. Meher Prasad A - DC Member, Dr. Subhadeep Banerjee - DC Member, Dr. Shaikh Faruque Ali (AM) - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head','Civil Engineering','2024/08/01 15:00','2024-08-01','yes','BSB 368, Visveswaraya Seminar Hall (VSH), Second Floor','Appropriate design values that compensate the seismic hazard of the region are desired in an earthquake-resistant design, to mitigate the associated risk. The most commonly used technique for hazard estimation is the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). In this procedure, the hazard at a site is obtained through integration of various probabilities â€“ the probability of the site experiencing a certain level of ground motion and the probability of an earthquake that can result the same, etc. Obtaining these seemingly simple values is even more difficult for data sparse regions such as India, which also has one of the most complex seismic settings: The Himalayas. Moreover, currently, many of the components involved in PSHA does not reflect the nuanced traits of the Himalayas. \r\nTherefore, in the current thesis, novel methodologies with concrete theoretical framework are demonstrated, to obtain seismogenic source zones (for application in pre-PSHA) as well as a seismic zone map for India (for application in post-PSHA). Further, new ground motion models for the Acceleration response spectra (Sa), Fourier amplitude spectra (FAS) and V/H spectral ratio, are derived for the Himalayan region using various methodologies. In addition to developing a prediction model using just the regional data, the study also explores four alternative methodologies to derive a model that can circumvent the limitation of near field data shortage. Moreover, since physics-based PSHA is favoured for sites located near active faults, an alternative source model as well as a customized medium model for the central Himalayan region are also derived, to simulate ground motions. The source model, which is trained using a state-of-the-art generative adversarial network, predicts the random slip field without any prior assumptions on its distribution. On the other hand, the new computational model incorporates all the complexities of the Himalayan geology (anisotropic material properties and topographical features such as hills, valleys, basins etc.) and tectonics (faults and fault zones) in a cracked medium framework.\r\n','R.

Currently the AUVs are being powered by lithium-ion batteries (LIB) and have achieved technological maturity, availability, managed safety, and rechargeable characteristics. However, lithium batteries are not ideal energy storage systems for sea exploration due to their low energy density and high cost. Thus, significant interest has been attracted to the development of seawater batteries using natural seawater as an electrolyte suitable for working in the sea, owing to their high energy density, open construction, environmental friendly and other safety aspects. Seawater-based metal batteries rely on the oxidation of the reactive metal at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode. Metals such as Mg and Al are potential anodes for SWBs of which Mg is an excellent electrode material selected due to its high specific capacity (2200 mAh/g), low cost, and good electro- chemical activity in seawater.  On the other hand, cathodes are typically expensive; therefore, it is preferable to identify a less expensive alternative cathode.\r\nMany kinds of Mg-based batteries had been explored, such as magnesium seawater activated battery, magnesium/hydrogen peroxide semi-fuel cell and magnesium/dissolved oxygen battery (Mg/SW-O2). Among above batteries, the magnesium/dissolved oxygen battery is the only takes oxidant from seawater. Therefore, the magnesium/dissolved oxygen battery with high specific energy and relatively simple structure can be used in the marine application. However, the concentration of the dissolved oxygen in the ocean/sea restricts seriously the volume power density and limits its application in the broad ocean. It is proposed to study on the flow characteristics in semi-closed architecture in full stack configuration and the effect of cell performance with dissolved oxygen at lower current density. Further an alternative approach to overcome the oxygen limitations is to switch to a different oxygen source to meet the power density. While oxygen rich solution viz., H2O2 or various alternative electrolytes can be used in closed architecture and saltwater electrolyte is of choice in open architecture.\r\nMy goal is to assess both closed and open architectural cells, using Mg based dissolved oxygen sea water battery and other oxygen rich electrolytes with inert electrode to suit different power demands of AUVs.','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/add-ohsb-vmb','seminar31-07-2024 11:24','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar31-07-2024 11:24',1,'2024-07-31 11:24:42','Active'),(1022,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','â€œCO2 UTILIZATION REACTIONS USING MOFSâ€','MS.

We must design and implement Carbon dioxide Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) technologies to mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emission and move towards a carbon neutral or net zero economy. Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and their subclass Zeolitic Imidazole Frameworks (ZIFs) are effective materials for CO2 capture and show noteworthy catalytic activity owing to the presence of Lewis acidic metal centres and different functional groups on the linkers. ZIFs are found to be highly active for CO2 cycloaddition reaction with epoxides to produce cyclic carbonates in a solventless and co-catalyst free conditions. However, the active sites and reaction mechanisms for this transformation are still unclear to effectively develop commercially viable processes for such transformations. The catalytic performance of three different ZIFs, ZIF-8, ZIF-67 and ZIF-90 were analyzed to show the effect of different metal centres (Zn and Co), linker functionalities (polar and non-polar) and defect centres for the cycloaddition reaction. Among the investigated mechanisms, in the Lewis acid mechanism, the ring-opening of epoxide is facilitated by the Lewis acid-base pair (M-OH) while in the Br0nsted acid mechanism, it is facilitated by the N-H of the linker. On the ZIF surface, the higher Lewis acidity of the Co2+ than Zn2+ makes the epoxide ring opening, the first step in the cycloaddition reaction, more favourable on ZIF-67 with a low activation barrier of 0.64 eV. The Br0nsted acid mechanism shows ZIF-67 having comparatively lower ring opening barrier of 1.59eV, due to more basic mIm linker and ability of Co to stabilize the -ve charge formed after proton abstraction. These results are in alignment with experimental data which shows ZIF-67 to be the most active with 91% epoxide conversion and 95% cyclic carbonate selectivity. In future work the study will be extended to conversion of glycerol to glycerol carbonate using ZIFs to identify the active sites to develop better performing MOF to scale up the reaction. Furthermore, we observed difference in morphology and activity of ZIFs for cyclization reaction when ZIFs were synthesized in different solvents. Implicit solvation method will be used to understand the effect of solvents in nucleation or structural unit formation.','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/ich-racd-sdp','seminar01-08-2024 03:30','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar01-08-2024 03:30',1,'2024-08-01 03:30:26','Active'),(1023,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL',' Non-Parametric Multi-Target Data Association and Tracking for Multistatic Radars','Ms. Sruti S (EE18D705)','Ph.D Scholar,  Department of Electrical Engineering',' Guide: Dr. Giridhar K ','Electrical Engineering','2024/08/06 11:00','2024-08-06','yes','ESB 244/Online','\r\n\r\nMultistatic radar systems provide better detection performance for stealth airborne platforms and are resilient to single-point failures. However, when multiple targets are present over the radar surveillance region, incorrect target associations to the measurements could create ghost targets. Computationally efficient and accurate de-ghosting and tracking multiple targets are critical tasks in real-time distributed radar systems. By exploiting the geometry of the measurement model in the association process, a novel and efficient data association approach followed by a tracking algorithm called Non-Parametric Data Association and Tracking (NPDAT) is proposed. It utilizes the Time-of-Arrival and bistatic Doppler frequency measurements of the targets with respect to different transmitter-receiver pairs to accurately determine and track the 3D positions and velocities of the targets. The proposed approach is non-parametric as it does not need any assumption on the initial states or the number of targets and their motion models, but only uses the knowledge of the geometry of the radar sensors. The algorithm is tested with multiple targets in two significant scenarios: (i) all the targets are simultaneously present in the region, and (ii) targets arrive and depart the region based on a random arrival pattern. Our approach precisely tracks targets even during cross- over and also tracks fast-maneuvering targets. The algorithm is compared with popular existing methods and is shown to exhibit superior performance in estimation accuracy and maneuvering target tracking ability, even while enjoying a significantly lower time and implementation complexity.\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/zyb-bmwe-yah','','',1,'2024-08-01 04:04:22','Active'),(1024,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\"Sustainable chemistry through microdropletsâ€',' Mr. Sinchan Mukhopadhyay (CY21D053)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Pradeep T, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/08/06 16:30','2024-08-06','yes','CB-310, Chemistry Seminar Hall','Water microdroplets are important in diverse processes in nature, ranging from fog and cloud formation to sea spray aerosols.

Due to the above factors, microdroplets can show significant reaction acceleration and unusual chemistry. In this seminar, I will discuss how sustainable chemistry can be achieved through microdroplets, as they typically involve only room temperature, minimum reagents and no catalysis. \r\nReferences:\r\n[1] 	Yan, X., Bain, R.

Some transit agencies/applications disseminate real-time information to help reduce passenger waiting times. However, these solutions primarily focus on providing expected travel times, neglecting uncertainty quantification, and negatively affecting passenger experience when bus arrivals deviate from the expected times. Therefore, together with expected travel times, quantifying the associated uncertainties is vital for better travel planning and enhancing the reliability of transit systems. This study modelled bus route travel time for simultaneous real-time mean and reliability predictions, incorporating incomplete travel time information. In this pursuit, GPS data from public buses in Chennai is used to build several accelerated failure time (AFT) models duly accounting for censored bus trips (where data is only available for part of the trip). A two-parameter Weibull AFT model provided the best predictive performance with a logical hazard rate. The proposed model was benchmarked against existing alternative methods â€“ i) models optimized for mean, ii) a quantile regression reliability model, and iii) models disregarding incomplete data. The results revealed that while discarding incomplete data did not significantly affect the mean predictions, the reliability estimates were significantly biased throughout the trip. Incorporating censored information provided the best predictive performance, with an average coverage error of the forecasted travel time intervals not exceeding 0.43%. Furthermore, the influence of spatiotemporal, operational and traffic characteristics and their partial effect on the survival function were investigated. Spatial analysis unveiled the polychotomous nature of survival functions, which is explainable by the route lengths. In the temporal analysis, the effect of traffic congestion was observed, with survival probabilities of trips during peak hours being higher than in off-peak hours. The interpretability and accuracy of the proposed model make it a valuable tool for real-time travel time reliability predictions.','R.

The efficacy of current RA drugs is often compromised by their rapid clearance via the leaky vasculature and lymphatic drainage in the synovial membrane, leading to systemic toxicity (1). Conventional drug delivery vehicles, like nanoparticles, liposomes, and polymer-based carriers, have been explored to address these challenges. However, these systems often fall short of achieving precise targeting, resulting in limited therapeutic efficacy and continued systemic toxicity. To overcome this, drug delivery systems utilize disease-specific overexpressed receptors as targets and their corresponding ligands for conjugation and delivery of drugs, allowing site-specific release and reducing systemic toxicity. \r\nCurrent receptor choices majorly target the lymphocytes instead of restricting them to targets within the joint cavity. Hence, they fail to combine targeted and sustained drug delivery effectively, resulting in unwanted circulation and off-target effects. Peptide-based drug delivery systems address these limitations by offering site-specific drug release in a sustained manner. Collagen type II, predominantly found in the hyaline cartilage of joints, presents a promising target for RA therapies due to its unique localization and abundance in all the joint cartilage tissue matrices. Despite its potential, collagen type II-targeted drug delivery remains underexplored. Given this context, my thesis will focus on bridging this gap by synthesizing a collagen type II-targeted peptide-drug conjugate and evaluating its effectiveness for RA treatment. The proposed peptide-drug conjugate is designed to aid in both targeting precision and sustained release of small molecules, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes and reducing systemic toxicity. \r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','References 1.

Triboelectrification occurs when two materials come into contact with each other, causing charge transfer that leads to oppositely charged surfaces; the amount of charge transfer varies depending on material composition. By combining triboelectrification with electrostatic induction, relevant devices can be designed. If used for energy collection purposes, scientists generally refer to them as Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs); but if used for self-powered sensing purposes, scientists call them Triboelectric Nanosensors (TENSs). In our previous research on TENSs, we demonstrated the concept of selective detection of some targets by specific materials or their surfacemodified probes. When the targets are adsorbing or binding to the surface, different electrical output signals will be generated compared to before, and these changes can be used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the targets. In the past few years, we have further developed solid-liquid TENSs for measuring targets such as metal ions, small molecules, proteins, and microorganisms.

The advantages of CFS are its high strength-to-weight ratio, lightweight, easy to fabricate and erect, recyclable, no formwork, and fast dry-type construction. On the other hand, it is prone to various types of buckling modes, local, distortional, and global buckling, such as flexural, torsional, flexural-torsional, and lateral-torsional, and their interactive buckling modes, leading to design complications. However, the behavior of CFS frames under lateral cyclic loads is not adequately understood, and most of the past research focused on the cyclic lateral load behavior of shear wall panels and bolted moment frames. While wall panels cause obstruction, bolted moment frames fail by bolt bearing on CFS sections. A better system will be CFS latticed frames with screwed connections. This research study is focused on the behaviour of CFS lattice portal frames using CFS-lipped channels as chord members and CFS-lipped equal angles as web members, assuming the screwed connections are adequately designed. The unique cross-sections of single and doubly symmetric portal frames were developed for the experimental and numerical study. These lattice portal frames can resist higher values of bending moments, as there is a truss system with axially loaded members and relatively higher lever arms. Finite element analysis was carried out to understand the failure modes and cyclic performance of the frames, and it was found that the frames had adequate ductility and energy dissipation capacities to resist cyclic lateral loads. It is proposed that further parametric studies be carried out numerically and experimentally to arrive at recommendations for design.\r\n','Manikandan.

In the quantum domain, out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOCs) naturally emerge as a probe of quantum chaos, akin to classical LEs. We investigate OTOCs in a system that disobeys the celebrated Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem using rigorous numerical and mathematical techniques. Specifically, we consider a quantized kicked harmonic oscillator (KHO). As the harmonic oscillator is a non-KAM integrable system, even an extremely small time-dependent perturbation can drive the system chaotic. At specific points in the parameter space called resonances, the system undergoes large-scale structural changes in response to parameter variations. At resonances, we observe that the long-time dynamics of the OTOCs are sensitive to these structural changes, resulting in quadratic growth, as opposed to linear or stagnant growth at non-resonances. However, our findings suggest that the short-time dynamics remain relatively stable and exhibit the exponential growth found in the literature for unstable fixed points. We further analytically extract the â€œquantum Lyapunov exponentâ€ from the OTOC for a special case and demonstrate its exact correspondence with the corresponding classical LE. We will also discuss possible applications of such non-KAM system dynamics in quantum sensing. We then extend our OTOC studies to a finite-dimensional bipartite system known as kicked coupled tops, which have spin degrees of freedom. This system conserves total magnetization along the z-direction and has a smooth classical limit. A systematic study of OTOCs in this system provides (i) fresh insights into scrambling in mixed-phase spaceâ€”a domain that has not been comprehensively explored beforeâ€”and (ii) implications of conserved quantities on the scrambling of information. Finally, complementing the use of OTOCs to probe quantum chaos, we explore emergent higher-order state designs from many-body quantum states generated by chaotic Hamiltonians exhibiting symmetries when the states are partially measured in an appropriate basis. To this end, we identify a sufficient condition on the measurement basis for the efficient generation of higher-order designs. We demonstrate that this condition can be generalized to any arbitrary discrete or continuous symmetric cases. The emergence of designs signals deep thermalization in quantum systems, which lies beyond the purview of the conventional Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis.\r\n\r\n','HoD Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/nzv-sqgs-nix','','',1,'2024-08-02 10:56:48','Active'),(1032,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Risk Assessment of Offshore Topside under Hydrocarbon Fire','Ms. Pradeepa M, Roll No: OE20D009','Ms. Pradeepa M, Roll No: OE20D009, Ph.D Scholar','Prof. Srinivasan Chandrasekaran - Guide','Department of Ocean Engineering','2024/08/05 16:00','2024-08-05','','Department of Ocean Engineering , Seminar Hall','Given their substantial hydrocarbon inventories, offshore oil extraction and processing facilities are highly susceptible to fire hazards. Such incidents can result in the release of intense heat, smoke, and toxic gases, creating significant dangers for both the crew members and the structural integrity of the platform. Consequently, it is crucial to anticipate the fire load and the response of structural elements during the design phase while continuously monitoring the risk levels. This research focuses on calculating the fire load and heat release rate of a hydrocarbon fire on the topside of an offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Due to the vast size of the platform, the simulation is conducted in smaller sections rather than as a single entity. Fire load calculations are performed under various scenarios, considering differences in the location of the fire source and the types of fuel involved. The Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS), using Pyrosim, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation tool, is utilized to generate time-temperature curves. Mesh size selection is informed by a mesh convergence study, with finer meshes employed near fire sources to enhance result accuracy. Wind effects are also integrated into the analysis. The FDS simulation produces data on heat release rates and temperatures, which are subsequently input into Abaqus for a detailed examination of structural responses. A heat transfer analysis simulates the temperature at each node of the structure when exposed to fire. A thermal-structural analysis is conducted, considering the material properties at high temperatures. During the fire load analysis, structural elements are presumed to be influenced by environmental loads. The response of structural components at critical points, characterized by the highest temperatures and loads, is meticulously observed and discussed. The reliability of this estimation method is validated by comparing its results with those of previous studies, demonstrating a satisfactory level of consistency. The discussion highlights the fire resistance rating, which measures the risk associated with elevated temperatures.','oeoffice','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-02 11:03:10','Active'),(1033,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Tandem Queue Decomposition Plus: A Throughput-Optimal Routing Policy for Partially-Trusted-Node Quantum Key Distribution Networks',' Mr. Krishnakumar G (EE19D410)','Ph.D Scholar,  Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Venkatesh R\r\nCoGuide: Dr. Abhishek Sinha\r\n\r\n\r\n','Electrical Engineering','2024/08/05 15:00','2024-08-05','yes','Online (Googlemeet)','Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks have made significant strides in today\'s quantum technology landscape, particularly with the commercial implementation of point-to-point QKD networks. However, for long-range QKD networks, the prevailing approach still relies on the traditional \"Trusted Node/Relay\" setup. Huttner et al. (2022) demonstrated that, given current technological constraints, it is impossible to relax the trusted node assumption. Even our recent work, the Tandem Queue Decomposition Policy (TQD), which addresses secure and throughput-optimal routing in multi-hop QKD networks with generalized flows, adheres to this assumption.\r\n\r\nQKD networks ensure information-theoretic security by leveraging the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. However, trusted nodes within a QKD network, responsible for holding classical messages, represent vulnerabilities that eavesdroppers can exploit if not adequately secured. In multi-hop QKD networks, where nodes cannot be fully trusted, providing an unconditional security guarantee becomes infeasible. Our recent study acknowledges that all network nodes are susceptible to potential attacks by eavesdroppers. We partially trust the nodes and represent their vulnerability by associating a compromise probability to them. An oblivious eavesdropper tries to gain access to the network nodes in an independent and identical manner. Even in this simple setting, the literature lacks throughput-optimal routing policies that can guarantee some form of security.\r\n\r\nWe propose an online dynamic policy, Tandem Queue Decomposition Plus (TQD+), that offers maximum security guarantees during routing while simultaneously maintaining stable network queues. The key idea is to translate the notion of safety to link weights of the network, which is then jointly minimized along with the Lyapunov drift. Using techniques from the stochastic Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty framework, we establish the bounded average queue occupancy and optimal security achievability. The theoretical results are supported with extensive simulations conducted on a comprehensive network simulator, TQD+SimModule, built on top of OMNeT++, and the simulator is made publicly available.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/pct-vwdt-jd','','',1,'2024-08-05 03:29:46','Active'),(1034,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Astronomical Algorithms in the Tithinirá¹‡aya and Dá¹›ggaá¹‡ita','MR.

Yet, comprehending how combinations of these variants collectively impact complex traits remains a pivotal question in quantitative genetics. To address this, we utilise the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, well known for its effectiveness in elucidating intricate biological processes. Using a publicly available single timepoint RNA-Seq dataset of a panel of allele replacement strains consisting of four causal SNPs, we employed genome-scale metabolic modelling to develop SNP-specific metabolic models for all combinations of causal SNPs affecting yeast sporulation efficiency. Differential flux analysis across these models revealed distinct metabolic reactions activated in various pathways, accounting for the observed differences in sporulation efficiency. Notably, differential regulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and autophagy in certain SNP combinations indicated autophagy as a compensatory mechanism to enhance sporulation efficiency.\r\n\r\nDespite these findings, the complex interactions between genetic variations, protein allocation, and intracellular flux over time remain underexplored. To address this, we generated time-resolved transcriptomic and proteomic profiles for two individual SNPs (MKT1(89G) and TAO3(4477C)) and their combination during sporulation. Temporal RNA-seq analysis and gene expression trajectory clustering revealed an early wave of amino acid biosynthesis regulated by SNP combinations, underscoring their distinct regulatory effects. Additionally, our absolute proteome dataset for strains with single and double SNPs identified the activation of the arginine biosynthetic pathway in response to SNP combinations. Further validation using arginine pathway deletion mutants highlighted the unique role of the ARG4 gene in maintaining mitochondrial activity when SNPs are combined. This comprehensive study underscores how genetic polymorphisms interact to modulate metabolic pathways in yeast, offering valuable insights into the genetic basis of complex traits and the role of GWAS variants in metabolic diseases.\r\n\r\nMy research presents empirical mechanisms of SNP interactions differentially affecting phenotype through variations in gene expression, protein allocation and intracellular metabolic fluxes.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-05 07:06:28','Active'),(1037,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','\"R&D and Entrepreneurship Opportunities in Renewable Energy and Sustainability, experience sharing\"','Professor Dr. Ajay Chandak, a renowned innovator, researcher, and consultant in renewable energy and sustainability.','Dr. Chandak, holding a Ph.D. in Solar/Mechanical Engineering and an M.Tech from IIT Bombay, is also a \"Certified Energy Auditor\" and \"Chartered Mechanical Engineer.\" With over three decades of academic experience and a focus on innovations and sustainability, he has established India\'s probably only privately owned and operated R&D unit in Dhule.

Improper management of crowds results in disasters like stampede or crush. A few stampedes that happened in the past three decades are the Vaishno temple stampede (2022) in Katra at Jammu, which resulted in 12 fatalities; the South Korea Seoul stampede (2022) had 159 deaths; the Kumbh (2014) at U.P. in India fatalities of 36, Hajj (1994) at Saudi Arabia was one of the biggest tragedies that resulted in 270 deaths. Thus, intense research is needed to tackle the problem of crowd management. Modelling crowd flow helps understand crowd motion dynamics in complex systems. Controlling various parameters such as system geometry and crowd characteristics allows one to relate a realistic crowd movement scenario in modelling the crowd motion. The dynamics of human crowds are studied using agent-based modelling and the proposition that the random motion of agents can be transitioned to collective motion by controlling individual agent dynamics. Specifically, it is investigated and characterised the nature of transitions from collective motion to disorderly motion and vice versa. The results show that collective motion in crowds arises under specific coordination and individual motivation conditions. A regime map is shown when the first-order phase transition from disordered to orderly crowd motion is observed as the coordination increases. Similarly, a second-order transition is observed for a constant coordination coefficient as the individual motivation increases. Therefore, for every value of the coordination coefficient, a critical value of motive force is identified, which is required for the crowd to self-organize by smoothly transitioning into orderly motion. With the help of agent-based modelling, crowd transition has been investigated for confined geometry by identifying the range of parameters that describe the stampede regime. However, the range of parameters may be different for the open geometries. Therefore, modelling crowd motion in open geometries such as straight corridors with unidirectional and bidirectional crowd motion helps to understand the dynamics of pedestrian movements in train stations.\r\n\r\nContinuous urbanisation demands sophisticated infrastructures such as bus stations, railway stations and airports. The number of commuters is increasing every year, and these numbers will go higher in the coming decades. Hence, the management of high-density crowds is a crucial and outstanding societal issue, attracting substantial multidisciplinary research. A common crowd management option in such situations relies on field stewards and policemen indicating verbally or visually a preferred walking way. Yet, the qualitative/quantitative extent to which these indications effectively steer flows across different density levels remains unclear. This study investigates a prototypical management issue in real-life conditions: a large crowd of commuters in high-density conditions must be nudged to pass an obstacle by a preferred side. Considered here the nudging efficacy of four types of stimuli (indications delivered by a police officer, by a steward in a reflecting jacket, by signage, and by an aid cone) and compare them qualitatively-quantitatively with the baseline flow (no crowd control) in the hall of one of the busiest train stations of Chennai city, India (100K+ passengers/day), by collecting video images of the alighting pedestrians during different mornings. Passenger tracking and trajectory calculation are performed via deep learning-based localization and optical flow. The current findings revealed a considerable response of the crowd to the stimulus. Interventions helped the alighting process of the pedestrians from the station waiting hall, as shown in the plots qualitatively and quantitatively. The interesting outcome of the study is that crowd management is effective if the stimulus is active (police/field steward) instead of a passive (signage/aid cone) stimulus placed in the waiting hall. In other words, the presence of police/field stewards helps to control the crowd movement in a large station area effectively. This work (for the first time) quantitatively estimates the crowd evacuation under different interventions, {and the role of stimulus to the alighting pedestrians from the train station is investigated to improve crowd management efficacy.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle link : https://meet.google.com/yyb-jgtg-nez','','',1,'2024-08-05 07:18:04','Active'),(1039,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','A reliable Fast Frequency Hopping Technique for OFDM and associated Link Synchronization at the Receiver.','Mr.  R Vignesh (EE18S070)','MS Scholar','Guide: Dr. K Giridhar','Electrical Engineering','2024/08/06 15:00','2024-08-06','yes','Online','Frequency Hopping (FH) is an effective way to ensure resilience to jamming and eavesdropping. Combined with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms, they provide some characteristics vital to the communication links in the strategic/defence space. We consider a baseband-based ultra-fast FH system where a contiguous set of subcarriers of an OFDM block which hold data are altered periodically based on a random code pattern. We elicit the advantages and drawbacks of this implementation against other FH schemes in baseband and passband including the conventional RF-carrier hopping. Since only a small set of subcarriers of the OFDM symbol are used in any one hop, receiver synchronization for timing and frequency is difficult since the time-domain auto-correlation properties degrade. Time-domain cross-correlation may not be a viable synchronization technique since the receiver cannot possibly know the current hop in case of a cold-start or a warm-start. \r\n\r\nIn this work, for such a scenario, we compare existing preamble structures and processing methods using autocorrelation for synchronization. We then propose a new preamble with a two-step improved timing estimate.

Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed preamble and processing scheme, especially at low Signal-to-Noise Ratios.

To reduce its dependence on imported oil, India plans to decrease its net crude oil import to 67% by increasing local exploration and investing in renewable energy sources. However, at present, renewable energy is unable to fulfill the country\'s energy requirements. Oil and gas play a vital role in fulfilling energy demands.

Thus, the oil and gas production companies concentrate on exploiting oil till reach the maximum productivity. The primary and secondary recovery techniques recover only about 40-50% of the original oil in place (OOIP). Even after primary and secondary oil recovery, about 50-60% of the oil remains trapped in the reservoir. In order to recover a part of this trapped oil, tertiary (or) enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques are used. Low salinity water (LSW) flooding is one of the emerging EOR techniques because of its low cost, seawater availability, and environmentally friendly nature. LSW could not significantly reduce the interfacial tension (IFT) of oil-water systems to the desired level. Thus, adding additives that increase the oil recovery and opens to a new area of research. IFT and wettability are the two major factors influencing oil recovery. The synergistic effect of LSW with chemical agents such as surfactants, alkalis, nanoparticle and polymer is an emerging technology for EOR. Recently, the use of nanoparticle for EOR has become the attractive option. This study examines the impact of LSW-surfactant-silica nanofluid on IFT and wettability alteration in an oil-water-quartz system using various types of oils. Besides, the adsorption of surfactant on the rock surface in the presence of silica nanoparticles is also studied. Further, this study explored the silica nanoparticle as a potential agent for oil recovery. We observed that the nanofluid produced by the synergistic effect of silica nanoparticles and surfactant in LSW could effectively reduce IFT, wettability altered toward water-wet and reduce the surfactant adsorption on rock surface and increases the oil recovery to 29%.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-05 11:34:51','Active'),(1042,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF ADDITIVES IN LOW SALINITY WATER FOR ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY OF CRUDE OIL.','MR.

In order to recover a part of this trapped oil, tertiary (or) enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques are used. Low salinity water (LSW) flooding is one of the emerging EOR techniques because of its low cost, seawater availability, and environmentally friendly nature. LSW could not significantly reduce the interfacial tension (IFT) of oil-water systems to the desired level. Thus, adding additives that increase the oil recovery and opens to a new area of research. IFT and wettability are the two major factors influencing oil recovery. The synergistic effect of LSW with chemical agents such as surfactants, alkalis, nanoparticle and polymer is an emerging technology for EOR. Recently, the use of nanoparticle for EOR has become the attractive option. This study examines the impact of LSW-surfactant-silica nanofluid on IFT and wettability alteration in an oil-water-quartz system using various types of oils. Besides, the adsorption of surfactant on the rock surface in the presence of silica nanoparticles is also studied. Further, this study explored the silica nanoparticle as a potential agent for oil recovery. We observed that the nanofluid produced by the synergistic effect of silica nanoparticles and surfactant in LSW could effectively reduce IFT, wettability altered toward water-wet and reduce the surfactant adsorption on rock surface and increases the oil recovery to 29%.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-06 03:06:45','Active'),(1043,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Flare Removal ','Mr. Matta Gopi Raju (EE17D021)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Kaushik Mitra','Department of Electrical Engineering','2024/08/07 15:00','2024-08-07','yes','ESB 244','Flare, an optical phenomenon caused by unwanted scattering and reflections of light rays within a lens system, poses a significant challenge in imaging. Flares appear in diverse patterns (halos, streaks, color bleeding, haze, etc.), which makes flare removal challenging. Existing traditional and learning-based methods have exhibited limited efficacy due to their reliance on single-image approaches, where flare removal is highly ill-posed. Viewing flare removal as a multi-view image problem can enable the power to harness information from neighboring views, leveraging the fact that flare is view(direction) dependent. This underscores the notion that information that is lost by flare in one view can be extracted from alternate views. Building upon this concept, we propose GN-FR: Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Flare Removal, which can render flare-free novel views from a sparse set of input views that are corrupted by lens flare, and can also generalizes across scenes in an unsupervised setup. GN-FR includes the following modules: FMG (Flare-occupancy Mask Generation), VS (View sampler) , PS (Point sampler) embedded into the GNT framework. As capturing data both with and without flare is highly impractical, we propose a Masking loss function that incorporates mask information in an unsupervised fashion. We also contribute the first-of-its-kind 3D(multi-view) flare dataset, which contains 17 real flare scenes and also Flare pattern dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that does flare removal in a NeRF setup. At the end, we also present our Novel View Synthesis(NVS) framework towards flare removal using 3D Gaussian Splatting(3DGS) technique.

The forward-kinematic or gain-type singularities inside the workspace further restrict the usable or safe workspace. Additionally, the complexity of the dynamic modelling techniques and the stabilisation of the numerical methods used make real-time simulation of the dynamics of the PMs a challenge. Considering all of the above, this work focuses on developing computationally efficient algorithms enabling real-time singularity-free path planning and safe operation of PMs. The scope of this research is limited to fully actuated 6-degrees of freedom (DoF) rigid-link PMs such as the Semi-regular Stewart platform manipulator (SRSPM) and the 6-RSS PM, and the significant contributions are summarised below.\r\nA numerically efficient dynamic simulation method using an extended-configuration-space model is presented. It is not only fast, i.e., it may perform simulations at a frequency of â‰ˆ50Hz, but is also accurate. Such fast and accurate dynamic models are crucial for designing nonlinear controllers, especially for high-frequency applications and developing real-time model predictive controllers. This model would also aid in the design of the PMs with dynamic considerations.\r\nAn analytical parametric description of the Singularity-free tube (SFT) as a singularity-free volume in the constant-orientation workspace of SRSPM is introduced. A new computationally efficient methodology for computing the SFT for the SRSPM is presented. As a result, the SFT may be obtained at a frequency of â‰ˆ10Hz, thus enabling constant-orientation singularity-free path planning. The concept of the SFT may be extended to the class of PMs for which the gain-type singularities are\r\nknown analytically.\r\nA novel Safe workspace exploration algorithm (SWEA) is proposed, which ensures safe operation without having the explicit knowledge of the gain-type singularity analytically. SWEA may also be extended to other PMs and multibody systems with closed-loop kinematic chains since it only relies on the kinematics of the PMs. The SWEA acts as an input filter and may be coupled with a high-level controller without additional computational overhead. The SWEA is coupled with a trajectory-tracking controller and can successfully stop the PM from entering a singular configuration. The SWEA is shown to allow increased utilisation of the workspace of the 6-RSS and succeeds in ensuring the safe operation of the PM. Desktop prototypes of both the SRSPM and the 6-RSS are also developed as a part of the research. These prototypes aid in highlighting the challenges, demonstrating the effect of gain-type singularities, and validating the developed algorithms. The safe operation using SWEA is also demonstrated experimentally using joystick inputs for the 6-RSS.','EDOffice','edoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-06 04:09:40','Active'),(1045,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Design and Development of Steam Quality Measurement using Optical Techniques ','Mr.Manish Chandra (AM17D300)','Ph.D. research scholar, Dept. of Applied Mechanics & Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras','Guide(s) - Dr. Satyanarayanan Seshadri & Dr. Nilesh Jayantilal Vasa','Department of Applied Mechanics & Biomedical Engineering','2024/08/13 15:00','2024-08-13','yes','https://meet.google.com/zff-qaii-sxo','Steam is essential in industrial heat transfer, particularly in power plants where it drives turbines for electricity generation. However, moisture accumulation in steam reduces efficiency, causing scaling, erosion, water hammer, and premature system failures. Accurate detection of steam dryness is critical for maintaining efficiency in steam-based operations. Traditional methods for detecting dryness, such as separating and throttling calorimeters, are impractical for frequent reporting due to lengthy thermal stability requirements. Online methods like absorption and scattering spectroscopy offer higher accuracy but face interference from other species and varying operating conditions.\r\nWe propose a novel dual-wavelength absorption technique (DWAT) to measure and validate the steam dryness fraction of wet steam. This technique uses a thermally insulated steam cell with a temperature-controlled window (up to 200Â°C) to minimize condensation during measurements at pressures ranging from 1 to 10 bars. DWAT significantly improves measurement accuracy by employing a non-dimensional correction factor to account for pressure and temperature effects on water vapor absorbance. Steam dryness is determined by the concentration of water vapor and the total mass of wet steam in the cell. Validation using a four-stage separating and throttling calorimeter combined with a condensation rig achieved Â±1% accuracy across various dryness levels and operating pressures. Tunable diode laser (TDL)-based systems face accuracy limitations at high pressures (>60 bars) due to pressure broadening. To address this, we designed a throttler orifice to reduce steam pressure from 60 to 15 bars and then from 15 to 3 bars, integrating the optical technique for dryness measurement. Experiments were conducted at pressures up to 15 bars due to steam generation constraints.\r\nTo further enhance accuracy, we introduced a wavelet transform-based approach, selecting gases (SOx and NOx) with broadband absorption characteristics for validation. The experimental setup utilized a broadband UV lamp and wavelet decomposition to extract frequency-localized absorption information. This method, providing both frequency and time localization, successfully differentiated individual gas molecules without interference from other species. Ongoing studies aim to refine this technique for broader pressure ranges, offering a promising solution for improving efficiency in steam-dependent processes.\r\n','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/zff-qaii-sxo','','',1,'2024-08-06 04:42:07','Active'),(1046,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- முதலுதவி (mudhaludhavi) \r\nHindi word	- प्राथमिक चिकित्सा  ( praathamik chikitsaa) \r\nEnglish word	- first aid ','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-08-06 04:42:24','default_value'),(1047,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Study of Glass Resistive Plate Chamber, Low Gain Avalanche Detector and Lepton Flavour Universality Test in Top Quarks Pair Events at CMS','Mr. ANUP KUMAR SIKDAR, (PH16D055)','PhD Scholar','Guide: Dr. PRAFULLA KUMAR BEHERA','Department of Physics','2024/08/08 16:00','2024-08-08','yes','ONLINE','Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) are used in various fields of particle physics for their high precision, longevity, and low-cost nature.

The electrodes are typically made of: Nickel/Carbon or Raney Nickel as cathode and Ni/Co/Fe or itsâ€™ alloys as anode. AWEâ€™s non-requirement of precious metals as catalysts but still delivering efficiency (59â€“70 %), makes it the most popular industrial water electrolyzer [3]. However, there are still a lot of challenges to address including optimization of electrocatalysts with Ni,Fe and Co, prevention of hydride formation and hydrogen embrittlement in Ni cathode etc [4].\r\n\r\nThe current work aims at addressing these two challenges via (i) data-driven approach of optimizing transiton-metal based electrocatalysts, (ii) electrolyte design approach by optimizing the Fe impurities and investigating the role of these impurities on Ni cathodes and (iii) electrocatalyst enhancement approach probed with in-situ operando spectroscopy. With the data-driven approach, we could report for the first time that rules for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are porous Ni or Fe-based composites, with combinatorial structures or thin films and average d-electrons â‰¥ 5. From literature, it is clear that Fe does not have to be ex-situ doped into Ni-based electrocatalyst while synthesis but can happen by Fe pick-up from the electrolyte during water-splitting [5]. For the electrolyte design approach, the following work will be carried out to understand the exact role of Fe impurities on the cathode with respect to hydride forming capabilitites: i) systematic addition of Fe impurities to study the effect of these impurities on Ni cathode activity ii) probing and correlating electrochemistry with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and micro-X-Ray Fluorescence. The final approach - electrocatalyst enhancement approach, will be discuused with respect to a 10-fold increase in cathode activity by nano-compositing of the Ni(OH)2 with Pt nanoparticles.

Key bacterial strains, such as Magnetospirillum and Shewanella species, are known for their ability to produce MNPs with controlled size and shape [1].

We focus on Arithmetic Word Problems (AWPs), which have significant applicability in the field of education. Various approaches have been proposed to address their automatic solving, generation, and validity checking, with AWP-solving being the most widely explored. We believe that current techniques for addressing these challenges are under-utilizing the relevant domain knowledge. Ontology is a widely used knowledge representation framework. We study Transfer-Case Arithmetic Word Problems (TC-AWPs or TC word problems). TC-AWPs are those word problems where object transfers happen among agents. We encode domain knowledge by developing an ontology (namely TC Ontology) and demonstrate its effectiveness in our proposed works.\r\n\r\n    To begin with, we propose a knowledge and learning-based system to solve simple TC word problems (involving single object-transfer). The learning component is a statistical classifier that recognizes the types of sentences in word problems. We represent the knowledge about TC-AWPs as TC-ontology. The relevant information extracted from word problem text is represented as an RDF graph by utilizing the TC Ontology terminology. To solve the given word problem, we develop and utilize semantic web rule language (SWRL) rules that capture the knowledge about how object-transfer affects the RDF graph of the word problem. Using the TC Ontology, we also analyze if the given problem is mathematically-valid or otherwise.\r\n\r\n    Next, we propose a system to post-process (i.e. validity checking and repairing) the machine-generated TC word problems. Generating AWPs is challenging, as it requires generating logically valid text. We leverage Deep Learning models for word problem generation. Even though we train these models on valid TC-AWPs, they generate word problem texts of three kinds: valid, invalid, and near-valid (grammatically correct but mathematically incorrect). Therefore, we propose an ontology-based system to check the validity of the machine-generated examples. As a bonus, we also show the effectiveness of the domain knowledge in identifying the near-valid cases and in making them valid. \r\n\r\n    Lastly, we focus on generating and solving complex TC-AWPs (problems that involve more than one object transfer). Since the Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on large natural language texts, they could solve most of the simple TC-AWPs. In this work, we focus on assessing the capability of LLMs (chatGPT and Gemini) in solving complex TC-AWPs. Since the popular AWP datasets contain only simple TC-AWPs, we first generate complex TC-AWPs using an ontological approach. We then utilize these complex examples to assess LLMs\' word-problem-solving capabilities. We find that LLMs find it hard to solve complex TC-AWPs. The proposed approach is more effective in solving complex TC-AWPs as it exploits domain knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n','CS Office','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-06 11:11:37','Active'),(1051,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL',' Second Born Electrons and Rescue at Sea','Prof. A Ravi P Rau','Prof. Ravi Rau obtained his BSc (Hons) and MSc in Physics from Delhi University.

The recombinant ï¢-D-1,4-endoxylanase (XynC) of Bacillus subtilis KCX006 was purified using the affinity tag through Ni-NTA columns. Subsequently, they were employed in catalysis of BWX (beechwood xylan) for XOS production. The purified recombinant xylanase was immobilized on various silica carriers, including amorphous silica nanoparticles (silicic acid and fumed silica) and crystalline mesoporous ordered structures (IITM-41, MCM-41, SBA-15). Additionally, silica materials functionalized with basic (amine, -NH2) and acidic (sulfonic acid, -SO3H) groups, as well as aluminosilicates, were tested for immobilization of xylanase. Amorphous materials exhibited a high immobilization yield (IY) of over 90%, while the mesoporous material IITM-41 showed a maximum recovered activity (RA) of 74%. All the immobilized xylanases showed no shift in the optimum pH except those bound on functionalized SBA-15. The optimal pH of xylanase bound on SBA-15-NH2 decreased to 5.0 from 6.6. In contrast, the optimum pH of xylanase immobilized on SBA-15-SO3H increased to 8.0 from 6.6. Immobilization improved the xylanase\'s temperature tolerance by 10Â°C, leading to optimal performance at higher temperatures. The Km values of immobilized xylanases were higher due to the substrate diffusion limitation. But the Vmax of the immobilized xylanases were also higher indicating improved performance. Xylanases immobilized on Al-MCM-41 and IITM-41 produced maximum total XOS of 812.67 mg/g and 797.61 mg/g, respectively. Immobilized xylanases were recycled for 10 batches retaining 80% of the original XOS yield. The adsorption kinetics, the adsorption isotherm models, and the thermodynamic parameters indicated favorable and spontaneous adsorption of xylanase on the tested matrices. Furthermore, after storing for 30 days, bound enzymes maintained significantly higher activity compared to the free enzyme. These observations demonstrated efficient recycling of xylanase by immobilization on mesoporous silica matrices for XOS production.','BT OFFICE','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','Publications: 1.J.P.M, Kartik, P.

Consequently, the need for highly efficient RF power amplifiers (PAs) that can be effectively linearized becomes paramount. GaN based power amplifiers provide better efficiency, gain, and thermal performance when compared to alternate semiconductor technologies.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary challenges faced in optimizing RF power amplifiers is the inherent static non-linearity that arises from intermodulation distortion, giving rise to spectral regrowth in bands adjacent to the modulated signal. Another challenge in power amplifier design is memory effects (dynamic non-linearity) caused by time variations in their transfer characteristics, wherein the output signal depends not only on the current input sample but also on the past input. Memory effects mainly arise from trapping and de-trapping phenomena and self-heating in GaN HEMT.\r\n\r\nAchieving an optimal balance in key power amplifier specifications, like linearity, output power, and power added efficiency, is a challenging task due to their complex trade-offs. Due to the presence of non-linearity in PA, accurate compact modeling is critical for the design, optimization, and linearization of power amplifiers. Standard compact models of GaN HEMT fail to adequately capture effects such as charge carrier trapping and self-heating. This research delves into the intricate dynamics of GaN HEMT RF power amplifiers, with a specific focus on memory effects and non-linearity. The goal of this research work is to develop a physics-based compact model of GaN HEMT that captures the non-linearity and memory effects.

The sphere is used as a case study for the flow past the bluff body. The present work aims to experimentally study the separation line over the surface of the sphere for different Reynolds numbers, Re=0.27-1.2 *10^5. Oil flow visualization is used to determine the location of the separation line along with the wall pressure measurement over the surface of the sphere for the same set of Reynolds numbers. The results from the oil flow are processed to obtain the equation and location for the separation line over the surface of the sphere. Pressure measurements indicate that the roughness of the sphere causes a change in flow pattern at Re=1.0*10^5, and a similar trend is observed in the case of results from oil flow visualization. Computational analysis of spheres with different roughness is studied to identify the change in separation line, drag coefficient and shear stress patterns. The results indicate a stark difference in patterns of shear stress and the wake structure for spheres with different roughness.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the study focuses on streamlined bodies. NACA 4415 wing is taken as a case to understand the structure of separation lines, the effect of Re and Angle of Attack (AOA) and the mechanism of stall. The results indicate that the effect of Re is more dominant in influencing the movement of local flow separation compared to the angle of attack. The present work also has compared the effect of symmetry and thickness on the mechanism of stall and local flow separation.

In extreme environments in the interstellar medium (i.e., 10-30 K and 10-10 mbar pressure), the mechanism behind the physical and chemical transformation of molecules stands as a pertinent question.1 Water ice, the most ubiquitous molecule in interstellar space, significantly influences phase transitions, crystallization, solvation, and diffusion of radicals and other intermediate species in mixed ices. This, in turn, affects the physical transformations and chemical reactivities of molecular solids in space.2,3 Clathrate hydrates are a class of host-guest inclusion compounds that exist as a solid phase of water in the interstellar mixed ices.4 These structures form when water molecules create a hydrogen-bonded network that traps small molecules, leading to the formation of clathrate hydrates. Molecular ices exposed to cosmic radiation produce radicals, carbenes, ions, and transient species, which convert into irradiated photoproducts and reside in a mixed ice enriched with water ice, creating a solid molecular soup.5 In this context, my research proposal aims to explore the physical insights in the formation of single and binary clathrate hydrates from interstellar ice analogs. The photochemical reactions in the clathrate cage will be investigated. The reaction mechanism of photo-irradiated molecular solids inside and outside clathrate hydrate entrapment will be elucidated. In our recent work, the effect of the ice composition in the formation of structure I and II clathrate hydrate of trimethylene oxide is studied. Additionally, the dissociation-induced crystallization of amorphous water ice is compared.\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] 	Herbst, E.

Employees in NPOs play a substantial role in delivering human services. While NPOs heavily depend on employees to achieve their objectives, concerns persist about the significant challenge of voluntary employee turnover. Recent data indicates that 86% of NPOs struggle with retaining their employees. This issue is more concerning because nearly 45% of nonprofit employees are expected to seek new career opportunities by 2025. Therefore, it is crucial for the NPOs to identify factors associated with employee turnover to retain the employees.\r\n\r\nBased on this, the study aims to explore the factors influencing voluntary employee turnover in Indian NPOs. To achieve its aim, the study is proposed to be conducted in three phases. The first phase begins with a comprehensive literature review of factors influencing voluntary employee turnover in NPOs to understand the phenomenon. The literature review process enabled the identification of critical constructs and led to Study 1 (second phase). Study 1 will employ a qualitative approach to gather in-depth insights through semi-structured interviews with NPO employees and employers. Based on the results of Study 1, a research framework will be developed for Study 2, and a survey will be conducted to collect quantitative data from employees in NPOs.\r\n\r\nThe study aims to fill a research gap in the Indian context by analysing factors influencing voluntary employee turnover in NPOs. By identifying key turnover factors, the study will help NPO leaders develop effective retention strategies, enhance overall organisational performance, and reduce costs related to recruitment, training, and lost productivity. The findings will provide actionable insights and practical recommendations to improve the recruitment process and employee job satisfaction, enriching the field of human resource management.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','RESEARCH PROPOSAL SEMINAR-web confernce link-','','',1,'2024-08-08 06:19:28','Active'),(1064,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Joint Association and Localization of Multiple Targets in an OTFS-Based Multistatic ISAC System','Ms. Sruti S (EE18D705)','Ph.D scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Giridhar K','Electrical Engineering','2024/08/13 11:00','2024-08-13','yes','ESB 244/Googlemeet','Orthogonal Time Frequency and Space (OTFS) modulation-based system for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) in vehicular scenarios is a promising technology and is expected to provide reliable communication in high-speed environments. A Vehicle-to-Infrastructure-based OTFS multistatic system with single and multiple transmitters is proposed in this work. The cell towers communicate to the intended target vehicle(s) and simultaneously estimate the location, velocity, and bistatic radar cross-section of other targets in the scene. Bringing in a multistatic framework gives the advantage of exploiting spatial diversity for better target detection. Pilot sequences are chosen to ensure both spectral efficiency and accurate detection and parameter estimation by using the signals from multiple transmitters. However, in the case of multiple targets, associating measurements to targets is critical in multistatic systems. The prime problem of multi-target data association is solved by a joint association and localization approach using the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit framework. Simulations are performed with real-time system and signal parameters. Performance of the algorithm for various OTFS Delay-Doppler block-size configurations and multiple targets of different bistatic radar cross-sections is demonstrated. The performance and complexity comparison with other existing data association approaches are furnished. The results highlight better accuracy with lesser complexity, thus aiding in the practical implementation of an ISAC system. Furthermore, the extension of our algorithm to accommodate fractional bistatic delay and Doppler measurements is also described so that enhanced performance can be achieved with lesser bandwidth requirements.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/ies-wprz-byb','','',1,'2024-08-08 06:22:20','Active'),(1065,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Effect of Frictional Characteristics on Size Segregation in Granular Flow','   Mr. Ongchuk Namgyal Lepcha , Roll No CE21D060','Ph.D Scholar','Dr. Vidya Bhushan Maji - Guide, Dr. Robinson R G - Co-Guide, Dr. Piyush Chaunsali - DC Member, Dr.Ramesh Kannan K - DC Member,  Dr. Abhijit Chaudhuri (AM) - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head ','Civil Engineering','2024/08/14 14:00','2024-08-14','yes','BSB 104, Conference Room','Particle size segregation occurs when granular materials of different sizes are subjected to\r\nshear or vibration.

In this equation, localized gender norms and informal networks are recognized across global settings as critical factors shaping the patterns of womenâ€™s political engagement. South Asian and Indian contexts are known for producing exceptionally successful female political leaders, in spite of the highly unfavorable conditions engendered by their patriarchal socio-religious fabric. On the other hand, Kerala, the southernmost state in India, stood out for both its remarkably propitious socio-political environment for womenâ€™s entry into public politics as well as the massive participation of women in governance spaces subsequent to decentralization in the 1990s. On closer examination, however, the state\'s political landscape is also strongly underwritten by gendered norms and informalities influencing women\'s entry into politics and survival in political offices. Following the right-wing turn in national politics, the state is experiencing extensive mobilization by right-wing groups, with significant involvement from women across local and state levels. In addition, the ongoing capital penetration in the state manifested in the infrastructural imaginations and huge financial outlays of local bodies have implications for womenâ€™s political engagement as well as the existing rural-urban divide in local governance. \r\nThis backdrop makes it imperative to take a closer look at the shifts and transitions women have experienced over the years in terms of their political participation at grassroots and state levels, how the right-wing mobilizations are taking hold among grassroots activists, and womenâ€™s responses to these changes. In my doctoral research, I aim to qualitatively differentiate subnational/state and local levels of politics, emphasizing the distinct demands these spaces place on women in terms of skills, rhetoric and activism. Further, the research attempts to map the continuities and discontinuities in womenâ€™s political engagement in rural local bodies across religious/caste groups and political parties by critically reviewing the existing scholarship. It also seeks to comprehensively analyze the patterns/models of womenâ€™s political activism at the state level across party affiliations, focusing on the recent political shifts. The emergent right-wing politics and its channels of mobilization of women and the local-specific gender norms and informal networks are cross-cutting themes of this doctoral work. The study employs qualitative research methods, including open-ended, individual interviews, textual analysis and focus group discussions, to gather insights from the field and build on the existing scholarship on women\'s political participation. \r\n','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/zzp-weho-sdg','','',1,'2024-08-09 04:28:40','Active'),(1072,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\" Enhancing the thermoelectric properties of copper based materials(copper selenide, copper iodide) via doping strategy \".','T V VENKATA RAMANA (MM17D408)','Ph.D Scholar, Dept of MME.','Guide: Ravi Kumar N V , MME.\r\nCo - Guide: Dillip Kumar Satapathy  , Physics.','Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering','2024/08/13 16:00','2024-08-13','yes','Seminar Hall (NAC 222), MME Department, KCB.','Worldwide energy needs urges the scientific community to develop efficient renewable energy conversion processes. On the other hand, a lot of available primary energy resources are getting wasted in the form of heat. There is a lot of scope in utilizing this heat by converting it into a useful form of energy. In this regard thermoelectric devices play a crucial role due to their ability to directly convert heat gradient into voltage or vice versa. To improve the efficiency of a thermoelectric device, it requires a high thermal gradient and a high figure of merit of a material. Figure of merit is a dimensionless quantity, which depends on material properties such as Seebeck coefficient,  electrical conductivity and thermal conductivities. A good thermoelectric material should possess high electrical conductivity like metals, low thermal conductivity like ceramics and good Seebeck coefficient like semiconductors, all the distinct properties together in a single material.\r\n\r\nCopper based inorganic materials(copper selenide and copper iodide) were chosen for this study due to their intrinsically very low thermal conductivity. This work aims to improve the electrical properties of these materials via doping. As part of the first objective we investigated the effect of Aluminum doping on thermoelectric properties of copper iodide. Through optimum doping of Al(0.1 mol%) we achieved an improved figure of merit of  copper iodide (0.08 at 400 K) having the power factor of 79 micro W/m.K2 and thermal conductivity of 0.5 W/m.K. These results are corroborated with the increasing carrier density and decay mechanism of optical phonons. As part of the second objective we investigated the effect of Ni and Te doping on phase transition behavior and the thermoelectric properties of copper selenide. Both Ni and Te extended the window of phase transition temperature of copper selenide due to the requirement of high enthalpy of phase formation for doped systems. Ni and Te have shown distinct effects on thermoelectric properties of copper selenide. Doping Ni improved electrical conductivity whereas Te improved the Seebeck coefficient of copper selenide. Thus, through doping Ni and Te together we achieved an improved power factor of copper selenide (from 2 to 6 micro W/m.K2 at 350 K). The results are correlated with the evaluation of crystal structure and thermal analysis of the material. In conclusion, we establish doping as an effective strategy to improve thermoelectric properties of both copper based inorganic materials(copper iodide and copper selenide).','MME OFFICE 2','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-09 06:47:32','Active'),(1073,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','CAN THE OSCILLATIONS OF A SIMPLE PENDULUM EXPLAIN THE OSCILLATIONS OF A FLUID INTERFACE?','Dr. IGIN BENNY IGNATIUS','Igin earned his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Florida, where his research focused on theoretical and experimental fluid mechanics.

When a simple pendulum is vertically oscillated at a frequency near its natural frequency, it becomes unstable, resulting in violent oscillations due to resonance. Conversely, vertical oscillations stabilize an erstwhile unstable system, such as an inverted pendulum, by constraining it to its upright equilibrium position. Analogous to a simple pendulum, resonance in a fluid layer destabilizes the fluid layer, giving rise to violent undulations at the interface. Moreover, vertical oscillations stabilize an inherently unstable fluid system under opposing gravity, by confining this inverted fluid layer with a flat interface. \r\n These findings also extend to unstable systems on account of the Marangoni effect arising from imposed vertical temperature gradients. The study shows that at low forcing frequencies, the liquid film can be rendered stable with a flat free surface within a certain range of forcing amplitude. Outside this range, the fluid remains unstable, with Marangoni instability dominating at low forcing amplitudes and resonant instability at high forcing amplitudes. Suppressing these flows is important due to its relevance in coating industries for the manufacture of smooth optical films, and in additive manufacturing of metals in microgravity environments, which is crucial for human habitation in space.','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','EVENT HOST: Prof. S.

The field faces unique challenges that evolve with global shifts, highlighting the need for students and educators to navigate complex and sensitive issues effectively. In this context, resilience and cognitive flexibility are essential, enabling individuals to adapt and function well despite challenges. Drawing from positive psychology and with a primary intervention framework, exploring character strengths â€“ positive personality resourcesâ€”is a promising approach to enhancing well-being and optimal functioning in educational settings. An individualâ€™s mindset can influence how these resources are perceived, developed, and translated into cognitive-behavioural strategies.\r\nThis research, conducted in two separate studies on undergraduate students and pre-service teachers, used a multi and mixed method, multi-site design to a) understand the role of cognitive flexibility in resilience; b1)  test the effectiveness of a character strengths intervention on enhancing resilience and cognitive flexibility; b2) study the mediating role of cognitive flexibility in the relationship between the character strengths intervention and resilience, moderated by mindset; and c) explore participantsâ€™ perceptions of potential barriers to adherence to the intervention and the integration of learned techniques into various aspects of their lives.\r\nThe findings support the role of cognitive flexibility as an antecedent to resilience and demonstrate the interventionâ€™s impact on enhancing both. This research contributes to the resilience literature by operating within a cognitive-affective-behavioural framework and elucidating the pathways of the intervention. These insights help clarify the components of resilience and inform the development of measures and assessment criteria, aiding in understanding the determinants of this complex construct. Furthermore, the intervention aims to empower students and pre-service teachers to effectively utilise their internal resources in their personal and academic lives. The results of the studies will aid in developing focused interventions that can be easily incorporated into current educational programs and initiatives, promoting and preparing a resilient future workforce. \r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','SEMINAR - II (RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM)-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-09 11:25:14','Active'),(1075,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Modelling, Design and Control for High Voltage Resonant-based Pulse Power Supplies','Mr. Chinara Kuldip (EE19D413)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. Lakshminarasamma ','Electrical Engineering','2024/08/19 15:00','2024-08-19','yes','ESB 234 (Malaviya Hall)','Usage of ozone is an effective way of treating wastewater, and the silent discharge technique is one of the most efficient and reliable methods for ozone production. Ozone is generated in a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) chamber through the silent discharge technique and is powered by a high voltage (in the range of -2.5 kV to -5 kV) pulse generator. The pulse generator has two conversion stages, i.e., a high-frequency pre-processing stage and a pulse-frequency post-processing stage. In a high voltage pulse generator, a significant amount of energy from the input is utilised by the converter\'s parasitic capacitance and leakage inductance, which reduces the energy delivered to the load for each pulse cycle. This paper proposes an energy-based analysis exploring the potential usage of the flyback converter-based high voltage pulse generator for an application with power requirements under 150W, and water treatment is such an application. An energy-based approach is appropriate to describe the behaviour of the pulse generator in terms of circulating energy and energy exchanges in each stage and energy exchanges between the two stages (i.e. pre and post-processing stages). The proposed analysis is used to derive the essential parameters of the pulse generator and thereby arrive at an appropriate control scheme for the pre and post-processing stages. The proposed energy-based analysis and the derived analytical expressions of the high voltage pulse generator are verified experimentally for a pulsed output voltage of -5 kV having a Pulse Repetitive Rate (PRR) of 1000 Hz and pulse width of 15 us fed from a 12 V battery source.

In addition to providing our audience with an introduction to this art form, we will question recent theorizations of Carnatic music. Radical scholars have recently chastised Carnatic music for falsely claiming ancient heritage and reproducing caste and gender-related hierarchies.  From this perspective, they appear to have pulled the rug from beneath the conservatives.  Of course, Carnatic music as a â€œclassicalâ€ form only emerged in the modern period, largely to compete with the West and since the twentieth century, both the performers and the audience areprimarily upper cast.  However, we highlight aspects of music, especially the concept of raga, that cannot be subsumed under caste or simple concepts of modernity. There is theoretical and political potential of Carnatic music as raga music that we have not yet begun to explore.  We can catch a glimpse of this potential by examining practices such as improvisation.  We will illustrate our point by looking at the works and writings of actual musicians including the old stalwarts such as G.N. Balasubramaniam, along with female vocalists such as M.S. Subbalakshimi, Vidushi R. Vedavalli and T.M Krishna.  We aimto provide a way of looking at Carnatic music that enables us to rethink the dichotomy between the radicals and the conservatives in music and perhaps beyond.  \r\n\r\n \r\n','HSS OFFICE','hsoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-12 06:33:47','Active'),(1077,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Performance of Pulsating Heat Pipe Subjected to External Low-frequency Oscillations','Mr. Lakavath Sunil Naik (ME21S043) ','MS Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide Name: Prof. Shyama Prasad Das (ME) /\r\nGTC Members Names:  Prof. ASHIS KUMAR SEN-CHAIR PERSON (ME),\r\nProf. DHIMAN CHATTERJEE (ME), Prof. ABHIJIT CHAUDHURI (AM).\r\n','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/08/14 15:00','2024-08-14','yes','Through Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/nce-xjdr-fzk','Due to the high energy density and compactness of the electronic devices thermal management of the electronic components has been a challenging task in recent years. A pulsating heat pipe (PHP), which is a wickless and exploits the phase change phenomenon to transport large amount heat has been very promising. There are many applications which have inherent low/high frequency oscillations like ships, space shuttles, moving vehicles etc. The present study aims to experimentally investigate the effect of low-frequency oscillations on the performance of a pulsating heat pipe (PHP) in a laboratory scale. A seven-turn n-pentane PHP of 2mm internal diameter capillary tube with evaporator, adiabatic, and condenser sections (bottom heating mode) has been constructed to investigate its performance for 50%, 70%, and 85% filling ratios. The PHP is driven by a linear motor in a transverse direction for 1 mm and 3mm amplitude while operating in a frequency range of 0-3 Hz. Evaporator and condenser sections are supplied with constant temperature circulating fluid and by measuring its outlet temperature heat input/rejection is calculated. Evaporator temperature ranges from 45oC to 60oC for three condenser temperatures viz. 10oC, 15Â°C, and 20Â°C respectively. Investigation reveals the decrease of thermal resistance with heat input. It is also observed in the present case that thermal resistance increases marginally with increasing oscillation frequency but quite significantly with evaporator temperature. Furthermore, the heat input decreases with an increase in evaporator temperature. The best thermal performance has been observed at a 70% filling ratio with a thermal resistance of 0.081(Â°C/W) at 195 Watts.

The focus is on noncompact and slender-web, singly symmetric hybrid I-sections subjected to simultaneous high-moment and high-shear. This study is particularly pertinent to long-span bridge construction, where the use of higher-grade flanges (hybrid sections) and singly symmetric girders with smaller compression flanges is becoming more common to optimize both material use and cost. Despite such optimization, a significant cost of long-span bridges is associated with the fabrication of intermediate transverse stiffeners necessary for shear strength and cross-frames essential for the lateral stability of girders. Reducing the number of stiffeners or cross-frames, especially in regions of high-moment and high-shear, could result in combined shear buckling and lateral torsional buckling. While moment-shear interaction is typically considered in cross-section capacities, a few studies explore the efficacy of the compression flange in anchoring the post-buckling tension field-induced stresses with the advent of lateral torsional buckling. Experimental findings and numerical analyses results suggest that despite these conjoined instabilities, the current flexural and shear strength equations in the design codes are sufficiently conservative to warrant increasing the current allowances for unstiffened lengths for straight steel I-girders without any strength reduction.','R.

In this equation, localized gender norms and informal networks are recognized across global settings as critical factors shaping the patterns of womenâ€™s political engagement. South Asian and Indian contexts are known for producing exceptionally successful female political leaders, in spite of the highly unfavorable conditions engendered by their patriarchal socio-religious fabric. On the other hand, Kerala, the southernmost state in India, stood out for both its remarkably propitious socio-political environment for womenâ€™s entry into public politics as well as the massive participation of women in governance spaces subsequent to decentralization in the 1990s. On closer examination, however, the state\'s political landscape is also strongly underwritten by gendered norms and informalities influencing women\'s entry into politics and survival in political offices. Following the right-wing turn in national politics, the state is experiencing extensive mobilization by right-wing groups, with significant involvement from women across local and state levels. In addition, the ongoing capital penetration in the state manifested in the infrastructural imaginations and huge financial outlays of local bodies have implications for womenâ€™s political engagement as well as the existing rural-urban divide in local governance. \r\nThis backdrop makes it imperative to take a closer look at the shifts and transitions women have experienced over the years in terms of their political participation at grassroots and state levels, how the right-wing mobilizations are taking hold among grassroots activists, and womenâ€™s responses to these changes. In my doctoral research, I aim to qualitatively differentiate subnational/state and local levels of politics, emphasizing the distinct demands these spaces place on women in terms of skills, rhetoric and activism. Further, the research attempts to map the continuities and discontinuities in womenâ€™s political engagement in rural local bodies across religious/caste groups and political parties by critically reviewing the existing scholarship. It also seeks to comprehensively analyze the patterns/models of womenâ€™s political activism at the state level across party affiliations, focusing on the recent political shifts. The emergent right-wing politics and its channels of mobilization of women and the local-specific gender norms and informal networks are cross-cutting themes of this doctoral work. The study employs qualitative research methods, including open-ended, individual interviews, textual analysis and focus group discussions, to gather insights from the field and build on the existing scholarship on women\'s political participation. \r\n','HSS OFFICE','hsoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/zzp-weho-sdg','','',1,'2024-08-12 07:16:50','Active'),(1080,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Mode coupling and crosstalk analysis in few mode fibers.','Ms.  Priyanka Sharma (EE18S044)','MS Scholar','Guide: Dr. Deepa Venkitesh','Electrical Engineering','2024/08/16 11:30','2024-08-16','yes','Online','Growing demand for increased data capacity within optical fibers has prompted an investigation into spatial multiplexing strategies like few-mode and multi-core fiber-based transmissions. Specifically, the mode division multiplexing technique uses different spatial modes supported by the fiber as separate channels for data transmission, thereby increasing the spectral efficiency. Modes to be launched in fiber are generated using spatial light modulators (SLMs), while modal decomposition at the output of the few-mode fibers is performed using an optical correlation technique. We present how the SLM can be set up to generate the desired modes to be launched. These modes experience mixing in the fiber, and the redistribution of energy among the modes - specifically the amplitude and relative phases between them at the output- decide the complexity of the digital signal processing algorithms to demultiplex the output data. We also present how an optical correlation method can find the weights and relative phase between the modes of any given basis. Generation and decomposition of modes through SLM are carried out through numerical simulations and experiments. Once these modes propagate inside the fiber, linear coupling between them is a critical performance parameter that must be evaluated to understand their crosstalk. We provide a detailed computational model of this linear mode coupling and the associated crosstalk in a commercially available graded-index few-mode fiber (GI-FMF), considering disturbances from the manufacturing process and various stresses during and after deployment. Additionally, we compare LP and linearly polarized orbital angular momentum (LP-OAM) modes to determine which provides lesser crosstalk in FMFs. The simulation results in this study represent a significant advancement in the precision and complexity of models for signal transmission in few-mode fibers and can be extended to few-mode multicore fibers.

Many different three-dimensional models can predict the same uniaxial response. Further, in uniaxial experiments in plasticity, Poisonâ€™s ratio is not reported. Fort these reasons, there is uncertainty in the formulation of a three-dimensional constitutive relation. So, behaviour of metals in biaxial stress state should be studied to get a better understanding of the inelastic deformation of metals. The different experiments done to find the behaviour of metals in biaxial stress state are small punch test, hydraulic bulge test, cylinder inflation test, torsional test and direct biaxial test. Direct biaxial test specimen is free from the out of plane deformation as encountered in small punch test, hydraulic bulge test. Torsional and inflation test results in an inhomogeneous deformation and cylindrical inflation test presupposes the thin-walled assumption. Hence, an alternative setup wherein uniform biaxial state of stress can be achieved is required. Towards this, a comparative study on different specimen geometry for a direct fixed biaxial experiment is studied. Four cruciform shaped test specimens designed according to IS 800 and the standard ISO models for direct biaxial testing of materials Fe 250 is modelled using ABAQUS and biaxial stress states are simulated with appropriate boundary conditions.

The brine and condensate is carried to the last stage of the multi-effect desalination (MED) system by utilizing monometric head. It is observed that during the experimentation, the maximum temperature difference between inlet and outlet of the condenser cooling water is 13oC. The ejector is used to maintain the vacuum pressure during the operation of MED system including flash chamber. Experimental studies on the MED system is carried out to understand the performance as well as thermal behaviour of the system using exclusively solar energy. Based on the experimental system, a system-level simulation model is developed by modelling each component of the solar MED system. Thiruvananthapuram weather data is made to link with a flat plate model to get necessary weather data parameters, by employing TRNSYS - MATLAB live link plugin. This system-level model is then validated with the experimental system. Finally, a non-intrusive technique is developed to measure falling film thickness and temperature distribution simultaneously. By employing a high-speed camera and a high-speed infra-red camera, falling film thickness and film temperature are captured over both horizontal plain tubes and metal foamed tubes. After postâ€“processing the images, it is observed that using metal foam over a plain tube has a uniform temperature distribution, which in turn has a uniform film thickness. Also, a comparative heat transfer study is carried out on both plain and metal foam tubes to understand the scope of further enhancement in heat transfer. The heat transfer characteristic of a metal foamed tube is observed to be improved about 3 times higher than that of a plain tube.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/znq-wnax-moz','','',1,'2024-08-13 04:36:24','Active'),(1088,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Optimal signal Design for Multi-class and  Lane-free Traffic Conditions','Ms.Vinaya S M,  Roll No.CE22D038','Ph.D Scholar','Dr. Lelitha Devi V - Guide , Dr. Benny Raphael - DC Member , Dr. Gitakrishnan Ramadurai - DC Member, Dr.Shankar Ram C.

The\r\nbasic type of signals, which are commonly used in many countries, are fixed-time traffic\r\nsignals. The cycle length and green timings of these signals are predetermined based on the\r\nhistorical data. A significant amount of research has been reported in the area of optimisation\r\nof fixed-time signals, mostly developed considering a traffic signal as a queuing system and\r\napplying queuing theory concepts. However, these studies primarily considered the queuing\r\nsystem as having random arrivals, deterministic departures and one server per lane, which\r\nmay be meaningful under the homogeneous and lane-disciplined (HoLD) traffic conditions.\r\nHence, the direct adaption of those models in multi-class and lane-free traffic conditions\r\n(MCLF), existing in many countries, including India, may lead to inefficient signals. A study\r\nfocusing on developing signal control strategies for MCLF traffic considering the unique\r\ncharacteristics and features does not currently exist. Hence, this research aims to develop an\r\noptimal delay-based signal control strategy for MCLF traffic conditions by relaxing the\r\nunderlying assumptions in conventional models that are violated under MCLF traffic\r\nconditions. To develop a delay-based optimal signal design, a delay model will first be\r\nproposed that incorporates MCLF traffic characteristics, including multiple vehicle classes,\r\nlane-free movement, arrival and service processes, number of servers, and queue discipline.\r\nSince the study addresses both under-saturated and over-saturated conditions, both steady-\r\nstate and time-dependent delay models may be necessary for accurate delay estimation.\r\nFinally, these theoretical delay models will be employed to develop a fixed-time signal\r\ncontrol strategy by finding optimal signal timings through analytical methods or numerical\r\nsolutions.','Manikandan R, CE Office','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-13 04:36:58','Active'),(1089,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Environmental Dimension of Antimicrobial Resistance: Assessment through Resistome Mapping and Metagenomics, and Control through Novel Electrochemical Methods','Ms. Thara M V, Roll No. CE20D091','Ph.D Research Scholar','Dr. Indumathi M Nambi - Guide , Dr. Balaji  Narasimhan - DC Member , Dr. Soumendra Nath Kuiry - DC Member , Dr. Karthik Raman ( DA ) - DC Member , Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head\r\n','Department Of Civil Engineering','2024/08/16 15:00','2024-08-16','yes','BSB 104, Conference Room','Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a significant environmental challenge, particularly in\r\nwater systems impacted by wastewater discharge.

The\r\ndesigns have evolved gradually over the years catering to the pressure, temperature, and emission\r\nrequirements of modern GT engines. The use of empirical methods, network methods, and\r\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods individually and also as hybrids have been explored\r\nwith various degrees of success in the literature. In recent years, a large design space combined with\r\nnumerous conflicting objectives of a combustion system has resulted in research focused mostly on\r\ndesign optimization. Although these studies are useful, they are generally lagging on several fronts\r\nincluding adequate validation of numerical models, consistency of boundary conditions, workflow\r\nimplementation details for replication, performance uncertainty quantification, and handling of\r\ndesign space discontinuity issues. The current work focuses on developing a preliminary design\r\nmethodology for the aerodesign of a gas turbine combustor using CFD as its integral component. The\r\nhighlighted drawbacks are addressed by combining different design tools and methods and building\r\na framework for analyzing and optimizing a combustor.\r\nA swirl-stabilized, can-type diffusion GT combustor is used for this study. 1D flow network model and\r\nturbulent combustion models for the combustor are validated against experimental measurements.\r\nA Central Composite Design (CCD) scheme is used for the Design of Experiment (DOE) study with\r\nthree geometric design variables: swirl number, secondary hole diameter, and dilution hole\r\ndiameter. Using the CFD runs for DOE design points and additional refinement points, a Response\r\nSurface (RS) is generated using the Genetic Aggregation algorithm. The interpretation of response\r\nsurfaces in the light of combustor physics, issues associated with blow-off zone in the design space,\r\nand ways to address them are discussed. A multi-objective optimization (MOO) of the combustor is\r\ncarried out on the predicted response surfaces, trade-offs using the Pareto fronts are presented, and\r\ncandidate optimal designs are proposed. A six-sigma-based DOE analysis of one of the candidate\r\noptimal designs shows the uncertainty in combustor performance based on the variation in design\r\nvariables. The design space for the combustor is then expanded to include mass flow split and\r\nannulus area ratio. The challenges of studying and extracting useful insights from a larger design\r\nspace are also highlighted.\r\nTwo methods are proposed, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Machine learning (ML) based\r\nclassification algorithms, to address some of the challenges highlighted in the response surface\r\n\r\noptimization process. PCA is used on the design data to present a quasi-quantitative picture of the\r\noverall combustor performance. The use of classification algorithms for identifying blow-off zones in\r\nthe design space is also presented.\r\nThis comprehensive presentation of validation, implementation, design space exploration,\r\nuncertainty quantification, and the use of ML methods in GT combustor design, can guide design\r\nmodifications of current combustion systems and novel combustor concepts geared toward future\r\nrequirements.','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link meet.google.com/qgx-kygr-ggp','','',1,'2024-08-13 10:12:20','Active'),(1095,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Investigating Bacterial cell viability using optical techniques for efficient treatment management','Mr.Kiran Philip Issac (AM21D021)','Ph.D. research scholar, Dept. of Applied Mechanics & Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras','Guide - Dr. N Sujatha','Department of Applied Mechanics & Biomedical Engineering','2024/08/19 15:00','2024-08-19','yes','Online meeting link - https://meet.google.com/swr-oiof-kiy','Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a unicellular, gram-negative prokaryotic organism with a rod-shaped\r\nstructure and dimensions in the micron range, known for its infectious nature.

Among the different types of brain activity that can be used for this purpose, Motor Imagery (MI) is a natural way of modulating neuronal activity through the imagination of voluntary muscle movements. Each imagined movement can be translated into a specific command for the external device, allowing the user to control it using their thoughts. However, its performance depends on how well the user\'s intentions can be decoded.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, many successful and promising BCI systems that utilized MI have been proposed. However, most of these systems operate in a synchronous or cue-paced mode, where the user\'s mental activity is externally paced by the computer\'s instructions. Asynchronous BCI systems, on the other hand, allow users to perform mental activities whenever they choose. However, these systems have significantly lower performance than synchronous BCI systems. In asynchronous systems, the analysis of brain activity must be done in real-time on ongoing EEG signals, which can be challenging. It is essential here to maximize the true detections of intended mental events while minimizing the false detections of non-intended mental events that occur during the resting or idling periods. Hence, in this study, alternate and improved frameworks are explored to increase the true detection rate and decrease the false detection rate of intended and non-intended MI events, respectively, in ongoing EEG.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed frameworks are based on the low-rank matrix decomposition strategy, which is a popular data representation approach. It involves breaking down the data matrix into its low-rank component and noise parts. The low-rank matrix mainly captures the global structure of the data, providing semantic interpretations of the data. To enhance performance in asynchronous BCI systems, this study explores three low-rank representation-based classification methods called sparse representation-based classification (SRC), subspace method of classification (SMC), and difference subspace method of classification (DSMC). All the proposed classification models are evaluated on two publicly available benchmark datasets known from BCI competitions. These datasets contain raw EEG data suitable for simulating asynchronous analysis. Accuracy, along with statistical metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and Cohen\'s Kappa coefficient, is used for evaluating the user\'s intent detection performance. The results obtained from the demonstrations depict that the subspace and difference subspace-based classification frameworks have the potential to be a de facto standard for asynchronous BCI systems.\r\n','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline meeting link - https://meet.google.com/wyy-kccb-efb','','',1,'2024-08-13 11:50:27','Active'),(1098,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€œOn Stanley\'s tree isomorphism conjecture and its digraph analoguesâ€ ','Mr. Sagar S Sawant, MA18D015','Research Scholar, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','DC Members: Dr. P.

The\r\nnumber of transistors that can be concomitantly active inside a processor is limited by\r\nthe inability of the cooling solutions to take away heat. Consequently, the upper bound\r\nof computing performance is inherently determined by the efficiency of the cooling\r\nsolutions. Two-phase immersion cooling has emerged as a promising solution in this\r\ncontext, particularly for high-performance computing applications. However, the poor\r\nthermal conductivity of the dielectric fluids and the effect of non-condensable gases in\r\nthe system impede the efficiency of the two-phase immersion-cooled system. To address\r\nthese challenges, a multi-fluid system approach is proposed. In this configuration, two\r\nimmiscible fluids are used: a denser, lower boiling point fluid for direct immersion of\r\nheat-generating processors and a lighter fluid with higher thermal conductivity where the\r\nvapours of the boiling fluid condense. These fluids are arranged in series without a solid\r\ninterface separating them. Due to significant differences in density, polarity, and volatility,\r\nthe boiling and condensing fluids remain immiscible, forming a distinct separation within\r\nthe system, ensuring the efficiency of the system. The effect of condensing fluid in the\r\nsystem is efficacious in improving heat transfer and coolant condensation with negligible\r\neffect of non-condensable gases. The experimental investigations reveal that multi-fluid\r\nsystems demonstrate superior cooling performance compared to single-fluid systems,\r\nwith an average increase of 33.3% in the overall heat transfer coefficient.\r\nTransitioning to the next phase of thermal management, the focus shifts to ensuring\r\nreliable operations in data centre applications. This requires the development of a practical\r\nand proactive control framework for immersion cooling systems, which necessitates the\r\nprediction of the server temperature. While deep learning-based temperature prediction\r\nmodels have shown effectiveness, further enhancement is needed to improve their\r\nprediction accuracy. In this context, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks\r\nbased on recursive encoder-decoder architecture and attention mechanisms have been\r\nexplored to improve forecasting accuracy and prediction horizon. The training data for\r\nthe proposed deep learning models are collected through in-house experiments using a\r\ntwo-phase immersion cooling system developed in the laboratory. The training data set\r\ncontains real-world data centre traces like traffic bursts, long-running tasks, short-lived\r\nthermal spikes, and stress-testing scenarios. The experiments are semi-automated by\r\nusing the LabVIEW programming to interface the data acquisition unit and the power\r\nsource. A comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the model and its sensitivity\r\nto factors like sampling periods, window size and noise in the training data are explored\r\nin this work. Encoder-decoder LSTM models are found to be 14% more effective than\r\nvanilla LSTM models, while attention-based models further enhance performance by an\r\naverage of 19% on a dataset collected from a Raspberry Pi module.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','Two-phase immersion cooling; Multi fluid two-phase immersion cooling; Data centre thermal management','','',1,'2024-08-14 01:18:36','Active'),(1100,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Predictive Synchronous Rectification Control Scheme for Resonant DC-DC Converters for Battery Charging and Telecom Application','Mr. Nagesha C (EE20D009)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Lakshminarasamma ','Electrical Engineering','2024/08/22 14:00','2024-08-22','yes','ESB 244',' Synchronous rectifier schemes for the resonant DC-DC converter significantly improve the power conversion efficiency.

To facilitate this, numerous multiport converter topologies with a reduced number of components have been proposed in the literature. One such multiport topology, the 3-port converter, has been proposed in a prior work of the authors. This converter minimizes the number of switches while integrating different distributed energy resources, resulting in increased current flows in some of the devices, which increases the losses in the system. To address this challenge, this work develops a loss minimization algorithm for the 3-port converter topology in a real-time environment. The proposed algorithm derives an analytical expression for power loss considering different power loss components and only two control variables, which facilitates easier implementation in a real-time environment. The obtained power loss function is minimized using a simple gradient-descent-based deterministic optimization approach. To reduce the computational burden in the optimization process, a graphical analysis is done, which assists in choosing appropriate input parameters. Further, to implement the optimized results, a novel port current angle adjustment strategy is proposed that embeds the results of the optimization process into the microgrid control by adjusting the dq0 voltage angles.

This work proposes a high-gain, single-stage, isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter derived from the base topology of a dual active bridge (DAB) converter called the pole point inductor-based dual active bridge (PPI-DAB) converter. The primary bridge is a current-fed boost full bridge (CF-BFB), and the secondary bridge is a typical full bridge (FB). The gain of the PPI-DAB is twice of a DAB. This topology is compared with the previous version proposed in the literature. The converter dynamics are studied by modeling using the generalized averaged method (GAM). The equivalent circuit model and small-signal model are derived from the GAM. Alongside this, a DC bias current is observed in this converter due to the different currents flowing through the switches, creating an unbalanced volt-second balance equation, which generates a DC bias current in the auxiliary inductor, saturating the high-frequency transformer (HFT). The work presents a current mode control method to rectify this issue. The HFT is protected during transients due to the direct current control method. The control method is simulated on PLECS, and the results are validated by implementation using an experimental setup of a PPI-DAB converter. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the current control method for the proposed PPI-DAB converter.

They constitute large family of chemicals found in many of the materials used in daily life which are eventually released in gaseous form because of the high vapor pressures and volatility. Isoprene, CCl4, benzene etc., are some of the examples of VOCs and most of the natural emissions are benign to mankind. Their emission from anthropogenic sources mostly proven to have serious health hazards. Their reactions with atmospheric detergents such as Chlorine atom (Cl), Hydroxyl radical (OH), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) radicals produce secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) which further adds to the health hazards and tropospheric ozone layer production. The concentration of such oxidants depends on the geographical location, hinting at regional dependency of their source reaction. The kinetics of these reactions are important to be studied to estimate the factors such as ozone creation potential, global warming potential, atmospheric lifetimes which predicts the effect of such compounds on Earthâ€™s troposphere. Computational studies have gained importance due to its vital contribution of predicting the kinetics and thermodynamics of complex reactions and the experimental kinetic determination have resulted in real life understanding of these radical kinetics.\r\nIn this seminar, effects of VOCs on our atmosphere, the kinetic results (experimental and computational) of atmospherically relevant compounds and the use of these results in determining the above-mentioned parameters will be discussed.

Studies conducted in different\r\npH ranges revealed that the performance was good alkaline region and poor in the acidic\r\nrange due to the destruction of crosslinks by the acidic groups. Studies using a mixture of\r\nTET and MNZ showed that the hydrogel selectively sorbed the water leaving behind a\r\nconcentrate of the PPCPs.

Finally, the prepared hydrogels were applied for water recovery and\r\npollutant removal. The synthesized Fe-Mg nanoparticles and hydroxyapatite were able to\r\nremove TET and MNZ from the aqueous phase when applied to real-time secondary effluent.\r\nIn contrast, applying hydrogels to the real-time effluent exhibited selective sorption of water.\r\nThe outcome of the experimental results in this regard will be discussed in this seminar.','Manikandan.

The Finite Volume Method (FVM) was employed for the flow simulation, while the Finite Element Method (FEM) was used for the geomechanics, both integrated through a staggered scheme. The aperture evolution equation was solved to quantify the width of newly created fractures, providing an accurate estimate of the permeability field within the medium. The computational code, developed entirely in C, utilized the PETSc iterative solver for efficiently solving the system of equations.\r\n\r\nThe study was conducted in several phases, beginning with an investigation into the enhancement of flow rate due to hydraulic fracturing. Initial results demonstrated significant improvements in flow rate, validating the effectiveness of the hydraulic fracturing process. Subsequently, the research domain was refined to incorporate more realistic boundary conditions, including in-situ stresses, flow and no-flow boundaries, and variations in permeability and domain size. These studies provided deeper insights into how these factors influence flow rate, enhancing the model\'s applicability to real-world scenarios.\r\n\r\nA critical advancement in this research was the modification of the phase field model to account for mixed-mode fracturing. This modified model was rigorously validated against existing experimental and simulation data from literature for a compression test in dry rock. Application of this model to a fluid-saturated excavation site under overburden load revealed that post-excavation de-stressing led to the propagation of natural fractures. The mixed-mode phase field model demonstrated superior performance, capturing a higher number of fractures and capturing horizontal displacements of an order of magnitude higher than those predicted by traditional phase field models. These findings underscore the importance of the mixed-mode phase field model for assessing construction processes and ensuring safety, addressing a gap in the existing literature.\r\n\r\nCurrent efforts are directed towards employing FEM for both flow and geomechanical aspects, facilitating the use of unstructured grids in simulations of fracture propagation and tunnel stability. Preliminary results from this approach have been promising, indicating potential for further advancements in the modeling of complex geological systems.\r\n','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline Meeting link : https://meet.google.com/gmk-wmit-pyd ','','',1,'2024-08-19 04:15:12','Active'),(1116,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\"Exploring megadalton clusters with atomic precisionâ€','Mr. Sooraj B S (CY19D064)','Ph.D Research scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide- Professor Pradeep T, DC Chairperson- Professor Rajakumar B, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/08/26 16:30','2024-08-26','yes','CB-310, Chemistry Seminar Hall','Metallic nanoparticles display unique optical, electronic, and chemical properties compared to their bulk counterparts.1 The properties of clusters are strongly dependent on their core size, where the small molecular clusters are drastically different from the large plasmonic ones.2 The molecular-to-metallic transition in clusters has been an interesting question since the last decade.3 We explore the role of ligands and metal doping in the electron dynamics of larger metallic clusters, which sheds light on the mechanism of molecular-to-metallic transition.

The existing multi-image based reflection removal methods require input images to be captured at sufficiently different view points with large baselines. A more convenient way for the user is to capture a burst of images using a hand-held device such as a smartphone. Our method exploits the cues that rely on subtle handshakes created during the capture process to efficiently remove reflections. We extract these novel cues called as reflection motion aggregation (RMA) cues to guide the reflection removal in a two stage manner. Further, we propose a reference based approach for reflection removal where a multi-stage architecture is deployed to first extract novel cues from a given reference image which acts as a guide to efficiently remove reflections. This cue is extracted by matching neural features between the input image corrupted by reflections and the given reflection free reference image. We also extend this idea to build a large database of easily source-able reflection free images that are publicly available. The proposed method initially retrieves a small subset of semantically similar images from this database followed by a novel reflection aware feature extractor (RAFE) to create a semantic feature dictionary (SFD). The SFD contains features that are mostly invariant to the presence of reflections. These SFD features are later used to guide the reflection removal process.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/qyb-xtsg-ega','','',1,'2024-08-19 06:41:25','Active'),(1118,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€œPOWER-ENERGY DENSE HYBRID SUPERCAPACITORS CRAFTED FROM CARBON AND CARBON-REDOX ORGANIC COMPOSITES IN AQUEOUS AND SOLID-STATE CONFIGURATIONSâ€','Ms. Potham Sravani (CY18D131)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide- Professor Kothandaraman R, DC Chairperson- Prof. Dhamodharan R, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/08/21 12:00','2024-08-21','yes','Online-Google Meet','','CY OFFICE','cyoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','ALL ARE WELCOME-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/gya-azqf-cyo','','',1,'2024-08-19 09:49:19','Active'),(1119,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Design of a Low-power Time-Interleaved SAR ADC for the Backend of a Continuous Time Pipelined ADC','Mr. Nagabhushana Rao(EE21S039)','MS Scholar','Guide: Prof. Shanthi Pavan','Electrical Engineering','2024/08/21 17:00','2024-08-21','yes','ESB244 / Hybrid','This work focuses on the design of a low-power Successive Approximation Register Analog-to-Digital Converter(SAR-ADC) that uses a monotonic capacitor switching procedure to reduce the average switching energy and total capacitance compared to converters that use the conventional method.

We introduce a custom-designed sandwich capacitor to address parasitics associated with the top plate and leverage segmentation to lower the required capacitance further. Careful attention is given to ratio matching between capacitor components (C, Cc) to ensure accuracy with random variations. Additionally, splitting the Most Significant Bit (MSB) capacitors mitigates common-mode variations. The design incorporates relaxed specifications for comparator noise due to the front-end gain provided by Continuous time pipelined ADC (CTP), resulting in a low-area comparator since the dynamic range of the SAR-ADC in the CTP is only half of the full scale, reducing the impact of absolute offset. Finally, the implementation features simple digital logic for asynchronous, self-timed SAR control, streamlining the overall design and enhancing efficiency.','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/ctf-xzba-mds','','',1,'2024-08-19 10:26:17','Active'),(1120,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','RESPONSE CONTROL OF SEMISUBMERSIBLE USING PASSIVE DAMPER','Mr.Ajaya Kumar Das, OE23D008','Mr.Ajaya Kumar Das, OE23D008, Ph.D Scholar','Prof. Srinivasan Chandrasekaran - Guide','OCEAN ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT','2024/08/21 15:00','2024-08-21','','SEMINAR HALL, DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','Oil and gas exploration, production, and processing are on a consistent growth and demand\r\nwith the increased infrastructure development.

Across the world, it affects 1 in 4 adults,  and both men and women are equally susceptible. It has been noted that among the hypertensive population, about 50% of them have neurogenic origin. In neurogenic hypertension, the central nervous system plays a major causative role for the increase in blood pressure. The major mechanism involved is the signal from the cardioregulatory brain regions, triggering sympathetic nerve activity in the peripheral organ such as the kidney which increases the release of catecholamines such as norepinephrine and epinephrine leading to blood vessel constriction and increase blood pressure. Previous studies show that the increase in sympathetic nerve activity can also be caused due to brain oxidative stress leading to DNA damage. Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a post translational modification enzyme which gets activated during DNA damage and adds ADP ribose to the target protein using NAD+ as a substrate. However, the molecular mechanism involved in PARP mediated increased sympathetic nerve activity is not studied yet. The major aim of this study is to unravel the oxidative stress mediated PARP alteration and its involvement in the development of neurogenic hypertension.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-20 06:02:39','Active'),(1122,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Polymer Pattern Formation via Evaporation-Induced Self-Assembly','Ms. SHAKSHI GUPTA, (PH18D007)','PhD Scholar','Guide: Dr. DILLIP KUMAR SATAPATHY','Department of Physics','2024/08/27 16:00','2024-08-27','yes','HSB-209, Seminar Hall, Department of Physics ','Understanding the drying kinetics and resulting evaporative patterns of polymer-laden droplets on solid surfaces is crucial for applications in coating, printing, medical diagnostics, and microfluidics.

This unusual drying behavior leads to a variety of patterns, from central deposits to fringe-like structures, achieved by varying polymer concentration and molecular weight.

While graphite anodes utilize intercalation, high-capacity anodes form lithium compounds (e.g., Li22Si5, Li2Sn), leading to distinct phase formations during charging and discharging (Hong et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2017). Phase-Field models effectively illustrate the two-phase lithiation process and stress evolution in Si anodes, yet many models impose Dirichlet boundary conditions, neglecting critical electrochemical interactions beyond the boundary (McDowell et al., 2013). Such limitations prevent accurate depiction of the interplay between chemical, mechanical, and electrochemical phenomena, essential for understanding battery performance. Given the complexity of LIBs, which involve chemical diffusion, phase transformations, mechanical deformation, stress, fractures, and charge movements, numerical modeling becomes indispensable for isolating and analyzing these effects. Therefore, this work proposes to develop a unified phase field model to study the electrochemical response during lithiation, explore the impact of phase separation and mechanical deformation on electrochemical responses, and incorporate multiple phases into the lithiation model.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','References: â€¢	C.

','The pervasive integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into societal-scale systems is reshaping our interactions within physical infrastructure and emerging online services. Unfortunately, the standard ML paradigm, which relies on a stationary environment, proves inadequate in such contexts. For instance, various algorithms independently learn and adapt in these dynamic, uncertain, and resource-constrained environments in a decentralized manner, i.e., without communicating and coordinating with one another. Such interactions lead to non-stationarity in the learning data received by any algorithm. Drawing on examples from my research, I will highlight how to incorporate tools from diverse disciplines, such as ML, algorithmic game theory, optimization, and dynamical systems, to effectively overcome the challenges associated with the design and analysis of decentralized learning algorithms. Specifically, I will focus on two vignettes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, I will discuss the problem of decentralized learning in uncertain, resource-constrained environments.

In these systems, cryptography plays a crucial role in ensuring the security and privacy of communicated data and the authenticity of the firmware that is executed on the device. Even though the security guarantees of cryptographic algorithms are well-studied and investigated, the weakest link is often due to the implementation rather than the mathematical underpinning. The weaknesses can manifest in various attacks and are a serious concern, primarily because many IoT devices are deployed in critical cyber-physical systems where a compromised device could result in significant losses. We focus on two critical weaknesses in the crypto implementations, namely, Fault Injection Attacks and Improper Realizations. These weaknesses pose significant threats to the security and integrity of crypto software, necessitating the development of robust detection and mitigation strategies. We propose automated tools to enhance the security of embedded crypto-software by detecting and patching different Common Weaknesses and Enumerations (CWEs) associated with fault injection attacks and improper realizations.\r\n\r\nFault Injection attacks are one of the most powerful forms of cryptanalytic attacks, where the attacker induces faults during the execution of the cipher to retrieve the secret key. Software implementations of ciphers need to be thoroughly evaluated for fault injection attacks. We proposed different automated frameworks to detect and patch fault attack vulnerabilities. The tools can introduce countermeasures appropriately to meet the target\'s requirement for security and performance.\r\n\r\nImproper realizations of cipher implementations occur when essential cryptographic steps are either omitted or incorrectly implemented. The complexity of crypto implementations and their huge search space makes detecting these flaws challenging. This vulnerability exposes the system to risks, even if the intended security measures are present. We leverage model-checking techniques to determine improper realizations of public key crypto-systems with respect to their formal specification. We demonstrate how the huge state space of an Elliptic Curve Cryptography library can be aptly verified using a hierarchical assume-guarantee verification strategy.','CS Office','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-21 10:55:13','Active'),(1126,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Evaluating the Optical Properties of Bubbles and Microplastics Using Radiative Transfer Models and Experimental Techniques in Oceanic waters','Mr.Chavapati Gouse Sandhnai - OE18D006','Mr.Chavapati Gouse Sandhnai ,OE18D006, Ph.D Scholar','Prof. SHANMUGAM P   - GUIDE','OCEAN ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT','2024/08/23 16:00','2024-08-23','','SEMINAR HALL, DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','The effect of the bubbles on the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), used the Hydrolight model for predicting the Rrs values. The Hydrolight is a radiative transfer numerical model that computes radiance distributions and derived quantities for natural waters. The Hydrolight can be run with inherent optical properties (IOP) as input such as the absorption coefficient, attenuation coefficient and backscattering coefficient. The bubble cloud present in the upper surface layer in the oceanic waters abruptly changes the remote sensing properties in the water column. The backscattering coefficient recorded by the satellite coming from the surface layer due to water constituents(wc) present in the water column coupled with bubble layer will have the value 2-4 times more than without the bubble layer. The Remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) depends upon the upwelling radiance and the irradiance terms. The bubble cloud will show increment in the upwelling radiance and thereby an increment in the Rrs. So, the effect of the bubble cloud has shown using the HydroLight radiative transfer model in this paper. The bubble layer influences the light signal captured by the satellite in open oceanic water. The ocean watercolor will be greener in the satellite ocean colour data than the field data due to the bubble layer. From this signal, the retrieval of the water constituentâ€™s estimation will increase by more than 40% than the field values. The underwater bubble cloud has influenced not only chlorophyll and also on Turbidity and Coloured dissolved organic matter.

The artificial breaking of the waves will form the bubble layer has examined to show the effect on the underwater light field. The experiment results show the Rrs magnitude has increased 4-5 times in the area due to bubbles.

Utilizing optical-based techniques is crucial for the accurate detection and quantification of these microplastics, contributing significantly to the mitigation and reduction of marine pollution and its possible with the optical satellite remote sensing techniques because of the large area coverage. The satellites are recording the backscattered signal coming from the upper surface ocean layer and the optical characteristics of microplastics are unknown. The primary focus of this study is to measure the optical characteristics of the microplastics based on the laboratory experiments and theoretical models and it is the first study. The microplastics considered in this study are polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The particle size distribution, shape and composition of the microplastics are measured in the laboratory by using the static light scattering (SLS), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) instruments. The SLS results reveal that the median particle size (D_50) of the microplastic samples is in the range of 2-3 Âµm and the SEM examination indicates that PE and PVC particles are of spherical shape and the PP and PS particles are characterized as angular/irregular shape. The experimental investigations are conducted in a controlled laboratory environment, utilizing a multi-angle polarized light scattering (LISST-VSF) meter. The obtained VSF results from the experiments revealed that the microplastics are exhibiting different scattering behaviour compared to natural oceanic particles, mainly a pronounced scattering phenomenon in the backward scattering angles (1000-1200). \r\n','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-22 06:08:40','Active'),(1127,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- பார்வையாளர்கள்  (Parvaiyaalargal) \r\nHindi word	- दर्शक (Darshak)\r\nEnglish word	- Audience ','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-08-22 06:18:45','default_value'),(1128,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Novel interferometric methods for Tilt measurement at nanoscale and Ultra low velocity measurement','Mr. LAXMAN MANDAL, (PH20D751)','PhD Scholar','Guide: Dr. GANESAN A R','Department of Physics','2024/08/29 15:00','2024-08-29','yes','HSB-209, Seminar Hall, Department of Physics ','Precise measurement of tilt angles plays a critical role in numerous scientific and industrial applications.

The development of\r\nsingle-cell patterning allows to manipulate and selectively positioning the cells in spatially\r\ndistinct areas.

Moreover, it provides a\r\nplatform for studying distinctive cell-states as well as cell-to-cell interaction. Additionally, it\r\nis favorable in situations where the sample is scarce by retaining cell heredity. Therefore,\r\nsingle-cell patterning has emerged as a high- throughput platform that can revolutionize\r\ncellular research. Albeit significant complications and challenges abound, given their relevance\r\nin fundamental biology as well as in other downstream applications, the single-cell patterning\r\ntechnology need to be continuously explored and improved, as a bioengineering solution over\r\nthe current traditional cell culture platform.\r\nThe first work presents a high-throughput single-cell patterning approach using microcontact\r\nprinting, which transfers a liquid precursor pattern onto a substrate. The technique involves a\r\nmicro-pillar polydimethylsiloxane stamp with different diameters, imprinting distinct proteins\r\nand patterning single-cell to small clusters of cells.

By aligning the device on top\r\nof the patterned cells and exposing it to infrared light pulses, we were able to achieve massively\r\nparallel optoporation-mediated intracellular delivery of small to large biomolecules such as PI\r\ndye, Dextran, siRNA, and enzyme. The delivery efficiency for these biomolecules is\r\n\r\napproximately 95Â±3%, 97Â±1%, 96Â±1%, and 94Â±3%, with cell viability of 98Â±1%.

Automation is desirable for consistent results but requires\r\nsophisticated tools like photolithography for complex designs. The limitations of microcontact\r\nprinting techniques underscore the need for continuous improvement, innovation, and\r\nalternative solutions to improve their reliability, versatility, and accessibility, which we try to\r\naddress in the next works.\r\nIn the second work, a smarter approach for cell patterning was developed using PDMS-derived\r\ncarbon soot coated with a superhydrophobic layer and laser ablation.

The power circuit of OBC usually consists of two stages: an active front-end converter followed by a dc-dc conversion stage. The dual active bridge (DAB) converter is the most widely adopted topology for the dc-dc power conversion stage in electric vehicle (EV) battery charging owing to its inherent capabilities such as soft switching, galvanic isolation and bidirectional power flow. The focus of present research is on the DAB converter. \r\nFrom a detailed literature search it is learnt that the performance of DAB gets compromised when it operates over a wide voltage and power range during the battery charging process.

These intra-molecular interaction-networks serve as conduits for signal transmission contributing to regulation via both classical allosteric and \'dynamic\' allosteric mechanisms. While the precise mechanisms of signal transmission are debatable, a relatively less challenging question to address is the extent of signal propagation in equilibrium.\r\n\r\nTo explore this, we have designed a perturb-probe system involving an environment sensitive tryptophan in a helical protein domain, PDD. Following perturbations or mutations at distant sites, we probe for the response of this tryptophan via a combination of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements. Supplemented by scanning calorimetry experiments, statistical mechanical modeling and molecular simulations we find that mutations alter the inter-helical interactions in the native ensemble.\r\n\r\nMutations invariably affect the electronic environment of tryptophan even if they are located at distances greater than 15-20 Ang. from the mutated site. Specifically, we find distal mutations to promote an increasing disorder tendency of the environment around tryptophan, suggestive of weaker packing in the tens of mutants studied. Additional work on the larger system Cnu attests to the robustness of our observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','Publications:      A Disordered Loop Mediates Heterogeneous Unfolding of an Ordered Protein by Alter','','',1,'2024-08-23 06:34:08','Active'),(1136,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€œCircular 4 - Coloring of Signed Graphs and Complexity of Near-3-Choosability Problemâ€','Ms. Rohini S, MA17D017','Research Scholar, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras','DC Members: Dr. A V Jayanthan / Dr.Sounaka Mishra/ Dr. Amritanshu Prasad (IMSC) /\r\nGuide: Dr. N.

First, we examine how promoters switch between alignment and entrenchment and thereby shape the value relevance impact of IFRS convergence. We find that promoters exhibit an inverted â€œUâ€ shaped relationship with the IFRS value relevance impact and this effect is driven by domestic promoters and not foreign promoters. Next, we investigate the impact of institutional investors on stock price crash risk. Consistent with the bad news hoarding hypothesis, we find that FIIs mitigate crash risk through active monitoring.  Further analysis reveals that FIIâ€™s active monitoring reduces crash risk only when promoter equity holding is low. Lastly, to illustrate the stability role of promoters and institutional investors in influencing crash risk, we consider the unique scenario of pledging firms where the promotersâ€™ stable stock holding is destabilized due to margin call pressure. A Panel regression analysis demonstrates that institutional investors reduce pledging risk by supporting stock prices and reducing selling pressure. Further analysis reveals that this price support is provided by DIIs and is effective only in standalone pledging firms.

The BLSRP\'s unique design, featuring buoyant leg structures and hinged joints, minimizes heave response and maintains a positive metacentric height for safe and reliable operations. The symmetric design of the BLSRP enhances stability by ensuring a balanced distribution of forces, which is crucial for resisting environmental loads. This design also improves hydrodynamic performance, reduces motion response during operations, and simplifies construction and maintenance due to standardized components. The BLSRP platforms are designed to store Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and facilitate the regasification of the processed gas for supply. As LNG demand rises globally, efficient offshore regasification is crucial, with the BLSRP providing cost savings and environmental benefits compared to onshore terminals. However, during regasification, the platform may experience significant displacements and motion responses, increasing fire hazards due to the large LNG storage volume. Prior research lacks a control mechanism to manage the movement of the buoyant legs. Incorporating dampers helps control the dynamic response, ensuring safe operations in offshore conditions. The present research aims to develop a response control mechanism that consists of passive and semi-active control devices. A set of linear spring assemblies serves as a passive control mechanism, while a set of magnetorheological (MR) dampers functions as a semi-active control mechanism, both connected to each buoyant leg. An MR damper uses a smart fluid that can rapidly change its viscosity when exposed to a magnetic field, allowing for variable damping force control. The entire control mechanism is rigidly fixed at the bottom center of the deck with a central shaft. The stiffness of the springs provides a restoring force to return the buoyant leg to its original position. By varying the current, the magnetic field strength is adjusted, which in turn changes the viscosity of the MR fluid, allowing for real-time control of vibration and motion of the buoyant leg, thereby enhancing the performance of the BLSRP in dynamic marine environments.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-26 04:19:20','Active'),(1143,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- இணைப்பு (Inaippu) \r\nHindi word	- संलग्नक (Sanlagnak)\r\nEnglish word	- Attachment ','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-08-26 04:57:29','default_value'),(1144,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Architecting Polymer Composites for Durability and Damage Tolerance â€œAn Advanced Manufacturing and Mechanics Approachâ€','Dr. Pavana Prabhakar, Charles G.

Utilizing polymer-based geosynthetic reinforcement for various applications in pavements has been successfully used for the past few decades. However, with the growing awareness towards the environment and climate change, there is a constant lookout for energy-efficient and sustainable reinforcing materials for road construction (specifically for low-volume rural roads). Natural coir fibres can be considered as an alternative which are entirely sustainable, eco-friendly, and cost-effective. Woven coir geotextiles, in particular, have garnered attention for enhancing the load-bearing capacity of subgrade and maintaining acceptable settlement limits when used in pavement. Nevertheless, coir fibres also has few inherent drawbacks, such as its hydrophilic nature, relatively lower tensile strength \\& stiffness compared to synthetic fibres, and non-uniform geometrical characteristics leading to improper bonding/ interaction with the surrounding geomaterials. Therefore, it is crucial to consider these limitations to optimize the use of coir fibres as reinforcement in various applications.\r\nThe current study focuses on improving the strength and durability of coir geotextiles in addition to quantifying their interfacial behavior and load-bearing characteristics when used as reinforcement within the soil. Woven geotextiles especially with predefined aperture size and thickness play an important role in shear mobilization during pullout loading. The individual contributions of frictional and bearing resistance due to different mass densities, thickness, and stiffness of coir geotextiles is evaluated using both experimental and numerical methods. After arriving at an optimal mass density based on the interaction studies, the optimum depth for placing the coir geotextile in the pavement and the corresponding load dispersion angle will be ascertained. One of the major concerns towards the usage of coir geotextiles in pavements is its low stiffness. An alternate technique such as pre-tensioning of the coir geotextiles and its impact on the stress-deformation characteristics under static and cyclic conditions will be explored. Additionally, the improvement in the load dispersion angle, the load-bearing capacity and the reduction in rut depth under cyclic loading conditions for pre-tensioned coir geotextile is evaluated. Finally, a suitable treatment technique will be proposed to enhance the characteristics of coir fibres using a biopolymer. This treatment can mitigate the inherent surface defects of the coir fibres and improve the strength and durability, making them more suitable geo-reinforcement in pavement layers and other geotechnical engineering applications.\r\n','R.

However, the hydrogen value chain faces significant challenges in production, storage, transportation, and distribution. Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) water electrolysers can be operated at higher current densities with better energy efficiency under highly pressurised conditions when compared to Alkaline water electrolysers. The levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) depends on capital and operational costs. This study aims to reduce capital and operational costs by reducing component costs or specific energy consumption by adopting different types of PEM-based electrolyser techniques, respectively.\r\nOne of the major components, metallic flow field plates, contributes 49% to the stack cost. A modification was made using patterned Pt coating on Ti6Al4V alloy as flow field plates in PEM electrolyser stacks. The studies show excellent corrosion resistance and performance. The durable conductive patterned Pt-coated Ti6Al4V surfaces were characterized using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM). Potentiodynamic studies confirmed the improved corrosion resistance of the coated plates, and their durability was assessed over the extended operation in a single-cell PEM electrolyser setup.\r\nAdditionally, the PEM-based Electrochemical Methanol Reformer (ECMR) process is explored as an alternative to the energy-intensive water electrolysers. ECMR operates at near-ambient conditions, requiring less electrical energy (1/3rd of the water electrolysers) and eliminates the need for separate hydrogen purification systems, making it an attractive option. A systematic investigation of the effects of various operating parameters on the performance of ECMR under pressurized conditions was carried out. The developed system can produce pressurized hydrogen without the need for external compressors, unlike PEM water electrolysers.\r\nLastly, the electrochemical oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols, specifically methanol and ethanol, was investigated within a PEM electrolyser at 65Â°C. Using Pt-Ru/C as the anode catalyst, the investigation aimed to identify the effect of methanol and ethanol concentrations on cell voltage and energy consumption. The results indicate that both alcohols, particularly at a 2 M concentration, result in low cell voltages and promising energy consumption rates. Thus, methanol and ethanol can be alternative reactants in a flexible PEM-based electrochemical reformer. The performance of the reformer improved with cycling, as observed through reduced cell voltages and no intermediate by-products, confirming the efficiency and reliability.

However, conventional cell-culture uses a bulk population of cells\r\nattached randomly on a substrate and neglects cell population diversity. It is plausibly primitive\r\nand with low throughput and expensive human labor and/or equipment. The development of\r\nsingle-cell patterning allows to manipulate and selectively positioning the cells in spatially\r\ndistinct areas. The bulk cell population investigation provides a weighted average of data,\r\n\r\nunderestimating biological variability in cells, missing crucial information. In contrast, single-\r\ncell patterning accounts for cell-heterogeneity and provides statistical power in biological data\r\n\r\nacquisition, acquiring longitudinal sets of data at a single-cell level. Moreover, it provides a\r\nplatform for studying distinctive cell-states as well as cell-to-cell interaction. Additionally, it\r\nis favorable in situations where the sample is scarce by retaining cell heredity. Therefore,\r\nsingle-cell patterning has emerged as a high- throughput platform that can revolutionize\r\ncellular research. Albeit significant complications and challenges abound, given their relevance\r\nin fundamental biology as well as in other downstream applications, the single-cell patterning\r\ntechnology need to be continuously explored and improved, as a bioengineering solution over\r\nthe current traditional cell culture platform.\r\nThe first work presents a high-throughput single-cell patterning approach using microcontact\r\nprinting, which transfers a liquid precursor pattern onto a substrate. The technique involves a\r\nmicro-pillar polydimethylsiloxane stamp with different diameters, imprinting distinct proteins\r\nand patterning single-cell to small clusters of cells. The efficiency of this method is 97-99%\r\nand is universal for any protein-cell combination. This single-cell patterned platform was\r\nutilized as an intracellular biomolecule delivery platform, which is crucial for analyzing and\r\nengineering cell functions. A two-dimensional array of titanium micro-dish (TMD) device was\r\ncreated that facilitate near infrared laser mediated optoporation. By aligning the device on top\r\nof the patterned cells and exposing it to infrared light pulses, we were able to achieve massively\r\nparallel optoporation-mediated intracellular delivery of small to large biomolecules such as PI\r\ndye, Dextran, siRNA, and enzyme. The delivery efficiency for these biomolecules is\r\n\r\napproximately 95Â±3%, 97Â±1%, 96Â±1%, and 94Â±3%, with cell viability of 98Â±1%. The\r\ncompact, robust, and simple-to-print cell patterning approach has potential for single-cell\r\ntherapy and diagnostics, as well as creating single-cell-level biological processes with high\r\nspecificity and subcellular accuracy.\r\nMicroconatct printing however has limitations such as its single ink per stamp nature, human\r\nerror, and expensive equipment. Automation is desirable for consistent results but requires\r\nsophisticated tools like photolithography for complex designs. The limitations of microcontact\r\nprinting techniques underscore the need for continuous improvement, innovation, and\r\nalternative solutions to improve their reliability, versatility, and accessibility, which we try to\r\naddress in the next works.\r\nIn the second work, a smarter approach for cell patterning was developed using PDMS-derived\r\ncarbon soot coated with a superhydrophobic layer and laser ablation. This innovative approach\r\nhas proven effective for various cell culture modalities, including 2D cell patterning, 3D\r\nhydrogel-encapsulated cell patterning, and 3D spheroid array formation via microdroplet\r\narrays. The substrate is easy to fabricate, cost-effective, user-friendly, and stable, making it\r\naccessible for widespread use in research settings.\r\nA multiprotein patterning-based cell coculture platform was established using a modified\r\nmicrocontact printing method that integrates microfluidics with microcontact printing. This\r\nplatform allows for the controlled coculture of many cell types, essential for studying collective\r\nresponses, in-vitro cell function research, and designing tissue constructions that closely mimic\r\nthe organizational complexity of in-vivo tissue structures. The modified microcontact printing\r\nprotocol allows for the patterning of multiple proteins side-by-side, enabling the creation of\r\nco-culture systems. The platform was validated by a coculture of tumor cells and fibroblasts,\r\nwith real-time monitoring of cell-cell interaction dynamics. This method can be applied as an\r\nanalytical tool in various scientific investigations concerning heterotypic cell-cell interactions.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','Keywords: Micro/nanofluidics, Surface modification, Cell adhesion, Micro/nano patterning, Cell manip','','',1,'2024-08-27 02:50:55','Active'),(1156,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Quantum dynamics and spacetime curvature','Mr. HARI K, (PH18D009)','PhD Scholar','Guide: Dr. DAWOOD KOTHAWALA','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/08/29 12:00','2024-08-29','yes','https://meet.google.com/jhc-dvab-kpd','Study of processes at the interface of quantum theory and gravity is an important research program that has the potential to yield useful insights for quantum gravity. One of the starting points for this program is to extend the framework of quantum field theory to curved spacetime, which is the so-called framework of semi-classical gravity. A number of well-known physical processes, such as Hawking and Unruh effects, were postulated by employing this approach and we have used this approach to study quantum effects in curved spacetime. In the theory of gravity, the principle of equivalence is important in understanding physical effects in curved spacetime. It is often used to generalize classical as well as quantum processes in flat to curved spacetime. Our results have revealed some interesting and non-trivial effects, which are not usually evident when one uses the principle of equivalence. One of our studies analyses what effects can be evoked in a local frame of reference if we can incorporate, in a specific way, the large-scale structure into a local patch of spacetime. We show that the large-scale structure can affect some physical effects that are classical and quantum mechanical. Another important study was on the effect of curvature on quantum probes, such as the Unruh-DeWitt detector, which acts as a quantum probe that responds to fluctuations in the quantum field. We found an important observation that in the presence of gravity, an accelerated or rotating detector can couple with the tidal acceleration due to the curvature of spacetime and affect the response of a detector in a non-trivial way. Further, to study the effect of curvature in quantum information processes, we analyzed the indirect yet universal role of spacetime curvature in creating entanglement between two quantum probes coupled to a scalar field in a suitable vacuum state. From the analysis, we propose that the features induced in entanglement can facilitate the use of entanglement as a probe of spacetime curvature. We also show that the orientation and relative motion of the quantum probes can also affect the entanglement between quantum probes, even for flat spacetime. \r\n\r\nRefs:\r\n[1] Hari K and Dawood Kothawala, Phys.

The PVDF films incorporate both the ð›¼ and êžµ  crystal phases, with the proportion of these phases varying based on the drying temperature during film preparation. This leads to an anisotropic distribution of the two phases within the PVDF film. The ð›¼-phase is found to have a stronger affinity for the organic vapour stimulus (acetone) compared to the êžµ-phase, resulting in differential swelling of the film. In this work, films prepared at varying temperatures are analysed, with the fastest response time observed being less than 0.5 seconds. Interestingly, the response behaviour to the stimuli exhibits a non-monotonic trend as the fraction of the êžµ-phase increases. Due to the delicate nature and rapid responsiveness of the PVDF films, computational modelling is necessary to study the actuation behaviour. By leveraging the similarity between the governing equations of vapour diffusion and heat transfer, the built-in coupled temperature-displacement model was utilised to mimic the actuation, with user-defined subroutines to tailor the dynamic boundary condition of the acetone stimulus. The simulation results are found to be in good agreement with the experimental observations. Finally, we investigated the tuning of geometrical and material inhomogeneity, such as patterning, to achieve intricate shape morphism in PVDF films.

This phenomenon is common in industries like avionics, automotive, and mobile communications, where electronic equipment is regularly exposed to cyclical thermal stresses. The impact of thermal cycling can negatively affect the performance and reliability of electronic components. To counteract these effects and maintain consistent operation, designers utilize specific materials and engineering techniques.\r\nDuring cyclic thermal loading, there is a recurring transition between heating and cooling phases. Initially, the heat sink absorbs heat until it reaches a specified temperature. This is followed by a phase with no heat input, allowing the heat sink to release some of the stored heat. Batteries operating at higher C-rates (discharge rates) demonstrate similar heat generation patterns to those seen in cyclic thermal loads on heat sinks. The primary objective of thermal management is to extend operating time while minimizing temperature fluctuations.\r\nPhase change materials (PCMs) have been successfully employed for thermal regulation using passive cooling methods. However, their low thermal conductivity can limit the effectiveness of thermal management systems. To overcome this limitation, materials that enhance thermal conductivity are combined with the PCM, creating a composite PCM.\r\nIn this context, the integration of composite phase change materials into pin fin heat sinks and batteries has been investigated to extend operating time and reduce thermal fluctuations.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps:// meet.google.com/gqj-rtas-wjw','','',1,'2024-08-27 10:09:36','Active'),(1159,'','Symposium',NULL,'Renewable Energy Technologies - Energizing the Future',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Invitation to the 2nd international symposium on \\\"Renewable Energy Technologies - Energizing the Future\\\" on 28th August 2024in ED102, Kalam Hall, Dept.

Dumping the pollutant directly into water sources is a major environmental concern because Cr(VI) is carcinogenic, highly toxic, and can enter the food chain. The permissible limit of chromium in drinking water is 0.05 mg/L, beyond which, if consumed, may cause cancer, organ damage, or other life-threatening problems. Several methods are available to treat chromium-contaminated wastewater, like adsorption, chemical precipitation, ion exchange separation, membrane filtration, electrocoagulation, and electrochemical processes. Among all techniques, the electrochemical remediation of Cr(VI) has received significant attention due to ease of operation, no chemical requirement, and no residual contamination. \r\n\r\nCarbon derived from biomass is among the promising materials for electrochemical reduction, which is explored in different forms in this study. Moreover, biomass derived carbon acts as a suitable adsorbent, trapping chromium from the water matrix. A low-cost but efficient composite generated from water hyacinth biomass is explored for its contribution to the electrochemical reduction of Cr(VI). The combination of water hyacinth carbon, catalysts, and additives showed increased reduction efficacy due to simultaneous adsorption and electrochemical reduction. This work offers a facile method for complete Cr(VI) removal and proposes a reduction mechanism that helps in cell design for large-scale applications.\r\n','K P Geetha','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet: https://meet.google.com/key-xzdi-aab','','',1,'2024-08-28 03:41:11','Active'),(1161,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\"Investigation of Kinetic and Mechanistic Aspects of Criegee intermediate (CH2OO) and OH radical Reactions with trace Atmospheric Gasesâ€','Ms. Sulfath N (CY21D049)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Rajakumar B, DC Chairperson- Prof. Kothandaraman R, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/09/02 15:00','2024-09-02','yes','CB-310, Chemistry Seminar Hall','Criegee intermediates or carbonyl oxides are tropospheric oxidants, formed during the ozonolysis of alkenes in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, play important role in the formation of organic acids and aerosols.

Gas hydrates, with their low carbon\r\nfootprint and high energy density, emerge as a promising alternate unconventional energy\r\nresource. Despite their abundance, large-scale extraction of gas is not widely implemented\r\ndue to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the efficient extraction strategies.\r\nAmong various hydrate dissociation techniques, such as depressurization, thermal injection,\r\nchemical injection, and their combination, CH 4 -CO 2 replacement is advantageous as it aligns\r\nwith the concept of â€œNet Zeroâ€, by simultaneously allowing extraction of CH 4 and deposition\r\nof CO 2. However, the dissociation of hydrates degrades the mechanical characteristics of the\r\nreservoir, causing several marine geological hazards like submarine landslides, seabed\r\nsubsidence, and borehole collapse. Thus, understanding the mechanical behaviour of hydrate-\r\nbearing sediments (HBS) during dissociation is crucial. The current study aims to\r\nexperimentally comprehend the mechanical characteristics of HBS during dissociation using\r\ndifferent techniques with a primary focus on CH 4 -CO 2 replacement. Further, to replicate the\r\nin-situ loading conditions, especially during the installation of injection and production wells,\r\nas well as during the injection of gas or chemicals for dissociation, the stress-deformation\r\ncharacteristics of HBS will be assessed under slow unload-reload cycles across both small\r\nand large strain regimes.

The test results will further be analysed to understand the effect of different\r\ndissociation techniques on the stress-strain, stiffness, volumetric deformation, and dilatancy\r\nbehavior. These experimental findings will be used to calibrate constitutive models for HBS,\r\nenabling accurate prediction of model responses under various reservoir conditions. By\r\nperforming extensive investigations, the study aims to improve the understanding of the\r\nmechanics of HBS, which will contribute to developing more effective and sustainable\r\nmethods for gas hydrate extraction by sequestering CO2.','Manikandan.

Water scarcity is a multifaceted challenge affecting millions of people worldwide. Atmospheric water is a sustainable source of fresh water. Atmospheric water harvesting has the huge potential to address the water scarcity faced worldwide. Water harvesting methods are primarily condensation-based or adsorption-based1. Sorption-based harvesting is a viable cost and energy efficient method to extract water. There is a need to develop new adsorbents with high sorption capacities, chemical stability to water, tailorable wettability and adjustable pore sizes to optimize the sorption kinetics2. Another major challenge is most water sources are increasingly polluted due to indiscriminate domestic and industrial wastewater discharge. Groundwater is affected by both natural and anthropogenic pollutants, with multiple contaminants like heavy metals entering the water bodies through inadequately treated wastewater. It is crucial to develop advanced materials for the adsorptive removal of heavy metals ensuring clean water for all3. This seminar will provide an overview of advanced materials for water harvesting and purification. I will discuss about the biopolymer-based composites for heavy metal removal and sorption-based humidity harvesting. \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n(1)	Tu, Y.; Wang, R.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, J.

The size conï¬nement, closely packed electronic energy levels, and associated electronic nature lead to numerous applications in the ï¬elds of luminescence, sensors, catalysis, bioimaging, etc.2 Understanding the properties of nanoclusters depends on the determination of their atomic structures through single-crystal X-ray diï¬€raction (SC-XRD) analysis. Crystallographic methods have been the most widely used in nanoclusters for the determination of their structures. While X-ray crystallography has been extremely successful but a major limiting factor in X-ray crystallography is the requirement for large and well-ordered crystals. Because of this, there has been a drive to develop new methods and equipment to determine high-resolution structures from crystals that are many orders of magnitude smaller than what has been conventionally used. Micro-electron diffraction, or MicroED, is a structure determination method that uses a cryo electron microscope to collect electron diffraction data from nanocrystals.3 This technique has been successfully used to determine the high-resolution structures of many targets from crystals with orders of magnitude smaller than what is needed for X-ray diffraction experiment. This seminar will highlight recent advancements in synthesizing heterometal-doped coinage metal NCs and their structure determination through SCXRD and MicroED.

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) outperform in all sectors, as mentioned previously. The scarcity of lithium resources leads to the search for an alternative technology to combat the cost of lithium. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are the best choice for addressing this issue. Still, sodium-ion batteries lack well-performing electrodes. Sodium-layered oxide cathode materials have many problems, such as low cyclic stability and sensitivity to moisture and air. Different strategies are followed in the literature to increase structural stability and reduce moisture/air sensitivity. The strategy followed here is multi-metal doping; in this work, both electrochemically active and inactive elements are doped in the structure. Na0.67MnO2 (NMO) cathode suffers from low cyclic stability due to Mn dissolution and Mn3+ Jahn Teller effect. To improve the cyclic stability, 0.5 moles Fe3+ is substituted in the Mn sites. To further enhance the stability of the Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.5O2 (NMFO), 0.25 moles of Fe is replaced with Co. The prepared compound has shown better electrochemical performance than NMO and NMFO layered cathode materials. In addition, ab initio calculations are carried out using density functional theory (DFT), a tool to reveal the structure, magnetic and electronic properties of parent phase Na0.67MnO2 and Fe/Co-doped systems. Also, the well-performing final compound Na0.67Mn0.5Fe0.25Co0.25O2 (NMFCO) is prepared using different chemical routes, such as conventional and microwave-assisted sol-gel wet chemical processes. Despite improved electrochemical performance, high-cost Co in the structure has to be replaced with low-cost elements.\r\nTo further cut down the cost of the cathode materials, relatively low-cost Ni is doped in the layered oxide cathodes. In addition, the influence of sodium-ion concentration, dopants, electrolytes, and calcination temperature on the electrochemical performance of the NaxMn0.63Ni0.23Fe0.13O2 is studied. Apart from sodium-ion concentration and electrolyte effect on the electrochemical performance of the NaxMn0.63Ni0.23Fe0.13O2, the influence of electrochemically inactive Magnesium (Mg) is also studied in the present work. Hard carbon has been chosen as a low-cost anode in the present study, as graphite is not suitable for SIBs. Graphite is unsuitable for SIBs due to the unstable formation of sodium binary compounds with carbon, such as NaC6 and NaC8. Hard carbon (non-graphitizable and disordered carbon) is a low-cost alternative to graphite. Hard carbon has been prepared from synthetic sources such as glucose, fructose, etc. To further cut down the cost of batteries. Hard carbon anode has been prepared from bio-waste sources such as shells of ground and coconut, etc. Bio-waste sources are attractive because of their microstructure and abundance. Bio-waste-derived anodes are known for their higher specific capacities. The major impediment to the commercialization of hard carbon anode is its low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE). In the present work, the ICE of green peas pod (GPP) derived anode has been improved using pyrolysis temperature as a key parameter. The local graphitization, nanopore nature and specific surface areas have been optimized to obtain higher ICE values.','MME OFFICE 2','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/gxo-zdts-adg','','',1,'2024-08-29 09:43:08','Active'),(1174,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Implementation of Credible Incentive Equilibrium Strategies in Static Network Games ','Mr. Aaditya Kumar (EE21D411)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. Puduru Viswanadha Reddy','Electrical Engineering','2024/09/06 14:00','2024-09-06','yes','ESB234 (Malaviya)','Network games are increasingly used to model and analyze multi-agent decision problems, where each individual\'s objectives depend not only on their own actions but also on the actions of their neighbors within an interaction network. Applications of network games include distributed control of smart grids, congestion control in transport networks, cyber-physical security, and opinion formation in social networks. The Nash equilibrium is the most widely studied solution concept for non-cooperative games. However, when a Nash equilibrium is realized, agents with conflicting interests may not act in a way that maximizes the overall welfare of the network. Moreover, reaching a Nash equilibrium relies on the challenging assumption of common knowledge of rationality. In scenarios characterized by bounded rationality, agents form models of their opponents based on limited beliefs and react accordingly. This motivates the use of a different solution concept to achieve desirable social outcomes in network games. Consistent Conjectural Variations Equilibrium (CCVE) offers a non-cooperative solution framework by identifying equilibrium strategies within the space of reaction functions, which are strategies that incentivize desired outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis work investigates achieving desired outcomes in static network games through credible incentive equilibrium strategies as a CCVE. We focus on two main questions: first, which desired outcomes can be implemented using incentive strategies as an equilibrium? Second, what are the characterizations of the incentive functions that can implement a desired outcome? In the existing literature, these notions are explored for 2-player games. We extend the notions of incentive equilibrium and credibility to network games, where players interact over a connected graph. Credibility conditions ensure agents use incentive strategies when neighbors deviate from the agreed outcome. Assuming payoff functions that are concave in the agentâ€™s actions, we restrict incentive strategies to be continuous and piecewise affine functions satisfying a consistency condition. We show that the conditions for the existence of credible incentive equilibrium strategies involve solving two convex optimization problems. In particular, we reformulate these existence conditions in terms of the feasibility of a system of lower-dimensional linear inequalities and a point in a polyhedral cone. Finally, we illustrate our results with numerical examples.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-30 03:36:30','Active'),(1175,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\" Synthesis, Characterization and Supercapacitor Studies on Spinel-based High Entropy Oxides \".','Mr. N SREENIVASULU (MM16D005)','Phd Scholar, Dept of MME.','Guide: Dr. S.S.Bhattacharya  MME.','Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering','2024/09/12 15:00','2024-09-12','yes','Seminar Hall (NAC 222), 2nd floor, KCB block, MME Department.','A new class of ceramics, referred to as Entropy Stabilized Oxides (ESOs), High Entropy Oxides (HEOs), Equimolar Multicomponent Metal Oxides (EMMOs), compositionally complex oxides, or polycation oxides, has recently attracted considerable research attention across various fields. In these systems, a phase-pure product can be realized despite a high degree of chemical inhomogeneity arising from the presence of a multiple number cations in equiatomic proportions in a single sublattice of the crystal structure. This multi-component approach has opened up new avenues for materials design and discovery, and there remains much to be explored regarding the combination of properties and potential applications.\r\n\r\nIn this work, various compositions of nanocrystalline spinel-based high entropy oxides S-HEOs (with a generic notation of AxB3-xO4; A, B = Al, Cr, Co, Fe, Ni, and Mn) containing at least four or more different elements in equiatomic amounts were synthesised. These individual cations were selected using certain criteria that related to Paulingâ€™s ionic radii rule for substitution in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites. Three bottom-up approaches, namely reverse co-precipitation (RCP), nebulised spray pyrolysis (NSP), and flame spray pyrolysis (FSP), were used to synthesise these oxides with varying levels of residence times. Structural characterization of the synthesized S-HEOs was carried out by various techniques. Finally, functional characterization of the phase-pure S-HEOs as electrode material for supercapacitor applications was carried out. It was found that among the S-HEO compositions, (Al0.2Co0.2Cr0.2Mn0.2Ni0.2)3O4 and (Al0.2Cr0.2Fe0.2Mn0.2Ni0.2)3O4 exhibited better specific capacitance and the results will be discussed in the seminar.','MME OFFICE 2','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','Keywords:  High entropy oxide, Spinel, Phase stability, Reverse co-precipitation, Flame spray pyroly','','',1,'2024-08-30 03:52:40','Active'),(1176,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Vertical extent of hydraulic fractures: insights from theory & experiments','Prof. Brice Lecampion','Professor Brice Lecampion is the head of the Geo-Energy Lab â€“ Gaznat chair at Ecole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland.

Under both normal and strike-slip stress regimes, they propagate vertically and their vertical extent is of prime importance in numerous cases (the presence of upper aquifers or the possibility of eruption are just two examples). In-situ stress & properties contrast between rock formations have been long recognized as the primary causes for their vertical containment at depth. In this talk, I will investigate additional effects. First, I will discuss the impact of the transverse isotropy of rocks on hydraulic fracturing growth combining theoretical modeling and laboratory experiments. Homogeneous transverse isotropic properties promote vertical containment, but such a containment is function of the ratio between the energies dissipated in fluid viscous flow versus fracture surfaces creation. In a second part, I will clarify the importance of the buoyancy contrast between the solid and fracturing fluid on the propagation of three-dimensional hydraulic fractures in a homogeneous material. How material properties and in-situ stress contrast can stop the vertical growth of an otherwise self-buoyant hydraulic fracture will then be illustrated in the light of fully coupled numerical simulations.

We focus on speeches as a mode of central bank communication. In our second study, we analyse how speech sentiment impacts the volatility of the precious metal market. Precious metals work as safe-haven assets and are used for hedging. Hence, a change in the outlook of the economy and inflation conveyed by the central bank through speeches can impact the demand for these assets and thus impact volatility. We calculate the sentiment of the speech using a lexicon-based dictionary method, which also accounts for the valence shifter words. We have used the Bloomberg Precious Metal Index (BCOMPOR Index) as the measure of Precious Metal prices, the BCOMGC Index as a measure of Gold prices and the BCOMSI Index for silver prices, respectively. We employ an OLS-based event study method to understand the impact of the speech sentiment on the precious metal market volatility on the day of the speech and the next day. Our sample comprises speeches from the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England (BoE), and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The ECB and BoE speeches significantly impact the volatility of the precious metal index, Gold and Silver. We do not find a pronounced impact of RBIâ€™s sentiment on the precious metals market volatility. We incorporate additional macroeconomic and financial variables in the model for robustness, and the results remain significant.\r\n\r\nIn our third study, we analyse how the inflationary stance conveyed by the central bank impacts the volatility and jumps associated with the energy stocks in the case of the European Union and the United Kingdom. We consider the speeches and calculate the Dove Hawk Index- a measure of the inflationary stance conveyed by the central bank. We have considered the Financial Times Stock Exchange Energy Index for the United Kingdom and the Energy Index for the European Union. The GARCH with Jump intensity approach is used to analyse the volatility of energy stock prices and to measure their reactions to anticipated and unanticipated policy news. Moreover, we assess whether central bank communications exert differential impacts on changes in energy stock prices under various time horizons. Focusing on the European Union and the UK energy stocks, the paper finds evidence of a time-varying market responsiveness. For instance, a more hawkish stance is associated with an increase in the energy stock price jumps for the EU in the short- and medium-terms, whereas it only holds for the UK in the short run. We find that the exchange rate channel is an important part of the monetary policy transmission mechanism for the energy market. Our research has policy implications for financial market participants and central bankers.\r\nKeywords : Central Bank Communication, Monetary Policy, Central Banking, Text Analytics, NLP, Inflationary Stance, Dove Hawk Index, Precious Metals Market, Gold Volatility, Silver Volatility, Energy Stock Market','HSS OFFICE','hsoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/ivm-ypxn-opy','','',1,'2024-08-30 09:02:12','Active'),(1178,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Detection of inhomogeneities in viscoelastic bodies with application to breast cancer: pressure distribution measurements and predictions','Mr. Narasimha Rao, ME14D084','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering','Guide Names: Prof. Kavitha Arunachalam and Prof. Parag Ravindran,  DC Members: Prof. Narasimhan Swaminathan, Prof. Ratnakumar Annabattula, Prof.  A .

The problem with conducting such screening camps lies in the absence of screening techniques and devices that are portable, affordable, and simple to operate. Mechanical imaging is an emerging technique that holds promise for breast cancer screening applications. Despite the potential, a better understanding of its accuracy and suitability is required, to use it as a screening technique for breast cancer.\r\n \r\nIn Seminar I, development and characterization of polyacrylamide-based phantoms was presented. Also a constitutive model for use with these materials was developed. In seminar II, results from experimental studies on pressure distribution due to lumped masses in cylindrical geometry will be presented. An experimental setup with tactile pressure sensors was used to perform the experiments. Further, the results of finite element simulations, based on previously presented constitutive equation, on different geometries (cylindrical and breast phantom) will be presented. The FE results are also compared to experimental results. Cylindrical and breast fat phantoms with  10, 15, and 20 mm sized malignant lump masses placed at different locations in the specimens were studied. Clear stress peaks corresponding to the lumped masses were obtained, thus highlighting the methodâ€™s potential for breast cancer detection. The findings of this study may be further explored in order to develop a portable and affordable breast cancer screening device.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-08-30 10:04:08','Active'),(1179,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Computational modeling of brain functional dynamics','Dr. Parul Verma','Parul Verma is an Assistant Professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India.

Transitioning from fossil fuels to greener energy sources like hydrogen is necessary for sustainable future. Producing hydrogen through electrolysis and photocatalytic/photoelectrochemical water splitting are promising alternative greener pathways. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotube arrays (TNTs) are widely recognized as efficient photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. In this study, TNTs have been grown on 1.2 mm thick Ti-Al-V (Titanium -Aluminium-Vanadium) alloy sheet by anodization, followed by annealing in different atmospheres - nitrogen (N2), ammonia (NH3), and air. The impact of annealing environment on the structure of TNTs has been examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). The photoelectrochemical performance of the TNTs has been examined by measuring the photocurrent and photostability. Annealing in nitrogen atmosphere significantly improved these parameters. Specifically, samples annealed in nitrogen exhibited a photocurrent density of 157 ÂµA/cmÂ², which is notably higher than the values 78.7 ÂµA/cmÂ² and 40.5 ÂµA/cmÂ² observed for samples annealed in ammonia and air, respectively. This enhancement is attributed to nitrogen doping during annealing, which seems to be responsible for the reduction of electron-hole recombination and thus improving charge separation.

This includes monitoring bulk fluid flows in both open channels and closed pipes. Flow sensors are utilized in pipes of varying sizes, from the micro-scale (nm or Î¼m) to the macro-scale (mm or m). However, most existing flow sensors exhibit diminished performance in detecting low flow rates in macro-scale applications. Additionally, they are typically unidirectional and often come with high costs. For instance, residential water management and irrigation sectors require reliable, cost-effective sensors for flow measurement.\r\n\r\nThis research reported in the thesis began by investigating the feasibility of cantilever-based flow sensors for large-diameter pipes using a camera-based technique. In this approach, a stainless steel cantilever is introduced into the pipe at a 90-degree angle to the water flow, allowing it to bend in response to the flow rate. The bending angle, which indicates both the flow rate and direction, is measured using a camera. Building on this, the research proposed two novel non-intrusive sensing mechanisms to make the cantilever-based flow sensor more practical for real-world applications. These mechanisms eliminate the need for a camera or any pipe openings, using capacitive and inductive sensing methods, which are commonly applied in position detection. Finite-element analysis was employed to optimize the sensor design. A prototype sensor and measurement setup were constructed and tested in the laboratory. The sensor, designed for a flow rate range of 0-7 mÂ³/hr, demonstrated an accuracy of 3%.\r\nThe proposed sensor offers significant advantages over existing flow monitoring systems, including reduced complexity, lower maintenance requirements, the ability to detect flow direction, and adaptability to a range of flow rates. The detailed findings and a comparison with existing sensors will be presented in the talk.','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkONLINE: meet.google.com/hfx-mjgj-bys','seminar01-09-2024 05:08','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar01-09-2024 05:08',1,'2024-09-01 05:08:15','Active'),(1182,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Core-shell nanostructures for piezo-photocatalytic applications','Jhansi Kokkiligadda (MM20D752)','Regular PhD scholar.

Without proper treatment, these dyes pose significant hazards to both the environment and public health. Photocatalytic degradation, utilizing solar energy and cost-effective catalysts, is emerging as a promising technology for treating organic effluents. Our study explores the combination of silver nanowires (Ag NWs) and bismuth ferrite nanoparticles (BFO NPs) to develop core-shell nanostructures for advanced piezo-photocatalytic applications. BFO, a multiferroic material, was synthesized using a sol-gel method with various chelating agents, with tartaric acid (TA) emerging as the most effective. The resulting BFO-TA NPs exhibited superior properties, including a particle size of 20.8 nm, a surface area of 24.8 mÂ²/g, and an optical bandgap of 1.95 eV. These NPs demonstrated weak ferromagnetism at room temperature, making them suitable for magnetic recovery in photocatalysis. The Ag NWs, synthesized via the polyol method, were optimized for high aspect ratios to enhance their optoelectronic properties. The core-shell configuration of Ag NWs with BFO NPs leverages the unique properties of both materials, which offers enhanced degradation of organic pollutants. Initial degradation studies with BFO NPs across various pH levels showed that cationic dyes degraded more efficiently in basic conditions, while anionic dyes responded better in acidic environments. The synthesized nanostructures\r\nnot only demonstrated excellent photocatalytic efficiency but also retained high magnetic recoverability, enabling their reuse. This research paves a way for the development of multifunctional materials for environmental cleanup, utilising the high conductivity and excellent electron transport properties of Ag NWs to enhance photocatalytic efficiency. By combining these advantages with the unique ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of BFO NPs, the resulting core-shell nanostructures offer a versatile and effective system for the degradation of organic pollutants.','Parasuraman Swaminathan','swamnthn@iitm.ac.in','Offline seminar.

The\r\nnumber of transistors that can be concomitantly active inside a processor is limited by\r\nthe inability of the cooling solutions to take away heat. Consequently, the upper bound\r\nof computing performance is inherently determined by the efficiency of the cooling\r\nsolutions. Two-phase immersion cooling has emerged as a promising solution in this\r\ncontext, particularly for high-performance computing applications. However, the poor\r\nthermal conductivity of the dielectric fluids and the effect of non-condensable gases in\r\nthe system impede the efficiency of the two-phase immersion-cooled system. To address\r\nthese challenges, a multi-fluid system approach is proposed. In this configuration, two\r\nimmiscible fluids are used: a denser, lower boiling point fluid for direct immersion of\r\nheat-generating processors and a lighter fluid with higher thermal conductivity where the\r\nvapours of the boiling fluid condense. These fluids are arranged in series without a solid\r\ninterface separating them. Due to significant differences in density, polarity, and volatility,\r\nthe boiling and condensing fluids remain immiscible, forming a distinct separation within\r\nthe system, ensuring the efficiency of the system. The effect of condensing fluid in the\r\nsystem is efficacious in improving heat transfer and coolant condensation with negligible\r\neffect of non-condensable gases. The experimental investigations reveal that multi-fluid\r\nsystems demonstrate superior cooling performance compared to single-fluid systems,\r\nwith an average increase of 33.3% in the overall heat transfer coefficient.\r\nTransitioning to the next phase of thermal management, the focus shifts to ensuring\r\nreliable operations in data centre applications. This requires the development of a practical\r\nand proactive control framework for immersion cooling systems, which necessitates the\r\nprediction of the server temperature. While deep learning-based temperature prediction\r\nmodels have shown effectiveness, further enhancement is needed to improve their\r\nprediction accuracy. In this context, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks\r\nbased on recursive encoder-decoder architecture and attention mechanisms have been\r\nexplored to improve forecasting accuracy and prediction horizon. The training data for\r\nthe proposed deep learning models are collected through in-house experiments using a\r\ntwo-phase immersion cooling system developed in the laboratory. The training data set\r\ncontains real-world data centre traces like traffic bursts, long-running tasks, short-lived\r\nthermal spikes, and stress-testing scenarios. The experiments are semi-automated by\r\nusing the LabVIEW programming to interface the data acquisition unit and the power\r\nsource. A comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the model and its sensitivity\r\nto factors like sampling periods, window size and noise in the training data are explored\r\nin this work. Encoder-decoder LSTM models are found to be 14% more effective than\r\nvanilla LSTM models, while attention-based models further enhance performance by an\r\naverage of 19% on a dataset collected from a Raspberry Pi module.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','Two-phase immersion cooling; Multi fluid two-phase immersion cooling; Data centre thermal management','','',1,'2024-09-02 02:47:07','Active'),(1184,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','RESPONSE CONTROL OF A TENSION LEG PLATFORM USING PASSIVE DAMPER','Ms. Suja T P, OE20D003','Ms. Suja T P, OE20D003, Ph.

Nanomaterials are a distinct class of materials with a large specific surface area that display unique thermal, electrical, and optical properties that differ from their bulk counterparts.[1] These unique properties help us to design novel materials useful for many applications such as sensors, filters, absorbers, and metamaterials. In this talk, two specific applications, EMI shielding and electrodes for secondary batteries, are targeted by developing conducting nanocomposites.\r\nSilver nanowires (AgNWs) have high electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility and so these nanowires are very useful in the development of flexible smart devices. AgNWs can be used either alone or mixed with other nanomaterials to form composites depending on the nature of applications. In our research work, AgNWs were used to design and develop novel materials for EMI shielding. \r\nThe high-aspect AgNWs, synthesized using a simple and scalable chemical reduction method, were vacuum filter coated on an eco-friendly nitrocellulose paper. The ultrathin (~0.69 Âµm) coated composite paper showed an ultrahigh EMI SE of 69.4 dB, which blocked 99.99999% of microwaves.[2]  \r\nBy reducing the thickness of the AgNW film, it is possible to develop an optically transparent conducting coating that can effectively block electromagnetic radiation. A 38 nm spin-coated AgNW thin film, with visible transparency of over 80%, exhibited a high EMI SE of 20 dB (99% blockage) which surpasses industrial standards.[3] \r\nTo introduce the component of electromagnetic absorption by multiple reflections, AgNWs were coated with a thin magnetic material (Ni) using a one-step chemical reduction method. Depending on the concentration of AgNWs, two different morphological features with varying coefficients of absorption had been fabricated.[4] These high absorption-based materials can be used in defence and aerospace industries.\r\nTo fulfill the rising demand for large-scale energy storage devices, potassium ion batteries (KIB) are forecasted to play a critical role in replacing lithium-ion batteries (LIB). Shifting our focus on eco-friendly materials, we synthesized high-purity carbon from bio-wastes such as tender coconut shells. Low specific area enabled tender coconut shell-derived hard carbon (THC) showed a high capacity of 389 mAhg-1 at the current density of 30 mAg-1. Moreover, the potassium ion half-cell cycled at a higher specific current density of 200 mAg-1 retained 98.3% original capacity after 100 cycles.[5]\r\nIn this seminar, a brief introduction about nanomaterials, their properties relevant to each application, the significance of each application, key results, and mechanisms will be discussed.\r\nReferences\r\n[1]	C.N.R.

ISM is not homogeneous rather it varies in density and temperature. The chemical and physical processes that occur in different portions of heterogeneous interstellar medium are responsible for formation and depletion of ISM molecules. Among these processes is ion-neutral reactions. Due to strong attractive force between ion and permanent or induced dipole on the neutral, many ion- neutral reactions proceed at a large rate at room temperature and below that. The rates of these reactions are critical towards the abundance of different species in ISM. We have built a 22-pole radiofrequency (RF) ion trap set-up in our lab with the motive to study ion-neutral reactions akin to the ISM environment. Trapping of both positive (SF5+) and negative (SF6-) ions has been done for about a few seconds [2]. Different factors affecting trapping efficiency were also analyzed. The 22-pole rf ion trap setup was employed to investigate dissociative photoionization of benzonitrile and ion-neutral reactions between benzonitrile and its photo-fragments. We recorded the temporal evolution of product ions resulting from ion-neutral reactions between benzonitrile and its photo-fragments. The results show new molecular mass growth pathways that were previously not observed. In another experiment, we studied the stability of styrene molecules through multiphoton dissociative ionization. We observe a predominant parent cation and a very weak yield of benzene cation, which shows retention of the carbon skeleton in styrene followed by photoionization. The observations also indicate the position of conical intersection lies below than the previous experimental estimate and theoretically computed value. Moreover, we report the first experimental observation of metastable AlFâˆ’ ion. We measured a peculiar high electron affinity, i.e. 2.53eV, as compared to the low binding energy of excess electron in previously measured metastable negative ions. The results indicate good agreement with theoretical calculations, suggesting the AlF- is formed in 2Î  state.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\r\n[1]      C.

The interdependency between sub-problems makes the original problem complex. The Travelling Thief Problem (TTP), an exemplary representation of such a multi-component optimization problem, is introduced in the literature with keen academic interest. TTP, a combination of the Travelling Salesman Problem and the Knapsack Problem, has drawn much attention over the past few years. Several variants of TTP have also been developed and studied extensively in recent years. With the evolution of logistics and supply chains, TTP is finding more relevance in real-world applications. The literature around TTP has been increasing consistently. This growing research interest motivates us to present a systematic overview of the existing literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to provide a systematic literature review on TTP. Hence, our first objective is to present a survey of literature on TTP and their associated operations. The study analyses 68 articles and comprehensively covers TTP variants (i.e., mono and bi-objective TTP, multiple TTP). Subsequently, state-of-the-art TTP solution methodologies are reviewed and classified into exact, heuristic, meta-heuristic, and hyper-heuristic methods. Finally, research gaps and future research opportunities are delineated for TTP. The future research scope shows that the Multiple Travelling Thieves Problem (MTTP) remains unexplored. Moreover, the two-echelon network in logistics was introduced to find efficient ways to distribute or collect consignments or cargo from one point to another. However, the concept of two-echelon is yet to be employed in the context of TTP. Therefore, our second objective is to propose an extension of MTTP named Two Echelon Multiple TTP with Multiple Drop Nodes (2E-MTTPMDN).

Dual scale global and local porous medium models have been developed and reported in this work, to study the effects of airside congestion on the blood oxygen content in the alveolar region of the human lung. \r\nThe human lung is modelled as a global, equivalent, heterogeneous porous medium comprising three zones with distinct permeabilities related to their progressively complex branching structure. Airflow for each breathing cycle is determined by solving mass and momentum transfer equations across the three porous medium zones. The congestion is introduced by appropriate modification of the porous medium properties of the zones considered. The congestion affected air velocity reaching zone3 is given as input to a separate local model employed at several locations of the alveoli of zone3. The local model determines the oxygen content in the blood flow in the capillaries of the alveoli by solving suitable mass, momentum and species transport equations. \r\nThe transient simulation results performed for a long duration of multiple breathing cycles, demonstrate that a normal, healthy human lung is functional for up to 40 percentage volume congestion or when 50 percentage of the lung is congested to about 23.5 percentage. Increasing congestion beyond this value, quickly  within a few hours  depletes the oxygen exchange in the blood flow of the alveolar region of zone 3 leading to hypoxemia.\r\nThe effects of congestion progression on oxygen exchange dynamics determined through the dual scale porous medium modelling approach provide researchers and medical professionals in silico predictive estimates to generate treatment strategies for chronic respiratory diseases.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/dya-tpxk-rvo','','',1,'2024-09-03 13:28:39','Active'),(1194,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','Toward on-demand measurements of greenhouse gas emissions using aerial robotic systems','Prof. Javier GonzÃ¡lez-Rocha','Prof. Javier GonzÃ¡lez-Rocha is an Assistant Professor in the Applied Mathematics Department at UC Santa Cruz.

Generally, BODIPYs have long-wavelength emissions due to a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap. Thus, when conjugated with other organic chromophores/fluorophores, fluorescence is often observed from the charge transfer state. Electron-donating groups like carbazole have been shown to alter the photophysical properties of the BODIPY core[2]. These molecules generally form a donor-acceptor system where the carbazole or TPA units act as donors and BODIPYs as acceptors. Due to strong intramolecular charge transfer characteristics, these systems are expected to display higher environment sensitivity than a typical BODIPY molecule. Although there are several reports on donor-acceptor-based BODIPY systems, the photophysics of these molecules has not been investigated in greater detail. \r\nThus, our objective is to carry out detailed photophysics of donor-acceptor-based BODIPYs and their applications in various biological systems. Our initial work is focused on the comparative study of the photophysics of two molecules, N-butylcarbazole BODIPY (CBZ-BDP) and N-butylcarbazole bis-BODIPY (CBZ-bisBDP)[3]. We have also conducted studies on the application potential of the two dyes in various organized media and biological systems[4]. In the present work, we investigate the photophysics of a set of meso-substituted dithiophene BODIPY conjugates (BD4-7) with the specific objective of doing a comparative study. The applicability of the molecules as sensing and imaging tools is also explored. The investigations suggest their remarkable and versatile photophysical properties and their sensitivity towards polarity, microviscosity, and temperature. The studies also show their ability in bio-imaging applications. \r\nReferences:\r\n1. A. Loudet, K. Burgess, Chem. Rev. 107 (2007) 4891â€“4932.\r\n2. D. Zhang, Y. Wang, Y. Xiao, S. Qian, X.

These cylindrical structures undergo vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) due to strong ocean currents. The vortices are generated during fluid flow, resulting in high vibrations in cross-flow and in-flow directions, which can cause severe damage to platforms, cables, and riser systems. Therefore, it is critical to mitigate the VIV caused by the vortex-induced forces. This study compares the hydrodynamic performance of a bare cylinder with that of geometrically modified cylinders with continuous helical strake (HS) and helical discrete strake (HDS). The HS is a conventional type, where the strakes are continuous all along the length of the cylinder whereas the HDS is discontinuous. The cylinders\' hydrodynamic performance in terms of lift and drag force coefficients are computed using a RANS-based CFD solver and validated with the measurements conducted on cylinders without and with strakes.  The drag and lift force coefficients for the HDS cylinder with four different segment spacings between the fins are considered.  The investigations are carried out for four different Reynolds numbers(Re), ranging from 4000-10000.  The hydrodynamic performance of a cylinder with HDS of one particular spacing is observed to be performing better than that of a cylinder with continuous helical strakes.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-05 03:44:56','Active'),(1201,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Vibration Signal De-noising using VMD and Morlet Wavelet Filter based Methods','Mr. Akshay Rajendra Patil, Roll No.: ME18S049','MS Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','\r\n\r\n\r\nGuide: Dr. Piyush Shakya, ME / GTC Members List: (i) Prof. Abhijit Sarkar, ME (ii) Prof. A.

Sudden bearing failure may lead to catastrophic machine failure. Early bearing fault detection is essential to avoid machine failure. Vibration data received from bearings typically contain impulsive fault information. The characteristics acquired from the vibration signals generated by bearings are primarily used to identify bearing defects. The derived features might not be able to accurately pinpoint the failure\'s timing due to background noise in the observed vibration signal. External noise reduction from the vibration signal is essential for extracting important features for effective fault diagnosis. A helpful de-noising method at present is Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD). However, the VMD method alone may not eliminate the noise from the vibration data. The present work proposes a methodology for noise reduction combining VMD and an optimized Morlet filter. Initially, the signal is split using the VMD approach into various Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF), and the most efficient IMF is chosen using the maximum kurtosis criterion. Next, the Golden Ratio Optimization Method (GROM) based Morlet wavelet filter is applied to the effective IMF for reducing unwanted noise. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technique is then employed to identify the bearing defects. The proposed approach is tested upon bearing simulation datasets, bearing experimental datasets, gearbox experimental datasets, and sound datasets to validate its efficiency. The validation of the proposed algorithm using gear and sound datasets indicates its broad applicability.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/qpa-eben-ith','','',1,'2024-09-05 04:07:30','Active'),(1202,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Molecular insights into the effect of temperature gradient on electrically charged fluids at nanoscale','Mr. Kiran Prakash (AM16D027)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Applied Mechanics & Biomedical Engineering','Guide: Prof. Sarith P Sathian','Department of Applied Mechanics & Biomedical Engineering','2024/09/12 15:00','2024-09-12','yes','Online Meeting Link: https://meet.google.com/zta-ctsw-kbv','Electrohydrodynamics and ion transport phenomena in conducting and dielectric fluids\r\nhave received intense attention from the scientific community over the last few years.\r\nElectrokinetics(EK) is a field of study that deals with the transport and manipulation of fluids by\r\napplying electric fields. EK uses electrical charges to manipulate and control the flow of fluids in\r\nmicro- and nanoscale systems. An understanding of the electrical double layer (EDL) is\r\nfundamental to the use of electrokinetic effects. The broad spectrum of physical effects, in\r\nconjunction with the fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interface interactions and non-uniformities of the\r\nbulk properties, significantly impact the flow in narrow channels. However, electrokinetic flows are\r\ntypically analyzed under the assumption of isothermal conditions, even though achieving such\r\nconditions in practice can be challenging.

Persistent infection with High-Risk Human Papillomavirus (HR-HPV) genotypes, particularly HPV16 and HPV18, is recognized as the primary cause of the disease, responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. The widespread adoption of population-based screening, including cytology (Papanicolaou test) and HPV testing, has been associated with significant decreases in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. However, current screening methods, particularly polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques for HPV detection, are time-consuming and require expensive instruments, limiting their accessibility in resource-constrained settings. There is a need for rapid, cost-effective, and sensitive cervical cancer screening methods that can facilitate early detection, thereby reducing the incidence and mortality of the disease and providing more effective treatment options. We aim to develop a cost-effective and highly sensitive paper-based microfluidic device for the rapid detection of HR-HPV DNA. This platform leverages the simplicity and affordability of paper microfluidics to deliver an accessible and practical screening solution, particularly suited for low-resource settings. Also, several cofactors are known to influence the onset and progression of cervical disease, either by promoting or preventing HPV infection. Among these, the heterogeneity of the cervico-vaginal microbiota plays a crucial role. This community of commensal microorganisms contributes to immune protection, regulates inflammatory processes, and is involved in the onset of precancerous lesions in the cervical epithelium. Despite extensive research on the interplay between microbiota, and cervical tumors, many aspects remain unexplored. To address this, we will develop a microfluidic organ-on-chip model to mimic in vivo disease conditions. This platform will enable the study of cellular interactions during cervical cancer progression and help identify novel therapeutic targets, advancing our understanding and treatment of the disease.\r\n \r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-05 05:18:06','Active'),(1205,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- திருத்தம் (Thiruttham)\r\nHindi word	- संशोधन (Sanshodhan)\r\nEnglish word	- Amendment','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-09-05 05:34:04','default_value'),(1206,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Climate Change, Groundwater Irrigation and Water Use Efficiency: An Empirical Study in India','Ms. Aryama Sarkar (HS21D004)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Dept of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras.','Dr. Sabuj Kumar Mandal (Guide), Dept of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras.','Department of Humanities and Social Sciences','2024/09/12 16:00','2024-09-12','yes','Google meet','Rapidly changing global climate poses a significant threat to global agricultural production. While groundwater irrigation can reduce the adverse effects of climate change in the short run, over-extraction of groundwater may lead to severe water scarcity in the long run. This calls for an immediate improvement in efficiency of groundwater use for irrigation. Furthermore, as a common pool resource, groundwater lacks proper price signaling, inducing farmers for over-extraction. Against this backdrop, this study aims to analyze the role of irrigation in reducing the negative impacts of climate change on agricultural production, while considering irrigation demand as a function of groundwater recharge rate. By utilizing climatic data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and socio-economic information from ICRISAT-VDSA Meso Data (2000-2011), this study finds that with complete irrigation coverage, an additional 10 extreme degree days reduces yield by 11% for wheat and 5% for rice â€“ as opposed to 14% for wheat and 6% for rice in the absence of irrigation. However, the excessive use of groundwater resources exacerbates water scarcity. Within this context, there are conflicting hypotheses regarding the relationship between water scarcity and water use efficiency, but the true nature of this relationship remains unclear. Therefore, the second objective of this study is to empirically elucidate this connection. We employ Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate groundwater use efficiency for irrigation across 287 districts in India from 2011 to 2017. The districts are categorised into four groups based on water scarcity, following the classification by Katyaini and Barua (2015). Our findings indicate that farmers in water-scarce regions are less efficient in groundwater use than those in water-abundant areas. On the face of erratic rainfall, farmers often diversify into less water intensive crops. Therefore, this study intends to examine how diversification of crops can lead to more efficient usage of groundwater for irrigation. Subsidized electricity for the agricultural sector is another driving factor for over-extraction of groundwater, which calls for withdrawal of such subsidy. However, this may result in farmersâ€™ protest as they may consider this subsidy as their endowment. This leads to difficulty in implementing such policy. Therefore, we would like to examine the presence of farmers\' endowment effect for free electricity by reallocating the subsidy through experimental design. Fifthly, using primary survey data, the study aims to explore farmers\' cooperative behavior to determine whether they adhere to Kantian social norms or Nashian norms. The study also aims to validate the hypothesis in existing literature that socially optimal allocation of resources through Kantian optimization is Pareto optimal, whereas Nashian equilibria are not. \r\nThe study concludes with appropriate policy recommendations for efficient groundwater utilization. \r\n\r\n','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/otu-mqot-oqj','','',1,'2024-09-05 07:37:58','Active'),(1207,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Exploring Molecular Interactions and Material Properties for Sustainable Energy Solutions',' Dr Vallabh Vasudevan','Dr. Vallabh Vasudevan joins us as a postdoctoral fellow, he joins us after finishing his PhD at the materials science and engineering department at Monash University, Australia.\r\n\r\nAnakin Bahm joins us as an undergraduate researcher.','Postdoctoral fellow, University of Michigan.','Department of Chemical Engineering','2024/09/10 14:00','2024-09-10','yes','MSB241','Renewable energy and energy consumption efficiency stand as the â€œtwin pillarsâ€ of a sustainable energy economy.

The nature of these professions, where a momentary lapse in diligence may determine the difference between life and death, demands constant digital connectedness facilitated by increasingly pervasive Information and Communication Technologies. The resultant Professional Digital Intrusion (PDI) causes WF imbalances. Drawing from the Job-Demands Resources theory, this study posits that PDI is a job demand that depletes the job resources of these personnel, leading to Work Family Interferences (WFI). Research has established that WFI severely affects employees\' psychological well-being, job satisfaction, and organizational productivity. Although extensive research on WF literature exists, the CPG context provides a unique backdrop for this study. In India specifically, there is almost no empirical evidence on the WFI experience of CPG personnel. These organizations are crucial for developing the national economy, law and order, health, and international security and prestige. Given the impact of these organizations on these critical realms, it becomes essential to focus research attention on creating a strong workforce by devising preventative actions against the WFI of personnel. This study posits that the solution to combat WFI for CPG personnel lies in preventing resource depletion by combining external and internal job resources. Past research has established Perceived Organizational Support (OS) as an external job resource that reduces employees\' WFI. This study examines its impact on the WFI of Indian CPG personnel. The efficacy of this external job resource notwithstanding, this study also examines the impact of cognitive reappraisal (CR) on WFI. This psychological process involves reframing the meaning of a stressful situation as an internal resource that could moderate the impacts of PDI and perceived OS on WFI. This study also examines the role of socio-demographic variables as boundary conditions in the predicted relationships. \r\nA cross-sectional survey was conducted on 356 CPG personnel. Covariance-based Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and moderation analyses using Process Macro revealed results to the Research Question (RQ)s. RQ1 investigated the impact of PDI on the WFI faced by CPG personnel. SEM results found a strong positive relationship between PDI and WFI (Î² = 0.403, p < 0.001). RQ 2 investigated the impact of perceived OS on the WFI faced by CPG personnel. A strong negative relationship was found between perceived OS and WFI (Î² = -.551, p < 0.001). RQ3 investigated the impact of CR as a possible moderator in the relationships between the predictor variables PDI and perceived OS on the criterion variable WFI in CPG personnel. SEM results showed no direct significant effect on WFI (Î² = -.016, p > 0.05), however CR, in interaction with PDI, significantly decreased FWC of personnel (p = .001). RQ4 investigated the possible moderating role of socio-demographic variables in the relationships between the predictor variables PDI and perceived OS and the criterion variable WFI in CPG personnel. Interaction analyses with PDI revealed that the HC sector suffered from significantly higher WFC (p=.0034) and FWC (p=.007). The interaction of age with PDI revealed an interesting association with FWC, with the mid-seniority group (35-45 years) demonstrating the highest FWC (p=.03) and the seniormost group (>45 years) demonstrating the least FWC (p=.008). Education interacted with PDI to make the higher educated group (postgraduates or above) significantly more susceptible to WFC (p=.0001) and FWC (p=.0240). Passive OS significantly decreased FWC in higher-educated personnel (p=.0084). In response to RQ5, this study makes recommendations for practical and sustainable interventions at the organizational and individual levels that can reduce CPG personnel\'s WFI in alignment with SDGs 8 and 16. This study advances our theoretical understanding of how and when PDI and perceived OS predict WFI, and the psychological and emotional mechanisms and boundary conditions underlying these processes. The findings have direct managerial and policy implications, which are discussed. This particular field of inquiry has immense growth potential and this study offers relevant future research directions, potentially shaping how we understand and address WF balance in CPGs\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-06 07:07:42','Active'),(1209,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','ACCELERATED AGEING STUDIES ON BALLISTIC PROPERTIES OF PROPELLANTS','Mr. Veerandra Yadav Karri (AE17D025)','Ph.D scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering.','Dr. Ramakrishna P A - Guide\r\nDr. Murthy H S N - Co-guide','Department of Aerospace Engineering','2024/09/09 11:30','2024-09-09','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/yur-sjbc-frz','','',1,'2024-09-06 08:46:15','Active'),(1210,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\'\'LEADING WITH COMPASSION: A STUDY ON THE COMPASSIONATE LEADERSHIP OF SCHOOL PRINCIPALS AND ITS INFLUENCE ON TEACHER WORK ATTITUDES AND PERFORMANCE\'\'.','Mr. RICHARD MARCEL I, ROLL NO.

This added stress to school teachers, who needed compassionate leadership to navigate the crisis. Despite the growing evidence on the importance of compassionate leadership, there is limited research on how it influences teachers\' work attitudes and job performance during such challenging times. This study addresses this gap by examining how school principals\' compassionate leadership affects teachers\' resilience, work engagement, psychological well-being, and job performance, particularly during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on theories of trust, positive emotions, and self-efficacy, the study proposes a model where compassionate leadership enhances teachers\' self-efficacy and positive emotions, which in trun mediate the relationship between leadership and teacher outcomes. The role of teachers\' trust in their principals is also investigated as a moderating factor. Data from 496 school teachers in Tamil Nadu, India, were analyzed using descriptive statistics, regression, and correlation techniques. The findings confirm that compassionate leadership positively influences teacher outcomes, with self-efficacy and positive emotions serving as mediators. Additionally, the effectiveness of compassionate leadership is moderated by the level of trust teachers have in their principals. These results highlight the crucial role of compassionate leadership in supporting teachers during crises and suggest that school principals should prioritize developing compassionate leadership skills. The study also offers future research directions and implications for organizational leaders in general and educational leaders in particular.

Job crafting offers a promising method that can potentially drive sustainable and long-term improvement to employee engagement. Although originally conceptualized as actions initiated by employees to shape their jobs so as to derive more meaning from work, recent research has shown that job crafting interventions can be an effective tool for organizations and managers can enable job crafting among employees. However, no research exists on the effectiveness of job crafting interventions among knowledge workers, specifically Indian knowledge workers, who now form a significant part of the global workforce.\r\n \r\n\r\nA job crafting intervention was designed and delivered to knowledge workers, employed with Indian multi-national organizations, to assess the extent to which such interventions can enable job crafting behavior, that translates into work engagement. An important aspect of the study is the use of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to understand and explain how job crafting behavior leads to enhanced work engagement, which is another gap in research â€“ lack of theoretical rigor that explains why job crafting leads to work engagement. A quasi-experimental research design with no control group was used to deliver four interventions, and all the results provided support for the effectiveness of job crafting interventions in stimulating job crafting behavior, and consequently, work engagement. However, the ability of need satisfaction under SDT to explain how job crafting leads to work engagement was limited, and requires further research.\r\n ','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-08 06:37:57','Active'),(1215,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Feedback Stackelberg-Nash equilibria in quasi-hierarchical difference games with inequality constraints ','Mr. Partha Sarathi Mohapatra (EE18D703)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Dr. Puduru Viswanadha Reddy ','Electrical Engineering','2024/09/19 14:00','2024-09-19','yes','ESB 244','Dynamic game theory (DGT) provides a mathematical framework for analyzing multi-agent decision processes evolving over time. DGT has been applied effectively in engineering, management science, and economics, where dynamic multi-agent decision problems naturally arise. Notable engineering applications include cyber-physical systems, communication networks, and smart grids. Most existing DGT models are formulated in unconstrained settings. However, real-world multi-agent decisions often involve constraints, such as saturation limits, bandwidth restrictions, production capacities, budgets, and emission limits. These factors introduce equality and inequality constraints into the dynamic game model, linking each player\'s decisions to the others at every stage. As a result, players\' decision sets are interdependent, or coupled.\r\n\r\nIn Seminar 1, we considered a class of linear-quadratic difference games with coupled affine inequality constraints. We presented both necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of generalized open-loop Nash equilibria for this class of games.\r\n\r\nIn this seminar, we study a class of two-player deterministic finite-horizon difference games with coupled inequality constraints, where both players have two types of decision variables. In one type, players interact sequentially; in the other, they interact simultaneously. We refer to this class of games as quasi-hierarchical dynamic games and define a solution concept called feedback Stackelberg-Nash (FSN) equilibrium. Under the separability assumption of the cost functions, we provide a recursive formulation of the FSN solutions using dynamic programming. Furthermore, the FSN solution for this class of constrained games is obtained using the parametric feedback Stackelberg solution of an associated unconstrained parametric game, which involves only sequential interactions, with a specific choice of parameters that satisfy certain implicit complementarity conditions. For the linear-quadratic case, we demonstrate that the FSN solutions can be obtained by reformulating these implicit complementarity conditions as a single large-scale linear-complementarity problem. Finally, we illustrate our results using a dynamic duopoly game with production constraints.

Generally, the size of these solid particles is small and so these may be assumed to be of spherical shape for analysing the flow situations in above-mentioned applications. These solid particles encounter many interactions in the above-discussed applications, viz. particle-particle, particle-fluid and particle-wall. The particles may rotate about any one of their axes as a result of these interactions. However, Torobin and Gauvin (1965) observed that these interactions mainly induce rotation about an axis perpendicular (transverse axis) to the flow direction. The rotation of particles significantly modifies their wake characteristics and hydrodynamic forces, which are directly connected to the pumping power and heat transfer associated with these applications. Therefore, many researchers performed experimental and numerical studies on flow over spheres with or without rotation placed in various orientations to examine the effect of flow on wake and dynamic characteristics of the particles. In the present work, three-dimensional numerical computations are performed on flow over two transversely rotating inline spheres using OpenFoam to understand the various particle interactions. All the computations are performed for a fixed Reynolds number of 300. Spheres are rotated in both co and counter directions to consider the effect of sense of rotation of spheres. Both the spheres are rotated with equal angular velocity, which takes the values between 0 and 1. The non-dimensional spacing between both the spheres has been varied from 0.25 to 3. Iso-Q surfaces and streamlines have been utilized to examine the effect of rotation and spacing on the wake characteristics of both the spheres. Hilber Huang transform has been performed on the time signals of lift coefficients of both spheres to examine the variation of wake nonlinearity with spacing and rotation. Variation of Strouhal number, separation angle, drag and lift forces with spacing and rotation of spheres also determined.

DWSI in India face stigma, carnal taboos, and systemic exclusion from economies of desire and sexuality. Their voices are seldom heard, and their stories, when captured, are whitewashed. The researcher, who identifies as a DWSI herself, establishes an urgent need to locate DWSI as a separate political category for issues unique to them. She employs a fresh method she terms â€˜raw narrativesâ€™ to expose tabooed and otherwise censored embodied experiences of DWSI. This paper presents a candid case study using narrative inquiry and autoethnography to examine the raw narrative of one DWSI in India in the light of the researcherâ€™s insiderâ€“outsider perspectives tempered with reflexivity. Carol Thomasâ€™ â€˜impairment effectsâ€™ and Margrit Shildrickâ€™s â€˜embodied precarityâ€™ are used to highlight how impairment effects, coupled with inadequate care infrastructure in India, force DWSI into chronic states of dependency and precarity, leading to internalised loss of self-worth and agency. Wider use of raw narratives as a lens to probe into unspoken elements of human experience and further study of the complexities in the lives of DWSI could enrich feminist disability studies.

One such challenge is the need for robust vision systems that can operate effectively in low-light conditions, which are common in real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these key challenges by focusing on Stereo low-light depth estimation, image enhancement, and novel view synthesis in low-light conditions.\r\n\r\nTo address the first challenge of extreme stereo low-light enhancement and depth estimation, this thesis proposes a comprehensive low-light stereo dataset SSID: Stereo See in the Dark designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of robust stereo vision algorithms under extremely low lighting conditions. Using the proposed dataset, we have developed an approach that leverages enhancement features as cues for estimating disparity in extreme low-light conditions. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art enhancement models using our dataset, demonstrating the critical importance of real images over synthetic ones for effective low-light enhancement. Our experiments further demonstrate that stereo images provide more information compared to single images, leading to superior enhancement results.\r\nOur dataset unlocks new opportunities in the field of stereo low-light enhancement and disparity estimation, which could significantly benefit applications such as autonomous driving and VR/AR.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we present â€œGAURA: Generalizable Approach for Unified Restoration and Rendering of Arbitrary Viewsâ€ to address the challenges of novel view synthesis in low-light conditions. GAURA can achieve near-photorealistic image synthesis of scenes from posed input images when the images are imperfect, e.g., captured in very low-light conditions where state-of-the-art methods fail to reconstruct high-quality 3D scenes. GAURA is a generalizable neural rendering method that can perform high-fidelity novel view synthesis in low-light conditions and can generalize to several degradations. Our method is learning-based and does not require any test-time scene-specific optimization. It is trained on a synthetic dataset that includes several degradation types. GAURA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks for low-light enhancement, dehazing, deraining, and on-par for motion deblurring. Further, our model can be efficiently fine-tuned to any new incoming degradation using minimal data. We thus demonstrate adaptation results on two unseen degradations, desnowing and removing defocus blur.\r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/msh-jsij-zbc','','',1,'2024-09-10 10:30:45','Active'),(1226,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF ZINC ION BATTERY THROUGH LASER ASSISTED ENGINEERING METHODS',' Mr. Manikandan M, ED22D021','Ph.D. Scholar, Department of engineering Design','Dr. Deepak Ronanki ( Chair & Member )\r\n \r\nDr. Nilesh J Vasa ( Guide)\r\n \r\nDr. Sivarama Krishnan (Co-Guide)\r\n \r\nDr. Kavitha Arunachalam (Member)\r\n \r\nDr. Samuel G L, ME (Member)','Engineering Design Department','2024/09/11 18:00','2024-09-11','','Google Meet joining info Video call link: https://meet.google.com/mhz-xffs-qzy','Given the impacts of climate change and the dwindling supply of fossil fuels, there is an urgent\r\nneed to transition to renewable energy sources. The efficiency of these renewable energy systems\r\nhinges significantly on effective energy storage mechanisms. Currently, most energy storage\r\nsolutions rely on lithium, which presents several limitations, including scarcity, high costs, and\r\nsafety concerns. To overcome these challenges, researchers are exploring alternative storage\r\nsystems that are more cost-effective and safer. One promising option is zinc-based energy storage,\r\nwhich uses aqueous electrolytes and offers improved safety.\r\nHowever, zinc-based systems face a significant drawback: a shorter cycle life caused by dendrite\r\nformation. This issue is primarily due to uneven current density on the anode surface, the presence\r\nof a passivation layer, and hydrogen evolution reactions. Our research aims to mitigate dendrite\r\nformation by achieving a more uniform local current density on the anode. This will be\r\naccomplished through several strategies: a) laser texturing with various laser source (nanosecond,\r\nfemtosecond, and picosecond lasers), b) laser shock peening of the anode, and c) incorporating\r\nbio-carbonaceous materials onto the anode surface.\r\nThe study will investigate the impact of different laser parameters and operating environments\r\n(such as air and argon) on the electrochemical properties of the anode. There is limited research\r\non laser shock peening effects on the electrochemical behavior of zinc. Additionally, the influence\r\nof bio-carbonaceous materials on battery cycle life will be explored. Full cell assemblies will be\r\nprepared, and comprehensive electrochemical testing will be conducted to evaluate cycle life,\r\ncoulombic efficiency, and capacity retention.','EDOffice','edoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-11 04:42:16','Active'),(1227,'','Learn Hindi Word',NULL,'Improve Your Vocabulary',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Tamil word	- அடிப்படைக்கல்வி  (Adippadai-kalvi)  \r\nHindi word	- बुनियादी शिक्षा (Buniyaadi shikshaa) \r\nEnglish word	- Basic Education','हिंदी कक्ष / प्रशासन Hindi Cell / Admn. आईआईटी मद्रास/IIT Madras ','hindicell@iitm.ac.in','',NULL,NULL,0,'2024-09-11 05:00:37','default_value'),(1228,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Interpreting adversarial attacks and defenses using architectures with enhanced interpretability','Mr. Akshay G Rao, Roll No: CS21S002','MS Research Scholar','Dr. Sutanu Chakraborti - GTC Chair, Dr. Arun Rajkumar - Guide, Dr. Chandrashekar Lakshminarayanan - Co-Guide, GTC Members: Dr. Harish Guruprasad - CSE, Dr. Lakshmi Narasimhan Theagarajan - EEE.','Department of Computer Science and Engineering','2024/09/25 15:00','2024-09-25','','MR - I (SSB 233, First Floor)','Adversarial attacks in deep learning represent a significant threat to the integrity and reliability of machine learning models.

One of the most important ones being that sample preparation is relatively simple, compared to other forms of spectroscopy. It  is possible to develop affordable and  compact systems, which when used with in-built data processing, can yield results quickly.   Diffuse spectroscopy can be used when samples are available in granular or powder form, which makes this an ideal technique for analyzing coffee. This beverage is  widely consumed in India, and requires regular scrutiny for adulteration. While there are many different adulterants used with coffee, a common one is chicory. In India, chicory is often also used as an acceptable addition both for its flavor and lower cost. In that case, the percentage of chicory needs to be verified. This poses a significant challenge for quality assurance. This study presents the design and development of an in-house diffuse reflection collection optical system for NIR spectroscopy, aimed at simplifying the analysis of powdered samples with minimal sample preparation. The system was designed using Ansys Zemax software, incorporating off-axis parabolic mirrors and other off-the-shelf optical components to collect the maximum diffuse reflection. The performance of the assembled system was compared to that of the modeled system, and shown to behave as designed. Coffee samples with varying amounts of chicory were studied in both the built system, as well as using a commercial DR instrument. DR spectra contain the fingerprint information, moisture content, and variation in particle size. The collected complex spectra were analyzed using the multivariate calibration methods like principal component analysis and partial least squares regression. The developed optical system is found to be  efficient and the current model can predict the amount of chicory with an accuracy of 5%  for chicory addition up to 20%. Interestingly, the accuracy  and repeatability is also good for values above 35% chicory, but not in the intermediate range.','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-11 09:20:38','Active'),(1232,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','CE6999 Seminar - Influence of Natural Coir Geotextiles on the Failure Characteristics of Weak Subgrade','Mr. Nitish Kumar, Roll No. CE20D204','Ph.D Research Scholar','Dr. Ramesh Kannan K - Guide, Dr. Thyagaraj T - DC Member, Dr. Surender Singh - DC Member, Dr. Prashant Rawat (AE) - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head','Civil Engineering','2024/09/13 15:30','2024-09-13','yes','BSB 104, Conference Room','Geo-reinforcement is one of the most important utilities whose primary function is to enhance the strength of soil specifically engineered for the construction of geo-structures. Utilizing polymer-based geosynthetic reinforcement for various applications in pavements has been successfully used for the past few decades. However, with the growing awareness towards the environment and climate change, there is a constant lookout for energy-efficient and sustainable reinforcing materials for road construction (specifically for low-volume rural roads). Natural coir fibres can be considered as an alternative which are entirely sustainable, eco-friendly, and cost-effective. Woven coir geotextiles, in particular, have garnered attention for enhancing the load-bearing capacity of subgrade and maintaining acceptable settlement limits when used in pavement. Nevertheless, coir fibres also has few inherent drawbacks, such as its hydrophilic nature, relatively lower tensile strength & stiffness compared to synthetic fibres, and non-uniform geometrical characteristics leading to improper bonding/ interaction with the surrounding geomaterials. Therefore, it is crucial to consider these limitations to optimize the use of coir fibres as reinforcement in various applications.\r\nThe current study focuses on improving the strength and durability of coir geotextiles in addition to quantifying their interaction behavior and load-bearing characteristics when used as reinforcement within the soil. Soil-reinforcement interaction behaviour and shear mobilization at the interface are dependent on several factors, including material characteristics, boundary constraints, and applied loads. Through a combination of experimental and numerical methods, this study investigates the soil-coir geotextile interaction under pullout loading conditions to understand the factors governing pullout resistance and the associated mechanisms. Additionally, the improvement in the load-bearing capacity of the reinforced soil mass and the corresponding load dispersion angle will be quantified by placing the reinforcement at an optimal depth within a model test tank. Furthermore, alternate techniques such as pre-tensioning of the coir geotextiles and its impact on the stress-deformation characteristics of the reinforced soil mass under static and cyclic conditions will be explored. Finally, a suitable chemical and physical treatment technique will be used to enhance the characteristics of coir fibres which can mitigate the inherent surface defects of the coir fibres and improve their strength and durability.\r\n','R.

Hence, heuristics and metaheuristics have been widely used to address such problems in extant literature. However, such heuristic and metaheuristic procedures typically do not provide any information on how close the objective value of a given solution is to the optimum. This highlights the need for developing techniques and procedures that allow rapid determination of bounds on the optimum for large-scale problems. Considering a theoretical model of a permutation flow shop with a total flow time minimization objective, we explore a multitude of approaches designed to enhance the speed and accuracy of computing lower bounds.  These approaches include extensions of an existing polynomial-time job-based lower bounding algorithm, and a novel iterative Self-Tuning Lower Bound Algorithm (STLBA), where the original problem is approximated by a simpler model that is progressively tightened to provide a good lower bound. We also highlight how the STLBA circumvents certain limitations that are encountered while using linear programming relaxations and Lagrangian duality for determination of lower bounds in permutation flow shops. We then extend these bounding approaches for dealing with large-scale problems of practical interest, such as optimization of a two-echelon truck-drone delivery routing problem with order selection decisions. This problem considers a fleet of trucks and drones, which are coordinated for efficiently handling deliveries. Trucks transport goods to local hubs or drone stations, where drones then handle the last-mile delivery to specific customers. The challenge includes not only optimizing the routes and schedules for both trucks and drones but also making real-time decisions about which orders to accept and how to prioritize pickups and deliveries.  By integrating our theoretical approaches, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of how to improve the efficiency of lower bound determination in large-scale scheduling and logistics problems. We believe our methods offer a balance between computational efficiency and solution quality, paving the way for more effective decision-making in complex operational environments.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','RESEARCH PROPOSAL SEMINAR-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-11 14:05:53','Active'),(1235,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Decentralised and Invariant Resource Allocation Policies for Multiple Access Channels ','Mr. Prashant N (EE18D202) ','Ph.D Scholar Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. Lakshmi Narasimhan ','Electrical Engineering','2024/09/18 11:00','2024-09-18','yes','ESB 244','In wireless communications, the fading multiple access channel (MAC) serves as a model for systems in which multiple users transmit information over fading channels to a single receiver. Our research focuses on exploring optimal power allocation policies to maximize the sum rate for non-cooperative users with individual transmit power constraints for various MAC wireless systems. This optimization of power allocation for various wireless systems may be a non-convex problem. We provide an alternating maximization algorithm to compute near-optimal policies for non-convex problems and optimal policies for convex problems.\r\n \r\nIn this system, a phenomenon, that we refer to as invariance, is observed when the number of transmitting users in the system is sufficiently large. Under invariance, the optimal power allocation policy of a user becomes independent of the other users. This enables decentralized computation of optimal power allocation strategies. Further, when new users get added to the system or a few current users drop out of the system, re-computation of the optimal power allocation scheme would not be required under invariance. We analyze this invariance phenomenon and provide conditions under which invariance occurs. We also derive the optimal power allocation strategy under invariance. The power allocation policies thus derived are shown to achieve the global maxima of the sum-rate optimization problems.\r\n \r\nWe perform the above analysis for the following MAC models.\r\n1)  Indoor Optical Wireless MAC: The indoor optical wireless MAC has multiple mobile users communicating using infrared to an access point. The wireless optical channel is non-negative real-valued and the exact capacity of it is not known. We use a tight lower bound on the sum rate to formulate the power allocation optimization problem with per-user average and peak transmit power constraints. This optimization problem turns out to be non-convex. Here, the conditions under which invariance occurs and the invariant power allocation policy are derived.\r\n \r\n2) Gaussian MAC: This MAC is the standard model of RF wireless communication systems. A non-convex power allocation optimization problem is formulated using the Gaussian sum-rate expression with per-user average power constraint. The conditions for the existence of invariance are derived. Further, we show that, under certain conditions, the invariant power allocation strategy is a greedy policy.\r\n\r\n3) Generalized Gaussian (GG) MAC: In contrast to previous MAC models where the additive noise follows a Gaussian distribution, the GG-MAC has additive noise that follows the generalized Gaussian distribution. The GG distribution can accurately model the additive noise in multiple systems such as ultrawide numbers and RF communications, acoustic communications, etc. First, we derive a tight lower bound on the capacity of this system and its sum rate with per-user average and peak transmit power constraints. Next, we formulate a convex power allocation problem using a lower bound on the sum rate. Finally, as before, we obtain the conditions for the existence of invariance and show that the greedy policy is the invariant power allocation strategy when there are sufficiently large numbers of users in the system.

The growing popularity of digital libraries as a medium for dissemination of scientific knowledge and discoveries has provided easy access to voluminous amounts of research articles, editorials, systematic reviews, and other relevant scientific discoveries. However, researchers face the challenge of efficiently navigating overwhelming amounts of information. This often constitutes the problem of information overload and retrieving information relevant to oneâ€™s requirement becomes a daunting and cumbersome task. This research investigates novel strategies aimed at enhancing this knowledge discovery process in digital libraries through the lens of scientometric methods. The thesis begins by establishing the foundational principles of scientific inquiry, emphasizing the necessity of rigorous methodologies and systematic exploration of literature. Scientometric approaches are then introduced as powerful tools for analyzing and extracting insights from scholarly data.\r\n\r\nThe first study in this research strives to develop a comprehensive framework for bibliometric analysis that efficiently integrates sophisticated techniques from network analysis and natural language processing to conduct analysis. This framework enables researchers to conduct a comprehensive review of literature and extract meaningful insights from large bibliographic databases. The framework also provides more freedom to researchers by reducing the dependency on software for analysis and allows the utilization of programming tools that offer higher computational power and scalability. The study then applies the proposed framework on a real-world dataset of literature surrounding COVID-19 to draw meaningful insights. The bibliometric study serves as providing a suitable starting point to researchers looking to start investigations in a field and guide their research objectives.\r\n\r\nThe second study in this thesis focuses on the development of a recommendation algorithm that prioritizes article quality, semantic relatedness, and community structure to offer accurate and scalable recommendations. By a judicious incorporation of these factors, the algorithm aims to suggest relevant articles in an accurate and scalable fashion. The proposed algorithm is empirically evaluated on four large scale databases and its efficacy is tested against state of the art metrics. The results indicate an improved accuracy and scalability of the proposed approach. The recommendation algorithm thus empowers researchers to make informed decisions about which articles to prioritize in the literature review process.\r\n\r\nThe third and final objective in this research explores the phenomenon of delayed recognition in literature. These papers, called â€œsleeping beautiesâ€ are often overlooked in the years following their publications before suddenly gaining a surge in citations and attention from the academic community. Through an empirical study, a novel method to identify sleeping beauties is proposed. Further, the papers experiencing delayed recognition are characterized and through case studies, reasons for delayed recognition are explored.\r\n\r\nOverall, this research contributes to the advancement of knowledge discovery processess in digital libraries by proposing relevant and effective methodologies grounded in scientometric principles. Through these approaches, researchers can efficiently navigate the vast sea of publications and make meaningful contributions to their field of study.

However, genuine inclusion of individuals of all genders in the workplace remains elusive, with many organizations struggling to foster environments where all employees feel a sense of belonging. While leadership roles, policies, and structures have been prioritized, a notable gap exists in understanding and assessing the competencies required for gender inclusiveness. We define GGIC as the ability of individuals to develop a sense of belonging and value to promote inclusivity for all gender identities i.e., men, women, and transgender individuals.\r\nThis research proposes the development of a Global Gender Inclusion Competence (GGIC) Scale, aimed at conceptualizing, developing, and validating a tool to assess employees\' competence in fostering gender inclusion.

This study will contribute to the field by offering a clear framework for gender inclusion competence and providing organizations with a practical tool to assess and enhance the inclusiveness of their employees, leading to a more equitable and supportive workplace for all.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','RESEARCH PROPOSAL SEMINAR-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-12 06:25:22','Active'),(1238,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Ph.D Seminar Talk - II  - Factors Affecting the Suitability of Coir Fibres in Pavement Quality Concrete','Mr. Md.

However, concrete pavements are prone to early-age cracking (Plastic shrinkage cracking (PSC)). In order to arrest these cracks, synthetic fibres are traditionally used but sustain an additional construction cost. This study explores the suitability of incorporating discarded coir fibers (DCF) as a sustainable material in low-volume rural roads. However, DCF possesses dispersion, workability, and degradation issues in the concrete. Also, because of their intrinsically variable qualities, low density, and hydrophilic nature, the performance of DCF is typically lower than that of synthetic fibers; hence, treatment of the DCF is necessary. Therefore, this study intends to develop a framework for treating mature and immature DCF which could be readily adopted for enhancing the quality of coir fibres. However, the performance of the concrete incorporating these coir fibres may differ from the control concrete. Hence, the present study fundamentally investigates three critical points concerning concrete pavements made with coir fibres viz. dominating parameters of coir affecting the strength, strength reduction mechanism, and degradation mechanisms of coir in concrete. Various parameters such as fibre maturity level (mature and immature), fibre aspect ratio (40 and 200), fibre dosage (0.1-0.7% by volume), fibre treatment (alkaline treatment by NaOH), and concrete grade (M30 and M40) were considered; The results indicated a reasonable performance of the coir concrete under lower dosages which is just sufficient for arresting the PSC. However, when the coir fibre is used in higher dosages, negative effect was observed on coir concreteâ€™s characteristics. Fibre characteristics responsible for the strength reduction of the concrete were mapped in this study. Moreover, degradation studies were performed on the coir fibre to get its in-depth behavior in concrete. Furthermore, hybrid concrete mix incorporating the coir fibres was designed to enhance the overall performance of the fibre concrete.\r\n','R.

Board characteristics may significantly influence investment decisions and may moderate the relationship between ownership and corporate investments. Hence, we analyse if board characteristics moderate the relationship between controlling ownership and corporate investments. Real-option theory suggests that increased economic uncertainty may lead to reduced capital investments. Hence, examining how political factors moderate the relationship between ownership concentration and corporate investments is crucial. As related party transactions (RPTs) are increasing in Indian firms, there are growing concerns about fairness and potential conflicts of interest. The concern with related party transactions involving controlling owners is that they may not be conducted at arm\'s length, which could result in potential conflicts of interest, favouritism, or even abuse of power. Hence, the impact of RPTs on investment sensitivity needs to be examined. Controlling owners as promoters, are subject to various regulatory requirements, including disclosure norms, restrictions on trading during specific periods and compliance with takeover regulations. SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, provides conditions for promoter reclassification. Promoter reclassification could influence market performance, warranting further investigation into its effect on stock price crash risk. Hence, an attempt is made to examine the impact of level of concentrated holding on investment decisions, impact of RPTs on investment sensitivity and impact of promoter reclassification on stock price crash risk.

The growing popularity of digital libraries as a medium for dissemination of scientific knowledge and discoveries has provided easy access to voluminous amounts of research articles, editorials, systematic reviews, and other relevant scientific discoveries. However, researchers face the challenge of efficiently navigating overwhelming amounts of information. This often constitutes the problem of information overload and retrieving information relevant to oneâ€™s requirement becomes a daunting and cumbersome task. This research investigates novel strategies aimed at enhancing this knowledge discovery process in digital libraries through the lens of scientometric methods. The thesis begins by establishing the foundational principles of scientific inquiry, emphasizing the necessity of rigorous methodologies and systematic exploration of literature. Scientometric approaches are then introduced as powerful tools for analyzing and extracting insights from scholarly data.\r\n\r\nThe first study in this research strives to develop a comprehensive framework for bibliometric analysis that efficiently integrates sophisticated techniques from network analysis and natural language processing to conduct analysis. This framework enables researchers to conduct a comprehensive review of literature and extract meaningful insights from large bibliographic databases. The framework also provides more freedom to researchers by reducing the dependency on software for analysis and allows the utilization of programming tools that offer higher computational power and scalability. The study then applies the proposed framework on a real-world dataset of literature surrounding COVID-19 to draw meaningful insights. The bibliometric study serves as providing a suitable starting point to researchers looking to start investigations in a field and guide their research objectives.\r\n\r\nThe second study in this thesis focuses on the development of a recommendation algorithm that prioritizes article quality, semantic relatedness, and community structure to offer accurate and scalable recommendations. By a judicious incorporation of these factors, the algorithm aims to suggest relevant articles in an accurate and scalable fashion. The proposed algorithm is empirically evaluated on four large scale databases and its efficacy is tested against state of the art metrics. The results indicate an improved accuracy and scalability of the proposed approach. The recommendation algorithm thus empowers researchers to make informed decisions about which articles to prioritize in the literature review process.\r\n\r\nThe third and final objective in this research explores the phenomenon of delayed recognition in literature. These papers, called â€œsleeping beautiesâ€ are often overlooked in the years following their publications before suddenly gaining a surge in citations and attention from the academic community. Through an empirical study, a novel method to identify sleeping beauties is proposed. Further, the papers experiencing delayed recognition are characterized and through case studies, reasons for delayed recognition are explored.\r\n\r\nOverall, this research contributes to the advancement of knowledge discovery processess in digital libraries by proposing relevant and effective methodologies grounded in scientometric principles. Through these approaches, researchers can efficiently navigate the vast sea of publications and make meaningful contributions to their field of study.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-12 08:49:49','Active'),(1241,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Seawater desalination by roto-dynamic crossflow RO system.','Mr. Nitikesh Prakash (AM18D205)','PhD Scholar | Department of Applied Mechanics & Biomedical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Abhijit Chaudhuri | Co-Guide: Dr. Shyama Prasad Das (ME)','Department of Applied Mechanics & Biomedical Engineering','2024/09/26 14:00','2024-09-26','yes','Online Meeting Link:https://meet.google.com/ukp-fcuu-nfk','Concentration polarization (CP) and membrane scaling present significant operational challenges in reverse osmosis (RO) systems, especially in the desalination of brackish and seawater. These phenomena reduce the membrane efficiency and permeate output, increasing energy consumption and operational costs. The present study focuses on addressing these challenges by employing a â€œroto-dynamic RO systemâ€, which integrates a rotating disk over the RO membrane to impart high shear and cross-flow. This design enhances mass transport across the membrane, mitigating CP and substantially improving system performance and permeate production.\r\nA numerical framework has been developed using ANSYS Fluent, coupling the fundamental conservation equations with moment-based population balance models through user-defined functions (UDFs). This numerical framework predicts and analyse the behaviour of gypsum scaling, CP, and turbulent flow over the RO membrane. These simulations can effectively estimate scaling and CP based on feed concentration and key operational conditions such as feed pressure and rotor speed. This analysis is crucial for system optimization, allowing for enhanced performance and longer membrane lifespan. \r\nThe numerical framework also has wide applicability, and can be extended to various RO configurations, including conventional spiral-wound RO (SWRO) membranes, providing valuable insights for operational estimation and optimisation.\r\nThe study further emphasizes the effect of turbulent flow in enhancing diffusion across the membrane surface, playing a vital role in reducing CP and thereby delaying membrane fouling and scaling. Based on insights from the numerical simulations, a multi-stage roto-dynamic RO system has been designed, showing marked improvements in permeate flux and significant reductions in CP compared to conventional systems.\r\nBy combining these advanced numerical techniques and a novel roto-dynamic system design, this research offers innovative solutions for mitigating CP, hence delaying scaling in RO desalination processes, paving the way for more efficient, durable, and cost-effective RO systems.\r\n','HoD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/ukp-fcuu-nfk','','',1,'2024-09-12 09:30:29','Active'),(1242,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Local and Hyper-Local Multicast Services Transmission in Next-Generation Mobile Networks.','Ms. SINGH SWETA RAJESH SONU (EE16S065)','MS Scholar','Guide: Dr. Giridhar K','Electrical Engineering','2024/09/16 11:00','2024-09-16','yes','ESB-244 (hybrid mode)','The efficiency of the broadcast network is impacted by the types of services transmitted over it. Global services serve users across the entire network, local services target users in specific sub-regions, and hyper-local services have even narrower coverage. Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) is ideal for global service transmission over both Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) and mobile systems, while Local Service Insertion (LSI) schemes in existing Single Frequency Networks (SFNs) deliver both global and local/hyper-local services within DTT networks. Single Cell-Point to Multipoint (SC-PTM) and Multi-Frequency Network (MFN) are used solely for transmitting hyper-local services over mobile and DTT systems, respectively. However, these schemes fall short when network-wide requests for local and hyper-local services arise in mobile networks. SC PTM, which is prone to interference and uses a conventional multicast scheme (CMS) approach for transmitting single-rate hyper-local services, is often deployed in such scenarios, but its cellular design forces local services to be transmitted as hyper-local services.  \r\nIn this talk, we propose a new Local and Hyper-Local Services (LHS) transmission scheme that mitigates the limitations of SC-PTM by transmitting local services with macro-diversity gain and utilizing the multicast group\'s user distribution, Hierarchically Modulated (HM) Non-Uniform Constellations (NUCs), and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) to schedule the service requests in a spectrally efficient way.

Wired chargers are more popular owing to their greater efficiency, ease of design, and control. However, the main concern for adopting EVs is the long idle period for charging. Next-generation EVs come with high voltage (HV) powertrains to enhance the battery charger\'s power rating without increasing the charging cord size. Existing EVs have battery voltages ranging from 250-450 V and are charged through low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) battery chargers. However, these chargers are incompatible with charging HV powertrain vehicles from a universal ac input power source. Thus, different chargers are needed to charge LV/MV/HV powertrain vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe present work proposes modular and reconfigurable onboard and offboard charging topologies with a wide range of output voltage compatibility to charge existing LV/MV battery systems and next-generation EVs. In addition, seamless transition-based control architectures are designed to attain a smooth mode transition over a wide voltage range of operation. The effectiveness of the proposed charger topologies and their control strategies are validated through extensive studies through MATLAB simulations and experimental studies on a scaled-down laboratory prototype. Finally, the critical performance characteristics of the proposed chargers, such as input current THD, operating power factor, device rating, and efficiency, are comprehensively analyzed and compared with the existing charger configurations. Test results and performance assessment indices demonstrate the charger\'s wide voltage range capability from 120-900 V EV charging with flexibility, scalability, and efficiency features.','EDOffice','edoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-13 03:51:16','Active'),(1245,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','OPTICAL BREATH GAS SENSING AND ANALYSIS TO MEASURE ACETONE AND AMMONIA IN HUMAN EXHALE AS BIOMARKERS','Mr. Saran Kumar K, ED19D755','Ph.D. Scholar, Department of Engineering Design','Dr. Tuhin Subhra Santra (Chair & Member)\r\n\r\nDr.  Nilesh J Vasa (Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Satyanarayanan Seshadri AM, (Co-Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Kavitha Arunachalam (Member)\r\n\r\nDr. Balaji Srinivasan , EE','Engineering Design Department','2024/09/13 14:00','2024-09-13','','Google Meet joining info Video call link: https://meet.google.com/nzy-neyb-cdy','Exhaled human breath analysis is a very promising field of research work that have a great potential\r\nfor diagnosis of diseases in a non-invasive way.

We find the work and meditation of Satyagraha as overcoming dualism and non-dual realization in Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and many other Satyagrahis. We can realize this as an Advaita (non-duality) without boundaries which also can be cultivated as a Tantra of cultivation of transformative energies.\r\n\r\nThis paper also strives to relate work and meditation with Truth in Satyagraha to translation and travel. Satyagraha is at work in our everyday lives of translation which is not just a linguistic activity but also involves translation of visions, practices and languages of different dimensions of self such as lower self and higher self in oneself as well as self and other. Our other experiences, practices and visions of translation such as  inter-cultural, inter-ideological and inter-religious translation also have a dimension of Satyagraha as Satyagraha itself is a work and meditation of translation. There is a fundamental relationship between Satyagraha and translation because Satyagraha has been translated differently as passive resistance, active non-violence and Ahimsa by various individuals, social action groups and socio-spiritual and socio-political movements.\r\nSatyagraha is also related to travelâ€”both inner and outerâ€”which helps us go beyond fixed conceptions of self, other and the world. Gandhi, for example, cites many instances of his realizing the depth and grace of Truth during the contingencies, challenges as well as blessings of travel. Thus Satyagraha, which involves manifold sadhana and struggles with Truth, travel and translation, invites us to practice it as part of our everyday life.','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-13 05:36:59','Active'),(1249,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Development of a high sensitivity quantum diamond magnetometer','Mr. PRAVEENA GANAPATI HEGDE, (PH22D041)','PhD Scholar','Guide: Dr. VIDYA PRAVEEN BHALLAMUDI','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/09/18 11:30','2024-09-18','yes','HSB-203, Department of Physics ','\"Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds are emerging as a preferred platform for quantum sensing due to their ability to operate at room temperature, their compact form, high stability, and extended coherence times compared to other solid state sensing platform s.

However, the increased number of users and data streams can create bottlenecks and overheads during the implementation of such systems. This thesis addresses two such implementation issues. The huge amount of data generated at a massive MIMO base station can be cumbersome to handle and process. This can throttle the capacity/speed of the network by creating a bottleneck in the fronthaul link, which connects a massive MIMO Remote Radio Head (RRH) and carries IQ samples to the Baseband Unit (BBU) of the base station. This gives rise to the need for data compression techniques tailored towards massive MIMO signal models, that are scalable to the ever increasing number of antennas and are at the same time also compatible with the hardware limitations of the RRH. In this work, we first focus on devising fronthaul compression techniques for massive MIMO base stations that address the above needs. We use matrix representation as an elegant and convenient way to visualize the orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) signals received at a massive MIMO RRH in the uplink. From this, we develop a low rank baseband signal model and propose two different fronthaul compression techniques. The first technique is based on low rank approximation using the QR decomposition, which offers higher compression ratios than existing methods and is easy to implement on RRH hardware. The second technique is an iterative matrix decomposition method using alternating minimization that utilizes the convolution structure of the received signals. This method offers orders of magnitude higher compression ratios than the QR technique, but at the cost of higher complexity. We analyse the performance of these techniques in terms of their compression ratios, error rates, and computational complexity, and identify the trade-offs between these factors. We evaluate the performance of the matrix decomposition method under different practical scenarios and constraints. The second problem considered in this work is the increased pilot overhead in massive MIMO systems, especially in multi-user scenarios, which wastes spectral resources and decreases the throughput. We explore an almost blind demodulation solution for massive MIMO-OFDM signals that uses the above iterative matrix decomposition technique to provide estimates of the user data as well as the channel using a single pilot, irrespective of the size of the OFDM signal. Finally, we evaluate performance of the matrix decomposition method in terms of its algorithm complexity versus time, for both the compression and blind estimation problems under user mobility conditions, where the instantaneous channels are temporally correlated. We discuss how the underlying temporal correlations in the channel can be utilized to decrease the complexity of the matrix decomposition algorithm by reducing the number of iterations required.\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/ewc-yeog-jmo','','',1,'2024-09-13 06:31:05','Active'),(1251,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Beyond associations: Causal Relation Extraction of various biomedical entities','Nency Bansal, Roll No: CS21D002','Ph.D. Research Scholar','Dr. Sutanu Chakraborti - DC Chair, Dr. Manikandan Narayanan - Guide, \r\nDC Members: Dr. B Ravindran - DA, Dr. Mitesh Khapra - DA, Dr. Michael Gromiha - BT.','Department of Computer Science and Engineering','2024/09/18 11:00','2024-09-18','',' MR-1 (SSB 233, First Floor)','Information on causal relationships is essential to many sciences (including biomedical science, where knowing if a gene-disease relation is causal vs. merely associative can lead to better treatments); and can foster research on causal side-information-based machine learning as well. Automatically extracting causal relations from large text corpora remains less explored though, despite much work on Relation Extraction (RE). The few existing CRE (Causal RE) studies are limited to extracting causality within a sentence or for a particular disease, mainly due to the lack of a diverse benchmark dataset. Here, we carefully curate a new CRE Dataset (CRED) of 3553 (causal and non-causal) gene-disease pairs, spanning 284 diseases and 500 genes, within or across sentences of 267 published abstracts. CRED is assembled in two phases to reduce class imbalance, and its inter-annotator agreement is 89\\%. To assess CREDâ€™s utility in classifying causal vs. non-causal pairs, we compared multiple classifiers and found SVM to perform the best (F1 score 0.70).

The poorest among the Scheduled Tribes (ST) are further denied access to RMNCH services, resulting in much worse health outcomes due to the intersection of their social status and economic position. The present study aims to capture the magnitude of inequalities in healthcare services utilisation and health outcomes among the ST population in two tribal-dominated states of India, Odisha and Jharkhand. The study has five objectives. We use secondary data from the National Family Health Survey in the first four objectives and employ the slope index of inequality, relative concentration index, relative index of inequality, concentration index, and Kakwani index to determine inequalities within the ST population. In the fifth objective, we conducted a primary qualitative study using in-depth interviews and semi-structured group discussions in the Anamalai block of Coimbatore district in the state of Tamil Nadu. \r\nIn the first objective, study results show that the prevalence of undernutrition stood higher among the under-five ST children compared to children belonging to other social groups. Estimating wealth-related inequalities (absolute and relative), the study results present that a higher proportion of stunted and underweight children belonged to the poorest quintile within the ST category in Odisha and Jharkhand. The study also observed a reduction in wealth-related inequalities in undernutrition between 2005 and 2021. In the second objective, we observe that the proportion of ST women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who were overweight and obese was higher in Odisha compared to Jharkhand. In Odisha, absolute inequalities in overweight and obesity increased between 2006 and 2021, though relative inequality declined. Conversely, Jharkhand saw a decline in both absolute and relative wealth-related inequalities in overnutrition over the same period. In the third objective, we observe that utilisation of RMNCH services is higher among women who are better educated and belong to wealthier households. The wealth-related inequalities in the co-coverage indicator and modified Composite Coverage Index (CCI), two summary indices to determine RMNCH utilisation, exhibit an increase in Odisha between NFHS-4 (2015-16) and NFHS-5 (2019-21). In Jharkhand, the wealth- and education-related absolute and relative inequalities present a reduction between 2016 and 2021. In the fourth objective of the study, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of women delivering in government healthcare facilities compared to private centres between NFHS-4 (2015â€“16) and NFHS-5 (2019â€“21). In Odisha, Out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) for public healthcare decreased, while it rose sharply in private facilities. In Jharkhand, OOPE increased in both sectors. In Odisha, public healthcare costs shifted from being progressive in NFHS-4 (2015-16) to regressive in NFHS-5 (2019-21), indicating a higher burden of health spending on lower-income groups. In Jharkhand, OOP in public healthcare remained progressive, but in private healthcare, OOPE was regressive, increasing the financial burden on the poorer population. In the fifth objective, we observed that increased access to health information through outreach initiatives, transparency about available health facilities, changes in cultural practices, improved transportation and regular visits by Village Health Nurses, are the major factors that led to an improvement in the utilisation of maternal health care services by tribal women over the generations, in the studied region. Free services, cash transfer programs, with more supportive health staff have made maternal healthcare more affordable and encouraged tribal women to seek care willingly. \r\n\r\nThe study results underscore the urgency of targeted policies and interventions to address the inequalities in accessing RMNCH services and the resulting health outcomes among ST communities. A multi-dimensional approach that considers the socioeconomic, cultural and geographical factors affecting healthcare should be adopted while formulating health policies to reduce the inequalities in healthcare access and outcomes.\r\n','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/iqb-jiqw-cwq','','',1,'2024-09-13 10:43:41','Active'),(1253,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Fabrication of a novel Interpenetrating Polymer Network hydrogel scaffold using natural biomaterials suitable for bone tissue repair and regeneration','Ms. Dharani Devi R (BT18S350)','MS Scholar','Prof. V Kesavan (BT), Prof. Madhulika Dixit (BT), Prof. Ravikumar N V (MME), Dr. Abhishek Misra (Physics)','Department of Biotechnology','2024/09/18 15:30','2024-09-18','','https://meet.google.com/ymd-jwnq-ksw','Bones, spanning the entire human body, act as a mechanical framework and aid in the movement of the muscles.

Our results show that strong electron correlations on the one-dimensional edges lead to a helical Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, tunable by substrates with varying dielectric constants. Additionally, we demonstrate that the excitonic insulating gap can collapse under doping, consistent with STM experiments. Proximity-induced superconductivity in WTe2-NbSe2 heterostructures reveals an edge-localized, particle-hole symmetric gap formation, highly dependent on edge geometry and interface interaction.

In this work, we identify three critical stages of agriculture where there is considerable scope for improvement of the sustainability aspects. \r\nFirst, we have the production stage, where the eco-friendliness of the prevalent farming methods is a cause of concern. The highly productive conventional farming methods are criticized for their negative environmental and health impacts due to the overuse of synthetic fertilizers and irrigation water. Organic farming methods, which are presumed eco-friendly, suffer from low yields and are not sustainable options for mass production. In this context, the achievement of many SDGs like SDG 3 (good health), SDG 6 (sustainable water management), SDG 12 (responsible production), etc., rely on the development of better agricultural methods that provide the right balance between yield and environmental impacts. We identify the importance of the optimal use of agricultural inputs like fertilizer and irrigation water in achieving this balance and propose a new eco-labeling scheme to drive the stakeholders in this direction. The proposed eco-labeling scheme is then applied to a game theoretic model of an agricultural supply chain consisting of a farmer and a retailer. The analytical results derived help optimize the farm inputs, retail prices, and order quantity so that the stakeholdersâ€™ profits are maximized. We also investigate the effects of yield information sharing in this supply chain and find that the stakeholders must share yield information when environmentally conscious consumers dominate the market.\r\nSecond, the public crop procurement policies in India need to be revamped to eradicate poverty (SDG 1), ensure food security (SDG 2), meet peopleâ€™s nutritional needs (SDG 3), conserve water (SDG 6), reduce inequalities within the country (SDG 10), etc. The improvement of the present Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme that offers an assured price for the crops grown by the farmers is a necessary step in this direction. The major aspects to be addressed in this regard include fair remuneration for the farmers in all yield scenarios and bridging the disparity in income distribution among the farmers in different regions of the country. Alongside the development of a new MSP scheme aimed at farmersâ€™ welfare, we also contributed a two-stage stochastic programming model to aid the government in generating a sustainable plan for crop procurement in a region. A case study of crop procurement in the Bargarh district of Odisha, India, is used to illustrate the proposed approach. The study shows that the procurement plan contributes immensely towards enhancing agricultural sustainability by encouraging crop rotation, assuring crop adequacy in the procurement region, and minimizing the governmentâ€™s procurement costs.\r\nThird, proper management of agro-residues is vital for improving the sustainability of agricultural supply chains. Especially the prevention of harmful practices like stubble burning helps safeguard peoplesâ€™ health (SDG 3) and combat climate change (SDG 13). With the advent of second-generation biorefineries, these agro-residues have become a promising source of renewable energy. So, an effective stubble collection and storage mechanism not only prevents stubble burning in fields but also ensures uninterrupted feedstock supply to the biorefineries. Since these efforts help to increase the share of renewable energy in the world energy mix, efficient feedstock procurement models also contribute to SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy). Hence, we attempt to improve the existing feedstock procurement models by including the neglected factors like baler contracting under uncertain baling time availability and choice of storage under a possibility of storage disruption. Additionally, we introduce a novel idea of distributed procurement that controls the extent of stubble burning across the entire stubble collection region, thereby preventing high pollutant emissions and their adverse health and environmental impacts. A multi-stage stochastic programming approach is employed to aid decision-making, and an illustrative case study of feedstock procurement for a biorefinery in the Bargarh district of Odisha, India, is presented. The case study demonstrates the effectiveness of adequately designed incentive schemes in ensuring distributed procurement.\r\n','DoMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-16 13:30:38','Active'),(1263,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Enumerative combinatorics in the Alternating group $\\AAA_n$ and more','Prof. Sivaramakrishnan Sivasubramanian','Professor Sivaramakrishnan Sivasubramanian is a faculty member in the Department of Mathematics at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay.

Automatically extracting causal relations from large text corpora remains less explored though, despite much work on Relation Extraction (RE). The few existing CRE (Causal RE) studies are limited to extracting causality within a sentence or for a particular disease, mainly due to the lack of a diverse benchmark dataset. \r\n\r\nHere, we carefully curate a new CRE Dataset (CRED) of 3553 (causal and non-causal) gene-disease pairs, spanning 284 diseases and 500 genes, within or across sentences of 267 published abstracts. CRED is assembled in two phases to reduce class imbalance, and its inter-annotator agreement is 89%. To assess CREDâ€™s utility in classifying causal vs. non-causal pairs, we compared multiple classifiers and found SVM trained on embeddings from a deep learning transformer model called BioBERT to perform the best (F1 score 0.70). Both in terms of classifier performance and model interpretability (i.e., whether the model focuses importance/attention on words with causal connotations in abstracts), CRED outperformed a state-of-the-art RE dataset. Moving from benchmark to real-world settings, application of our CRED-trained classification model to all the abstracts on Parkinson\'s disease (PD) resulted in predictions of both well-supported and less-studied PD-causing genes; for instance, well-supported genes, which were predicted to be causal for PD in at least 50 papers, were already found to be linked to PD in textbook sources. \r\n\r\nCRED dataset with its classifier is a concrete step towards building a robust causal relation extraction system from a biomedical corpus, and paves the way for further research in biomedical CRE such as: (1) Employing truth discovery or similar approaches to aggregate the per-abstract causal prediction scores of a gene-disease pair to obtain a corpus-wide single score for a given gene-disease pair, and (2) Complement and integrate literature-based CRE with experimental-data-based causal relation discovery, in the context of gene-disease or gene-gene causal relations. Through the research plans above, our overarching goal then is to build a robust causal relation extraction system that performs integrative analysis of large biomedical corpus (e.g., PubMed containing 25 million published abstracts) and ever-accumulating experimental data (e.g., genome-scale data on genes and proteins) to extract causal gene networks that drive disease.','Manikandan Narayanan','nmanik@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-17 11:01:36','Active'),(1265,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\'\'INVESTIGATING THE IMPACT OF B2B SALESPERSONSâ€™ SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE ON SALES PERFORMANCE THROUGH SMALL TALK\'\'','Ms. ANU MARY CHACKO, Roll No. MS16D203','Ph.D. SCHOLAR','Dr. VAIBHAV CHAWLA - GUIDE','DEPARTMENT OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES','2024/09/19 11:00','2024-09-19','yes','DOMS Seminar Room No. 110 / Webex link','The last two decades have witnessed many studies that tracked the impact of social media technology in the B2B sales landscape.

In this talk, I will first give a brief introduction to trapped ion quantum systems and subsequently propose a path to overcome the above limitation; I will demonstrate that a particular type of ion trap called the Penning trap can be used to realize remarkably clean bilayer crystals, wherein hundreds of ions self-organize into two well-defined layers. I will show how these bilayer crystals are made possible by the inclusion of an anharmonic trapping potential, which is readily implementable with current technology. Furthermore, I will discuss the normal modes of this system, which exhibit salient differences compared to the modes of single-plane crystals. I will also illustrate how the bilayer geometry and the unique properties of the normal modes open new opportunities, in particular in quantum sensing and quantum simulation, that are not straightforward in single-plane crystals. Excitingly, it may be possible to extend the ideas presented here to realize multilayer crystals with more than two layers.

In these perovskites when the B-site cations are non-magnetic, the Cu spins reveal variety of magnetic ordering. For example, the Cu spins show direct exchange driven ferromagnetic ordering in CaCu3Ge4O12 and CaCu3Sn4O12, but it shows a long-range superexchange driven G-type antiferromagnetic ordering in CaCu3Ti4O12. Furthermore, within the similar structural framework, the Cu spins undergo a magnetic cross-over from one phase to other by changing the stoichiometry at the magnetically inactive B-site and stabilize a series of magnetic phases. Interestingly, when the B-site is occupied by Ni (3d), Pd (4d), and Pt (5d), a site dependent and diverse electronic and magnetic phases are observed in the CaCu3B4O12 system. While the CCNiO and CCPdO stabilize in ferromagnetic phase, the CCPtO shows many degenerate spin configurations. Furthermore, the electronic structure reveals half-metallic phase for CCNiO and CCPtO, but insulating phase for CCPtO.\r\nIn this talk we will provide theoretical insights on the electronic and magnetic structure of A-site ordered perovskites with the aid of first principles calculations and model studies.','HoD Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-18 07:08:15','Active'),(1270,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Fractionally Spaced Equalizers for OTFS Systems ','Mr. Narendra Deconda (EE18D200)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. David Koilpillpai R','Electrical Engineering','2024/09/20 15:30','2024-09-20','yes','ESB 244','\r\nOrthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has been shown to provide reliable communication in high Doppler environments.

It studies the environmental resource struggles of the subaltern forest communities. The thesis unpacks the material contestations and subaltern struggles over resources, especially land, and the eradication of the forest commons. It brings out how the destruction of food sources or the invisible loss results in costs to health, knowledge, and culture. It also delves into an ethnographic study of the environmental social movement simultaneously rediscovering Indigenous cultural and relational values.\r\nIt studies the Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) or folk healing and its relevance for the bioregion. It also draws on the apercu of an interior forest village of Attappady turning into herbal marketplace for city-dwellers. The cultural revival of indigenous people, the preservation of the forest habitat and knowledge of biota will determine the health of this region. As planetary thresholds are to be reckoned with for climate change the ecosystem services provided by this bioregion play a significant role. Health, healing, and human terraforming become the analytical frameworks. The thesis also depicts the change from first nature to second nature to an emergent third nature. The metabolic rift between the hills and the plains results in the extraction of the Adivasi homeland and is a sign of future of agrarian crisis. I trace the shift from nomadism to territorialization to a recombinant nomadism. TEK sui generis to this forest is vital decolonial knowledge. The study suggests that decolonial feminist epistemologies of body, territory and communities together with ecofeminism could create multiple gender and ecology politics. The repository of stories, songs, oral histories, and folklore turned into rich cultural registers which I argue are as powerful as texts. This thesis brings out the dialectics in human nature interaction by interpreting landscapes and place through a historical materialist lens. It does this through combining ethnography with historical materialist method and adopting a feminist political ecology approach. The micro-processes of social and biophysical change in these forests could reveal the transitions from human terraforming at a macro level that result in biodiversity loss, syndemics, and climate change.\r\nForest ecosystems have become vital with emissions crossing planetary thresholds and shocks of the pandemic in the Anthropocene. Forest communities and their inhabitants are going through rapid transitions with capitalism, internal colonialism, and climate change. This has led to the collapse of the forest oikos or dwelling which this thesis explores through a framework of gender, ecology, and indigeneity. Storied narratives and folklore of honey gatherers, swiddeners, and medicine women are woven together with the ecological history of the forest. The empirical study finds that agrarian capitalism is increasing inequity and destroying the forest commons. Yet, there are intriguing movements in the lifeworlds of medicinal healers who use TEK to indicate the wings of an ontology of becoming and of possibilities.\r\n','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/7486112204?pwd=YmdGazc5NUk0MVBoSHhlWWR6YUcxUT09 ','','',1,'2024-09-18 07:56:01','Active'),(1273,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Exploring Aerial Robotic Systems for on-Demand Quantification of Methane Emissions','Dr. Javier GonzÃ¡lez-Rocha, Assistant Professor in the Applied Mathematics Department at UC Santa Cruz.

They can significantly contribute to the global development agenda, as emphasized in the United Nationsâ€™ sustainable development goals. The undesirable pollution levels, resource consumption, wage inequalities, and poor worker health and safety in its manufacturing sector are among the main reasons India lags in its sustainability commitments. Although sustainability has become a boardroom discussion in these firms, they struggle to implement high-impact actions. This problem can be remedied if firms proactively strengthen their intrinsic capabilities. Therefore, the thesis aims to understand how sustainability capabilities can be developed in the Indian manufacturing sector in firms that belong to various stages of development.\r\n\r\nBased on a comprehensive literature review that helped formulate the research objectives, a series of independent studies combining qualitative and quantitative methods were built around the theoretical framework of the Dynamic Capability View. Study 1 provides insights into the routines underlying sustainability capabilities in young manufacturing firms by employing a case study-based design and TISM-MICMAC (N=12). It revealed that sustainability cognitive framing is the key driving routine, whereas strategic pivoting is the key dependent routine. All the other routines, collaboration with academic incubators, talent management, circular economy practices, sustainable supplier selection, customer co-creation, sustainability signaling, collaboration with incumbent firms, founding teamsâ€™ skill and experiential diversity, manufacturing flexibility, and learning ambidexterity are linkage routines.\r\nStudy 2 examines the role of sustainability capabilities structured at different levels in driving the performance of incumbent firms. The analysis of the cross-sectional survey conducted in listed manufacturing firms (N=242) revealed that higher-order dynamic sustainability capabilities have a significant impact on environmental and social sustainability performance irrespective of external turbulence and organizational inertia, whereas it has no significant effect on economic sustainability. The lower-order capabilities of innovation, knowledge management, and relational and managerial capabilities have differential impacts on each sustainability pillar. The study also showed that contingent environmental conditions of high inertia and low turbulence can invigorate specific capability pathways.\r\nStudy 3 investigates how young and incumbent firms collaborate to drive sustainability using a Policy Delphi instrument, which captured consensus and dissent among multiple stakeholders, namely entrepreneurs, corporate leaders in manufacturing, and other ecosystem enablers (N=60). It revealed that firms primarily utilize equity-based collaboration models such as corporate venture capital and corporate accelerators and prefer collaborating in the environmental domain over the social domain. The study also highlighted that cost and risk sharing are the primary drivers of collaboration, and ensuring partner compatibility is the main barrier to collaboration.\r\nThe set of studies in this thesis unveils that dynamic sustainability capabilities are superior capabilities that can even substitute for the absence of lower-level capabilities. They provide a picture of how building sustainability capabilities requires resource recombination and co-specialization, both in young and incumbent firms. They also advance the theoretical paradigm that capability building is too complex to be viewed as a direct linear flow. The findings from the research can provide strategic direction to managers and entrepreneurs embracing sustainability capabilities as part of their firm strategy, especially underlining the role of collaboration for sustained value creation. For policymakers, these studies can act as a guide to identifying the right policy and intervention mix to balance triple bottom-line objectives in firms.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-18 12:55:38','Active'),(1275,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Sensors, Sample Preparation, and Fluidic Manipulation','Dr. Ruchi Gupta','School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.\r\nE-mail: r.gupta.3@bham.ac.uk ','Dr. V V Raghavendra Sai ','Department of Applied Mechanics & Biomedical Engineering','2024/11/27 15:00','2024-11-27','yes','Newton Hall (Aerospace Building)','In this presentation, I will discuss the work done in my group on a type of optical sensors called leaky waveguides (LWs).

LWs are universal sensors and hence we have been working to extend their applications to a range of protein biomarkers (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factors, lactoferrin), DNA, and small molecules. I will then discuss integration of LW sensors with (1) electrokinetic sample manipulation for reducing analysis time [2], (2) microfluidic gradient generator for simultaneous quantification and calibration [3] and integration with complementary electrochemical methods [4]. \r\nSubsequently, I will discuss our research on hydrogels for concentration, fluorescent labelling, and light-triggered release of proteins followed by their detection [5]. Currently, our hydrogel can measure proteins with a limit of detection of 0.003 ppm or 53 pM for an exemplar analyte, streptavidin, while being less laborious than the state-of-the-art method, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Equally, we have shown that the presence of high molecular weight interferents such as mucin at 100- and 1000-times higher concentrations than the exemplar analyte did not influence protein measurement. Our aim is to use our hydrogels to make lozenges and lollipops for concentration and labelling of salivary biomarkers for detection of oral cancer.\r\nFinally, I will discuss an upcoming research direction in my group on fluidic manipulation using acoustics [6]. I will describe our studies on an oscillatory chemical reaction (Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction) and a bioassay (fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and esterase enzyme assay) in acoustically levitated droplets.

The formation of dunes is due to higher bed shear stress. They continuously migrate\r\ndownstream. The migration of dune is a function of flow velocity and dune geometry. The\r\ninteraction between dune geometry and flow results in formation of turbulent vortices at dune\r\ncrest. These vortices reaches up to free surface and cause fluctuations in the flow depth. The flow\r\nfield over dunes is non-uniform and it consists of both fast and slow-moving fluid zones. In\r\naddition, flow field over dunes contains boundary layer, flow separation and wake zones. The\r\nnon-uniform flow field influences sediment erosion and deposition processes on the river bed.\r\nHence, understanding the dune formation, its growth and geometry is essential to estimate the\r\nflow velocity and sediment transport. The change in the dune geometry and bar formations cause\r\nrise in the flow depth of the river which leads to inundation of the floodplains. In India and\r\nBangladesh, every year significant population displacement and infrastructure damage occurs\r\ndue to inundation. However, the previous studies fully or partially ignored the interactions\r\nbetween dune geometry, sediment, and flow characteristics. In addition, the three-dimensional\r\nshape of the dunes has often been simplified as an asymmetric triangle in the literature. The\r\ndeveloped equations from these studies have limitations in predicting dune height and bed load\r\ntransport. Also, the complex flow field over three-dimensional dunes is not fully understood.\r\nConsidering the above research gaps, the present study is planned to carry out experiments for\r\nunderstanding bed morphology, flow hydrodynamics and sediment transport by varying sediment\r\nsize (D50 = 0.2, 0.4 mm) and Froude number (0.3 to 0.6). These experiments help in\r\nunderstanding the formation of 3D dunes and its shape. Numerical simulations are planned to\r\nevaluate the influence of dune geometry (lee angle, crest line, and spacing) on the flow field. The\r\ndata obtained from the proposed experimental study along with data from the literature would be\r\nused to develop machine learning models for predicting dune height.','Manikandan.

In this prospect TMCs have been reported to show exemplary performance\r\nwhich can replace platinum as ORR electrocatalyst. However, synthesis of TMCs that\r\ncombines high activity and long-term stability along with high specific surface area is still a\r\nchallenge. Hence, in this work in situ crystallized TMCs in a Si-based polymer derived ceramic\r\n(PDC) matrix were synthesized as prospective ORR electrocatalysts. The activity provided by\r\nTMCs and high surface area enabled by single source precursor (SSP) derived ceramic route,\r\nmakes them ideal for such catalytic applications. However, there are limited studies on SSP\r\nderived ceramic nanocomposites as electrocatalysts for ORR, in particular there are no reports\r\npertaining to TMC nanocomposites obtained from SSP derived ceramic route. Also, there is a\r\nlack of understanding on the effect of the structural features and the compositional complexity\r\non the ORR electrocatalytic performance in these material systems. To enhance the\r\nunderstanding on these aspects, three types of material systems were used for investigation.\r\nThe first material system focused on modifying the Si-based PDCs with one early transition\r\nmetal element i.e., vanadium. In this study a clear correlation between the structural features\r\nof SSP derived TMC nanocomposites and ORR electrocatalytic activity was established. In the\r\nsecond materials system, modification was done using 5 transition metal elements (V, Ta, Nb,\r\nMo and W) to achieve in situ crystallization of high entropy carbides (HECs) in Si-based\r\nceramic matrix with varying crystal structures by changing the precursor architecture.

Ti-6Al-4V is frequently used for biomedical implants because of its exceptional qualities, which include low density, specific strength, biocompatibility, and corrosion resistance. The AM LPBF Ti-6Al-4V results in the formation of metastable microstructure made up of martensite (Î±â€²), which have poor ductility. The heat treatment can transform into stable microstructure and also improves ductility. The current research involves the selection of heat treatment temperature below the Î²-transus temperature (995 áµ’C) of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy: 750 áµ’C, 850 áµ’C and 950 áµ’C. This work aims in elucidating the evolution of microstructure in as built (AB) and heat-treated conditions. Furthermore, the present work focuses on understanding the mechanical, corrosion and wear properties by studying the underlying microstructure and phase transformation via correlative microscopy approach and co-relating to property. \r\nThe AB exhibits acicular Î±â€²-phase, which on heat-treatment decomposes to stable Î±- and Î²- phases. Segregations with Î±â€²-phase have been observed; these segregations are enriched in Î²-stabilizing elements (V and Si), which are more prevalent around defective sites such grain boundaries and dislocations. These locations act as potent sources for the nucleation of Î²-phase. During low temperature annealing (750 áµ’C), clustering of V-atoms was observed randomly in the form of nano precipitates which signified the onset of Î±â€² decomposition. The decomposition, however, is expected to be complete beyond 850 áµ’C with the evolution of a distinct interface as a result of elemental partitioning. The contribution of Î²-stabilizers towards element partitioning is almost 3-fold compared to Î±-stabilizers. The AB possessed a tensile strength of >1200 MPa with ~8% ductility. The heat treatment improved the ductility to ~13%. The tensile properties are governed by the morphological characteristics of lamellar microstructure such as Î±-lath/lamellae size, grain size and Î±-colony size. The AB containing fully Î±â€² showed inferior corrosion resistance, and is improved more than 50% after annealing > 850 áµ’C. The corrosion resistance is found to be improved by a fine combination of Î±- and Î²-phases with lamellar morphology, increased Î²-phase fraction and reduced microstructural defect density. The AB samples presented the lowest coefficient of friction (COF) and highest wear loss attributing to the presence of a very fine and hard Î±â€². However, the Î± and Î² after annealing led to a marginal increase in COF and reduced wear loss. The wear mechanism changes from a predominantly abrasive wear at lower load to a combination of predominantly adhesive-oxidation dominated wear at higher load. The heat treatment in the range of around 850 áµ’C gives an optimal combination of strength and ductility, good corrosion and wear resistance, which can be highly recommended for biomedical implants.','MME OFFICE 2','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','Keywords: Additive manufacturing, titanium alloys, heat treatment, mechanical, corrosion, fretting w','','',1,'2024-09-20 05:19:10','Active'),(1284,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Nonlinear Analysis of Damage in Woven-Patch and Scarf Repaired Laminate Composites','Ms. Monika Kushwaha (AM18D206)','Ph.

Despite their advantages, FRCs are prone to damage, which can compromise structural integrity. Traditional repair methods using rivets and bolts often prove inefficient. Adhesion-based repair techniques, such as scarf and patch repairs, offer superior solutions by minimizing weight gain, reducing stress concentrations, and enhancing load capacities. In patch repair, an external patch is bonded directly onto the damaged area with or without removing the damaged region. Scarf repair involves material removal from the damaged area in a tapered shape with a specialized machining tool, and a matching patch is bonded inside the hole with adhesive. Damage in composite structures typically involves a combination of failure modes, including matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination. The finite element method (FEM) is widely used for simulating and optimizing patch design. This study offers valuable insights into repair design for woven laminates by analyzing their tensile behavior using a three-dimensional energy-based progressive damage model and modified Hashin failure criteria. A three-dimensional, energy-based progressive damage model was developed to simulate scarf and patch-repaired laminates, incorporating shear nonlinearity under tensile loading. Experimental investigations using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and Acoustic Emission (AE) techniques were conducted to validate the model. The model was then used to analyze the influence of patch size on the failure strength of repaired laminates. Additionally, the effects of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) on the epoxy matrix properties were experimentally determined and correlated with micromechanical models. Tensile tests combined with 3D-DIC were used to validate a three-dimensional, energy-based progressive damage model incorporating a strain-based exponential softening law. The model was subsequently employed to investigate the impact of scarf angle, nanoparticle concentration in the adhesive bond line, and patch configuration on the tensile strength of repaired laminates.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline Meeting Link: https://meet.google.com/vpz-bufk-rjn','','',1,'2024-09-20 05:28:09','Active'),(1285,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Effective Literacy Rate Measure, Primary Education, and Job Mismatch: An Empirical Study in India','Mr Soumyaranjan Mukherjee (HS21D029) ','Research Scholar, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras.','Prof. Anup Kumar Bhandari (Guide), Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras.','Department of Humanities and Social Sciences','2024/09/23 16:00','2024-09-23','yes','Google meet','A literate member generates a positive externality amongst the illiterates within her/his proximity. The conventional adult literacy rate doesnâ€™t put any emphasis on that. However, Basu and Foster (1998) theoretically introduce the  concept of Effective Literacy (EL) as an alternative measure by incorporating this aspect. We estimate EL using India Human Development Survey (IHDS)-I and -II data for 31 states and union territories following three alternative strategies: (a) gender-neutral EL; (b) gender-adjusted EL; and (c) modified gender-adjusted EL. To be specific, (a) is the case when the extent of externality is the same irrespective of the gender of the literate member. Likewise, (b) is the case when the extent of externality depends on the gender of the literate memberâ€”as postulated by Basu and Foster (1998); and (b) is further modified to reach (c) by incorporating the relative share of female and male literates within a household. We subsequently explain the Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) using the adult literacy rate vis-Ã -vis EL. Major findings include (i) female literates generate larger externality value as opposed to males; (ii) EL is a better predictor of NSDP; and (iii) literate people are distributed more evenly across households in IHDS-II than IHDS-I. Nonetheless, despite overall EL improvements in IHDS-II, widening disparities are also observed across states and union territories, implying that some of them benefit more than others. Since literacy is an obvious growth-fostering factor, policymakers should use EL while framing suitable policy decisions, particularly in light of our finding (ii).\r\n             Parents\' decision to enroll their children in school is often influenced by their understanding of education\'s benefits and the positive impact literate individuals have on their community. Despite efforts to achieve universal literacy in India, challenges persist. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), introduced in 2006 to improve rural livelihoods through development and job creation, may also indirectly benefit primary education in rural areas. By improving rural poverty status, especially among women, MGNREGA can positively affect children\'s educational outcomes. This area of research, exploring MGNREGA\'s impact on education, is where we aim to make further contributions.\r\n             Additionally, the quality of education and public perception significantly affect school enrollment rates. However, a mismatch between teachers\' educational qualifications and skills and the demands of their jobs can lower educational quality, leading to student disengagement and higher dropout rates. Thus, both the effective literacy rate and job mismatch in the education sector are crucial factors in understanding school enrollment patterns and educational outcomes.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Literacy Rate; Effective Literacy Rate; Proximate illiteracy; Externality; Primary Education; MGNREGA; Job Mismatch.','HS Office','hsoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/nqd-cyqq-mno','','',1,'2024-09-20 05:48:55','Active'),(1286,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','testmail','test','test@iitm.ac.in','test','cc','2024/09/20 16:00','2024-09-20','','testing','test mail cannot be moderate','test','test@gmail.com','test-web confernce linkadd','','',0,'2024-09-20 01:56:30',''),(1287,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','â€œA PAPER-BASED ACOUSTOFLUIDIC DEVICE FOR POINT-OF-CARE APPLICATIONâ€','MR.

Cell lysis is a necessary and important step in obtaining DNA. Ultrasonication is a physical disruption method where the shock waves from inertial cavitation and shear stress generated from cavitation microstreaming lyse the cells in suspension. Cavitation microstreaming is the steady non-oscillatory flow induced by a bubble oscillating in an acoustic field. Here, shear stresses near an oscillating bubble can cause cell wall rupture without affecting the cytoplasm. The control over acoustic parameters such as frequency and amplitude facilitates manipulation of the hydrodynamics of the system. This can be used for cell lysis, micromixing, sonoporation and other applications in microfluidic systems. The traditional sonicators operate at a fixed frequency and power and generate considerable noise, even for a minimum sample size. We propose a two-zone, single-chip acoustofluidic device capable of cell lysis and DNA purification. For point-of-care applications, we propose a paper-based acoustofluidic device. The paper consists of microfibres that oscillate under an acoustic field. We utilize these oscillating microfibres to generate streaming and lyse the cells, followed by DNA purification. The manipulation of acoustic parameters shows a transition from acoustic streaming to Faraday waves. This acoustofluidic paper-based analytical device can reduce the cost of detection and use of foreign chemicals.\r\nKeywords: Cavitation microstreaming, cell lysis, DNA purification, acoustofluidics, paper-based devices.','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','seminar20-09-2024 10:17','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar20-09-2024 10:17',1,'2024-09-20 10:18:00','Active'),(1288,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','\" Battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage systems: technology assessment, and market analysis-based business plan \"','Mr. Sandeep Kumar (MM21S400)','MS Scholar, Dept of MME.','Guide: Dr. Tiju Thomas , MME.','Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering','2024/09/26 15:30','2024-09-26','yes','Online (Google Meet)','\" A market-analysis-based business plan has been developed for Battery-Supercapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (BSHESS) to meet end-userâ€™s and potential customerâ€™s requirements in off-grid and portable power segments.

BSHESS delivery allows 10 times fast charging (compared to a pure battery source) for pulse power demand. The calculated peak shaving percentages range from 20% to over 50%.

Mg-based DRs like MgTiO3, Mg2TiO4 and Mg2SiO4 possess ultra-high QÃ—f which lies in the range 1,50,000 - 2,40,000 GHz along with dielectric constant (Îµr) in the range 7 - 171â€“3. However, growing communication technology brings in the need for miniaturization which prefers higher Îµr ceramics because the size of the DR would reduce with an increase in Îµr for a given operational frequency. Few such DRs include MgNb2O6 and ZnNb2O6 which possess Îµr in the range 20 - 25 with high QÃ—f in the range 75,000 - 94,000 GHz4. DRs with Îµr > 28 and reasonably high QÃ—f in the range of 36,000 - 60,000 GHz are also reported, including LaZn1/2Ti1/2O3 and LaMg1/2Ti1/2O35, 6. Since the signal loss within the DRs is inversely dependent on the QÃ—f, enhancement of QÃ—f of the high Îµr DRs becomes necessary for better performance of miniaturized devices. This is possible through substitution in lattice sites as observed in systems like Ba1-xLixSi2O5-x/2, LaMg1/2Ti1/2-xSnxO3 and Zn1+xNb2O67â€“9. Significantly enhanced QÃ—f along with marginally reduced Îµr of these solid solutions are correlated to the intrinsic factors like bond strength, B-site long range ordering, packing fraction of the ions etc. and extrinsic factors like porosity and surface morphology. \r\nPresent work involves the enhancement of microwave dielectric properties of Zn(Nb1-2xTixWx)2O6, La1-xYxMg1/2Ti1/2O3 and La1-xYxZn1/2Ti1/2O3 solid solutions and correlation of the dielectric properties with the several factors like structural changes, grain growth, porosity etc. XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM and density measurement techniques are utilized to study these ceramics. Microwave dielectric and antenna characterizations are also done to show the better performance of the higher QÃ—f samples.  \r\nReferences\r\n1. 	Lai Y, Hong C, Jin L, et al.

The foremost objective of any biorefinery is to obtain valuable products from its carbohydrate fraction (cellulose and hemicellulose), and also make efficient use of the lignin for the production of aromatic chemicals. Besides, bio-oils obtained from the thermochemical processes like pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass can be a prominent source of high-value chemicals. However, its upgradation is required to reduce its high oxygen content for its easy transportation, storage and further processing. In this view, the present work aims at studying heterogeneous catalytic processes, namely reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF), and catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) for the upgradation of biomass, biomass-derived oxygenates, and bio-oils. Firstly, RCF is studied for the separation of lignin from the biomass in its stable and useful form. The activity of carbon supported Pt-, Pd-, Ni-, and Ru-catalysts, and the effect of reaction conditions on the degree of lignin separation and product selectivity is studied. Secondly, HDO of single and binary mixtures of bio-oil oxygenates is studied using a set of carbon supported Pt-, Pd-, and Ru-catalysts and zeolite Y supported Pt catalysts. In the HDO of binary mixtures of oxygenates, the effects of acid, ketone, and aldehyde functional groups on the HDO of guaiacol (a major bio-oil oxygenate) is evaluated.

However, bus patronage has declined over the years in many parts of the world due to inefficient, inaccessible, unreliable, and overcrowded services. To address this problem, this study aims to leverage real-time data from automatic vehicle location and electronic ticketing devices to evaluate and improve multiple transit service quality indices (accessibility, travel time reliability, and crowding). First, comprehensive models are developed that address the lack of understanding of factors affecting service and information unreliability and information accuracy. Also, the developed models help predict the service and information quality in real time. Findings indicate that dispatch delays, travel time stochasticity, and prediction methods significantly affect the quality of arrival time information provided to users. The real-time information error predictions from the proposed parametric and non-parametric models reduce the error in bus arrival time estimates (25-45% improvement in MAE) and help improve the effectiveness of passenger information systems. Secondly, a multi-destination k simple shortest paths problem is proposed, and a novel and exact label-setting algorithm is developed that is theoretically faster in both sparse and dense networks, is flexible in solving versatile problems and outperforms existing deviation-based methods. Moreover, heuristic and optimized data structures proposed in this study enhance scalability and performance, demonstrating 2-3 orders of magnitude speedups (29â€“1416 times across different networks) with negligible solution quality loss (maximum average deviation of 0.167% from the optimal solution). Finally, unlike existing passenger information systems that primarily focus on expected travel times, an accelerated failure time model accounting for data missingness is developed for estimating expected travel times together with the associated uncertainties for better travel planning and enhancing the reliability of the transit system. The model outperforms existing methods in both mean and reliability predictions with an average coverage error of 0.6% and is computationally efficient in providing real-time en-route estimates of travel time reliability. Ongoing work will complete integrating the above models and algorithms with a bi-objective crowding-based routing algorithm and a multi-objective Pareto optimization algorithm for real-time information. The proposed research is expected to improve multiple service quality indicators through better transit route selection and operator interventions.','R.

Heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation is   very advantageous technique for hydrogenating polymers. This research work outlines the synthesis of hydrogenated HTPB (HHTPB) using HTPB polymer as a precursor by catalytic hydrogenation method using iso-propyl alcohol and toluene as a solvent media.  A novel synthesis approach to hydrogenate HTPB has been developed using various catalysts. Experiments were conducted in a 100 ml capacity reactor made-up of Inconel alloy with a magnetically driven variable speed impeller. Various parameters like operating temperature, operating pressure, solvent-to-feed ratio, and the concentration of the catalyst were optimized by conducting multiple experiments. The composition and microstructure of the in-house synthesized catalyst were characterized using SEM and TEM, XRD, and particle size distribution. HTPB and HHTPB polymers were characterized by NMR, FTIR, and chemical analysis. The results showed that the degree of hydrogenation of HTPB is greater than 79% for the optimized operating parameters and the reactor volume with the chosen operating conditions. It is understood that the formation of HHTPB was predominantly controlled by both physisorption and chemisorption. After hydrogenation of HTPB, an insignificant change in hydroxyl value was observed, and the HHTPB formed is of vinyl-type functional isomer. A slight increase in molecular weight was observed after hydrogenation.','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/qum-jgyc-zsrâ€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬','seminar23-09-2024 03:02','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar23-09-2024 03:02',1,'2024-09-23 03:02:40','Active'),(1293,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','â€œMECHANISTIC ELUCIDATION OF PARTIAL OXIDATION OF METHANE TO ALCOHOLS.â€','MR.

Methane upon performing partial oxidation can give valuable chemical feedstock like methanol, formaldehyde, and formic acid. In this context, the current work focuses on the mechanistic investigation of the methane partial oxidation on zeolite-based, metallic and metal oxide-based catalysts using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations.  \r\nIn the first part of the work, liquid phase methane partial oxidation on Fe-ZSM5 catalyst with sulfolane as the solvent and H2O2 as the oxidant was investigated. Our DFT results showed that the formation of active species such as Fe-OH and Fe=O from H2O2 dissociation is likely on the catalyst. On these active species, the C-H bond activation of methane led to the formation of a methyl radical (CH3â€¢), which in turn formed methanol via methoxy species (OCH3). The formation of active species such as Fe-OH and Fe=O, together with limited H2O2 supply around the active species, were expected to be the reasons for the high selectivity of methanol in the sulfolane compared to water as reported in the literature. In the second part of the work, aqueous phase methane partial oxidation on Ir-ZSM5 catalyst with O2 as oxidant and CO as promoter was investigated. Our DFT results showed the formation of Ir(CO)2 which upon interaction with molecular O2 resulted in the formation of Ir(CO)O as the active species. Our mechanistic investigation revealed that the â€œIr-Oâ€ species activated methane in a radical mechanism and subsequently formed methanol by a radical rebound mechanism. The coupling of the â€œ-CH3â€ radical with the CO to form CH3CO had a high barrier, explaining the limited formation of acetic acid. Upon promotion of the Ir-ZSM-5 catalyst with copper, the favorable active species for methane oxidation was found to be (H2O)2Cu=O which was likely to be selective to methanol as shown earlier with the Fe-ZSM5 catalyst. In the third part of the work, aqueous phase methane partial oxidation on Au/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst and FeOx-Au/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst was investigated. Our DFT simulations showed a preferential formation of methanol on the Au/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst while there was a preferential formation of ethanol on methanol on FeOx-Au/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst. On the FeOx-Au/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst, the FeOx-Au interface enabled methane activation across the interface, and the coupling step leading to the formation of ethanol happened on the gold nanoparticle. The reaction mechanism involved the formation of â€œ-CH2OHâ€ intermediate. \r\nOverall, this work offers a comprehensive insight into methane partial oxidation on various catalytic systems, studying the impact of different solvents, oxidants and catalytic promoters on the reaction mechanisms and product distribution.  These would enable design of efficient methane partial oxidation systems comprising appropriate catalyst, solvent, oxidant and promoter for high yield of alcohols from methane oxidation.','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/wkm-dahj-niyâ€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬','seminar23-09-2024 03:10','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar23-09-2024 03:10',1,'2024-09-23 03:10:23','Active'),(1294,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Enhanced Faster than Nyquist Signalling using RNNs','Mr. Shubham Paul (EE19D407)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. David Koilpillpai R','Electrical Engineering','2024/09/24 14:30','2024-09-24','yes','ESB 244','The decoding of Highly Compressed Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signals using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is the focus of this talk.

Designing a metric specifically for the problem at hand enhances the performance of these tasks. Handcrafting such metrics for a specific task can be both challenging and inefficient. As a result, there is a growing interest in automatically learning metrics from data. The process of automatically learning metrics from data is called metric learning. Metric learning is an integrated step for many learning algorithms, and the adopted metric significantly influences their performance.\r\n\r\nUnsupervised metric learning focuses on learning discriminative representations by grouping similar examples without relying on labels. Many algorithms in this area combine clustering-based pseudo-label generation with embedding fine-tuning. However, pseudo-labels can be unreliable and noisy, which may negatively impact metric learning and degrade the quality of the learned representations. To address this issue, we propose a method that reduces the adverse effects of label noise on learning discriminative embeddings by incorporating context and prediction uncertainty. Our approach refines pseudo-labels by aggregating information from neighboring examples and uses these refined labels to generate pairwise constraints. We also apply hard example mining to identify informative pairs for metric learning. We introduce a function to weigh these pairs based on their prediction confidence and uncertainty, and we modify the metric learning loss function to incorporate this weight.

However, the substantially limited historical yield records, coupled with the multi-directional property of the spatiotemporal yield data, pose a significant challenge. Moreover, a lack of awareness among farmers leads to misestimation of crop production, which results in a formidable challenge for the farmers to fulfil the obligations associated with their financial loans. Building Machine Learning models to predict crop yield is an effective approach but is acutely challenged by the availability of data. The calibration of the crop simulation model can be affected due to the lack of data. The objective of this work is to develop AI-ML models that predict yields with and without the incorporation of a physics model. We have focused on developing two crop model configurations, soybean and groundnut, in two Indian geographical locations, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, respectively.\r\nWe develop an architecture named Multi-STAge Clustered Prediction (M-STAC), tailored for crop yield prediction. The hallmark of this architecture is that it systematically incorporates various features. The primary attributes of this model are that it is layered (accounting for temporal and spatial feature incorporation), based on the philosophy of error modelling, and utilizes a fusion technique that imbibes classification and regression methods. The exogenous features are chosen based on a physiological understanding of plant growth. Each iteration of the architecture captures the different characteristics of the regressors. The base model, which is a pure time series LSTM model, allows a supplementary option in case the exogenous variables (such as weather, soil, and vegetation data) are unavailable. Standard and widely used models failed to perform well on soybean crop; as generic methods, they do not consider domain-specific information. However, LASSO showed a similar performance as the M-STAC Prediction model for groundnut crop.\r\nWe also demonstrate the performance of a physics-infused AI-ML (hybrid) model, that varies with the calibration of the crop simulation model. The prediction skill of the hybrid model compared to the standalone machine learning model is thus conditional on the effective calibration of the physics model.\r\n\r\n\r\n','K P Geetha','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/eco-dbgt-cix','','',1,'2024-09-23 05:52:03','Active'),(1298,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€œCharge Carrier Dynamics in Lead Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals: Influence of Capping Ligands, Doping, Core/Shell Nano Inclusionâ€','Ms. Soumi Roy (CY18D033)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide- Prof. Edamana Prasad, \r\nDC Chairperson- Prof. Ranga Rao G, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/09/25 11:30','2024-09-25','yes','Online-Google Meet','','CY OFFICE','cyoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','ALL ARE WELCOME-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/vso-bfsk-xic','','',1,'2024-09-23 06:43:04','Active'),(1299,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','OPTIMIZING TURBINE BLADE TIP DESIGN: BALANCING LEAKAGE REDUCTION AND EFFICIENCY','Mr. Sachin Singh Rawat (ME17S017 )','MS Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide Name: Prof. Babu Viswanathan, ME /\r\nGTC Members:  1) Prof. Dhiman Chatterjee, ME\r\n2) Prof. S.

By employing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, the research quantitatively evaluates the effectiveness of different tip modifications in reducing tip leakage flow and its subsequent impact on stage efficiency. These modifications include full squealers with varying cavity depths, partial squealers (suction side and pressure side), and winglets with different widths. The key findings reveal that full squealers with an appropriate cavity depth are the most effective configuration for minimizing tip leakage flow and achieving the highest stage efficiency among the analysed modifications. This improvement can be attributed to the formation of a recirculation bubble within the cavity that restricts leakage flow. The analysis quantified that a full squealer with a cavity depth of 0.6 times the tip gap achieved a stage efficiency improvement of 0.292% compared to the flat tip baseline. While winglets demonstrate potential for reducing tip leakage, their width needs careful optimization to balance gains from leakage reduction with the aerodynamic losses they introduce. The analysis suggests that winglets with a width of 0.2 times the tip gap resulted in a minimal stage efficiency increase of 0.145%, due to the counteracting effects of reduced leakage and increased aerodynamic losses. Partial squealers, on the other hand, were found to be detrimental to stage efficiency due to increased entropy generation within the tip gap, likely caused by flow separation and turbulence within the partial cavities. The analysis quantified that a suction side squealer resulted in a stage efficiency decrease of 0.547% compared to the flat tip baseline. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the relationship between blade tip design, tip leakage flow, and turbine stage efficiency. The findings can guide engineers in optimizing tip modifications for improved efficiency while considering trade-offs between leakage reduction and potential aerodynamic losses. By implementing these optimized tip designs, turbine manufacturers can achieve significant efficiency gains, leading to increased power generation and reduced environmental impact.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/qti-ewnd-cgc','','',1,'2024-09-23 09:45:16','Active'),(1300,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Species selective disorder in Ashkin-Teller Model','Mr. KETAN MAHENDRAKUMAR AMIN, (PH19D044)','PhD Scholar','Guide: Dr. Rajesh Narayanan','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/09/24 16:00','2024-09-24','yes','HSB- 226A, DCF Conference Room, Department of Physics ','In this seminar, we will look at the impact of quenched disorder on systems where the translationally invariant system hosts a first order transition. A prototypical example of the same is the so-called N-species (or color) Ashkin Teller model that effectively describes the physics of N Ising models interacting via their energy densities. It has been shown via laying recourse to a perturbative RG frame-work [1,2] that the quenched impurities rounds the first order transition, and the effective critical behavior is that of the N-decoupled disordered Ising model. The results of the perturbative RG have also been confirmed by using large scale Monte-Carlo simulations [3]. In the thesis we plan to investigate the effects of engineered disorder potentials wherein each color in the Ashkin-Teller model sees a different disorder profile. Such species selective disorder has already been investigated in the case of the attractive Hubbard model wherein the two spin species (for the up and down spin fermions), sees different impurity potential [4]. These studies have unravelled the impurity induced stabilisation of the so-called breached pair phase where superconductivity co-exists with magnetic order. Thus, motivated by these results we develop a perturbative RG approach to studying the impact of species selective disorder in the Ashkin-Teller model. Further, we look for effects such as replica symmetry breaking in such models and investigate whether the species selectiveness leads to exotic phases, and interesting critical behavior.\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n[1] Cardy J.

Microstructural\r\nevolution in the components during AW-DED is strongly influenced by the multi-pass\r\nthermal cycles that prevail during the melting and solidification of the feedstock wires.\r\nAmong all the AW-DED AM processes, Gas Metal Arc (GMA-DED) based process is\r\nseen attractive to produce geometrically simple and large-volume components. In this\r\nprocess, thermal cycles can be favourably modified by varying current-voltage waveforms.\r\nMoreover, solidification microstructures can also be altered by using a combination of\r\npulsing and short-circuiting metal transfer strategies.

One of the common water management activities is to intentionally regulate the streamflow using numerous Small and Medium Reservoirs (SMRs). Continuous hydrologic models like the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) have been used to evaluate the long-term impacts of such water management activities. However, the representation of SMRs in hydrologic models is often simplified due to the lack of data availability. Hence, in this study, three different model configurations viz., disregarding the presence of SMRs (M1), a statistically aggregated approach (M2), and a hybrid approach â€“ a combination of statistically aggregated and a spatially explicit representation of SMRs (M3) in the increasing order of model complexity are considered. The objective of this research is to analyze how increased model complexity affects the model performance and its subsequent impact on the uncertainty of model parameters and water balance components. The findings reveal that the M3 configuration with the hybrid approach (KGE = 0.77) outperforms M1 (0.69) and M2 (0.68). In addition, the M3 configuration with increased model complexity results in an average uncertainty bandwidth score of 19.79% (characterized by fixed and narrow bandwidth of parameters) when compared to M1 (42.91%) and M2 (40.85%). Finally, the analysis of water balance components reveals that although there is considerable variability in the surface runoff (SURQ), percolation (PERC), and base flow (GW Q) for all configurations, the water yield (WYLD) for M3 configuration alone had a narrow bandwidth. This is mainly because of the existence of very strong correlation between, SURQ vs PERC (r = -0.98), SURQ vs GW Q (r = -0.93), and PERC vs GW Q (r = 0.97) in the M3 configuration, indicating the strong impact of modelling the SMRs using a hybrid approach. This clearly demonstrates the importance of representing the SMRs appropriately within the river basin scale model, as it considerably reduces the uncertainty in the streamflow simulations due to better parameterization.  This impacts the hydrologic process simulations and plays a vital role in the estimation of the water balance components. Overall, the improved representation of SMRs in the hydrologic model will help in formulating sustainable water management policies for informed decision-making.\r\n\r\n','R.

In contrast, at some Reynolds numbers (Re = U0D\r\nÎ½ ) or non-\r\ndimensional spin factors (Î± = Ï‰R\r\nU0 ), the ball deflects in the opposite direction of the\r\nMagnus force, known as the inverse Magnus effect. U0 is the freestream velocity, D\r\nis the ball diameter, and Î½ is the kinematic viscosity. The inverse Magnus effect is\r\ntypically accompanied by the formation of a laminar separation bubble (LSB) on\r\nthe advancing side of the spinning ball. High-fidelity LES (large eddy simulation)\r\ncomputations have been performed for the flow over a smooth spinning ball using\r\na transient incompressible solver of OpenFOAMÂ®. The Reynolds number chosen\r\nfor the present study was 1 Ã— 105, and the spin factors were 0.36,0.53, 0.80, and\r\n1.0 as mentioned in Kim et al. (2014), at the same Reynolds number. The non-\r\ndimensional surface pressure has been computed for flow over a stationary smooth\r\nball at the same Reynolds number and compared with the benchmark results of\r\nAchenbach (1972). The computed Strouhal number (St = f D\r\nU0 ) of vortex shedding\r\nfor stationary ball simulation is 0.1887, which matches the benchmark value of 0.189\r\n(Achenbach (1974)). The spinning smooth ball LES cases have been performed and\r\nvalidated with the benchmark results of Kim et al. (2014). Particular attention has\r\nbeen given to wake dynamics, mean force coefficients, and the state of the boundary\r\nlayer on the advancing and retreating sides.

Design and optimization of reactors for fast pyrolysis are mainly empirical and rely heavily of expensive and time-consuming experimentation. To this end, usage of simulation tools, such as CFD, is becoming ubiquitous. However, tackling the complexity of biomass-fast pyrolysis in fluidized beds makes it difficult to validate the simulation predictions. Recently, micro fluidized bed reactors (MFBR) have been used to investigate the kinetics of biomass pyrolysis as an alternative to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These reactors offer a simple and small geometry and make the investigation of biomass fast pyrolysis tractable. \r\nThe work explores biomass-fast pyrolysis using an MFBR. This study consists of experimental and numerical approaches to optimize the design and operating conditions of bio-oil. To achieve this, an in-house MFBR was developed, with continuous biomass feeding under the desired reaction conditions. The initial experiments involve the characterization of biomass feedstock followed by the design of the MFB. Pressure drop was used to conduct hydrodynamic investigations for the MFBR and later to design and operate hot models. Fast pyrolysis experiments were carried out on the biomass, and a qualitative analysis of the bio-oil was performed. Finally, biomass types were varied to determine their impacts on bio-oil composition. A detailed numerical simulation was also performed to study the hydrodynamic behavior of the MFBR in the commercial software Ansys Fluent using the Euler-Euler multiphase model. Finally, the numerical results were validated against the experimental data to obtain deeper insights into the hydrodynamics. Results indicate that the design and operational parameters of the MFBR significantly affect the pyrolysis process.\r\n','K P Geetha','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/qix-dmqo-mbu ','','',1,'2024-09-24 05:43:39','Active'),(1310,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','COUPLED INSTABILITIES FROM LATERAL TORSIONAL BUCKLING AND SHEAR BUCKLING OF SINGLY SYMMETRIC STEEL I-GIRDERS',' Ms. Namita Nayak , Roll No: CE20D041','PH.D SCHOLAR','Dr. Lakshmi Priya P S - Guide , Dr. Mehar Prasad A -DC Member , Dr. Arul Jayachandran S - DC Member, \r\nDr. Bhaskar K (AE ) - DC Member,  Dr.Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head .','Civil Department','2024/09/26 15:00','2024-09-26','yes','BSB 104 Conference Room','','R.

They can act as Giant Cloud Condensation Nuclei (GCCN) or Ice Nuclei (IN), affecting the cloud processing and hydrological cycle. Bioaerosols also pose a virulent impact on living organisms by jeopardising food security, endangering wildlife, and acting as infectious allergens to human beings. In the last few years, advanced online and offline bioaerosol measurement techniques have unveiled the era of bioaerosol measurements in the Indian subcontinent. Hence, size-resolved bioaerosol measurements were conducted in the current study at two contrasting locations (Gurdaspur and Chennai) in the Indian tropical region. The type and diversity of bioaerosols were identified using the Next-Generation Sequencing technique, and real-time bioaerosol measurements were carried out using an Ultra-Violet Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (UV-APS). Morphological characteristics of the bioaerosols were also studied using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). During the study, the size-resolved diversity based on the characteristic properties of fungal and bacterial bioaerosols and daily variations of fluorescent biological aerosol particles, along with meteorological parameters, were analysed. The study also identified many pathogenic and beneficial fungal and bacterial species in the ambient air. The detailed results will be presented. The results showed that a strong interplay mechanism between bioaerosol concentration and their size distribution to meteorology is a highly significant factor in the role of bioaerosols in climate and ecosystem health interaction, particularly in a highly diverse country like India.','R.

Among these, 1, 55,781 (33.8%) were classified as fatal accidents, which should raise serious concern, and 2, 78,734 (60.4%) were categorized as accidents causing injuries. Over the last decade, the proportion of total accidents attributed to HCRVs stands at approximately 20%, out of which 38%was fatal; it is a concerning statistic given that HCRVs represent only about 5.4% of the total vehicle population. Among various vehicle types involved in fatal crashes, 22% of fatalities were due to rollovers of large trucks and buses, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) report in the year 2021 in the USA. Therefore, ensuring road safety through rollover prevention is vital for this vehicle class and holds considerable research importance. This dissertation focuses on model-based detection and preventing un-tripped rollovers in heavy commercial road vehicles using differential braking. An accurate 4-DoF mathematical model was developed, including roll dynamics to detect un-tripped rollovers using the load transfer ratio and validated against data from TruckMakerÂ® leveraging existing sensing hardware. A threshold-based differential braking method was utilized to prevent rollovers. However, panic braking by the driver could cause a wheel lock, resulting in loss of traction and longer stopping distances. The rollover prevention system included an integrated rule-based anti-lock braking algorithm to address wheel lock. This algorithm calculates the desired brake pressure to prevent wheel lock by regulating wheel slip. The next step involved developing a model predictive control strategy to prevent rollovers while avoiding wheel lock, formulated as a convex optimization problem with constraints on LTR and wheel slip ratio. Experimental results confirmed the algorithmâ€™s effectiveness. However, it requires precise knowledge of vehicle parameters, such as mass and centre of gravity location, which can significantly affect rollover risk. To handle parameter variations, a robust sliding mode controller was developed for rollover prevention. Experimental evaluations using a hardware-in-the-loop setup demonstrated the algorithmâ€™s effectiveness in preventing un-tripped rollovers across varied scenarios and parametric changes. This dissertation provides valuable insights into understanding and predicting roll stability limits in HCRVs, paving the way for advancing advanced roll stability control systems using differential braking and improving heavy commercial road vehicle safety.','EDOffice','edoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-24 09:10:40','Active'),(1313,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Computational Methods to Optimize Microbial Systems for Bioprocesses','Lavanya Raajaraam (BT17D401)','PhD scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Dr. Karthik Raman (DA)','Department of Biotechnology','2024/09/30 15:00','2024-09-30','','BT Seminar Hall','Biomanufacturing is essential for achieving a â€˜net-zeroâ€™ carbon economy and a sustainable future, but the main obstacle to broader adoption is the limited yield of bioprocesses, which impacts their economic feasibility. While strategies like promoter engineering and gene deletion exist, further improvements are constrained by metabolic stress and reduction in growth. Enhancing yield through metabolite co-production and microbial communities offers promising solutions, though these approaches are complex and labour-intensive to study experimentally. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a suite of computational algorithms designed to optimize microbial systems for the production of any target chemical. Among these tools, Co-FSEOF effectively identifies gene amplification and deletion targets, as shown in its success with optimizing the co-production of iso-butanol and succinate. Additionally, our dynamic Flux Balance Analysis (dFBA) algorithm enables the comparison of microbial community growth and biosynthetic capabilities with monocultures, guiding the selection of the most efficient systems. For instance, a co-culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Bacillus subtilis achieves a 20% higher yield of spermidine and 9% more glycerol and sorbitol than their monoculture counterparts. Furthermore, methanol production is consistently greater in microbial communities, with the Pseudomonas putida - Lactococcus lactis community producing 39% higher methanol than the individual organisms. In summary, our study provides vital computational tools that enhance the efficiency of biomanufacturing, paving the way for more economically viable and sustainable bioprocesses.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-09-24 10:54:35','Active'),(1314,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Realizing Room Temperature Dipolar Excitons in van der Waals Heterostructures','Dr. Abhishek Mishra','Dr. Abhishek Misra obtained his Ph.D in micro electronics from IIT Bombay, where he was the recipient of the best Ph.D thesis award.

As a result, improving the energy density, power density, cycle life, etc. of LIBs remains a key research focus, particularly in advancing cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes and developing post-LIBs such as Na ion batteries, Ca ion batteries, etc. Interface engineering, especially at the electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI) has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the performance of LIBs and post-LIBs.[2,3] An effective application of this approach necessitates a deeper understanding of the mechanism of formation and the structure of the EEI.[4] Since the structure and composition of the electrolyte have a critical role in determining its reactivity towards the electrode surface, understanding the structure-reactivity relationship of the electrolytes for EEI formation is of large importance. In this research proposal seminar, I will be providing an overview of the literature on (i) the application of interface engineering to enhance the performance of LIBs and post-LIBs and (ii) the structure and EEI formation mechanism proposed for some of the commonly used electrolytes used in LIBs and post-LIBs.

This research aims to systematically investigate the effects of polyelectrolyte hydrophobicity, stereochemistry, charge density, surfactant aggregation number, and organic solvent composition on specific issues within the studied systems. The hydration shells of different polymer chain moieties significantly affect the dynamic aspects of bound water molecules. In terms of charge density, the conformational, hydration, and thermodynamic behavior of dicarboxylic acid polyelectrolytes differed from those of previously reported monocarboxylic polyelectrolytes. The complexation of polyelectrolytes with ionic surfactants is driven primarily by electrostatic interactions for ionized chains and dispersion interactions for unionized chains. Anionic chains undergo notable conformational transitiones upon adsorption onto oppositely charged micelles. The adsorption site of the polyelectrolyte on the micelle surface depends on the chain\'s charge density. In an oppositely charged surfactant solution, the anionic chain effectively acts as a polymeric counter-ion by displacing monovalent counter-ions into the bulk solution. Interpolymer complexation becomes more challenging at higher organic solvent compositions. The swelling behavior of the interpolymer complex was observed with increasing cosolvent concentrations by measuring the solvent accessible surface area of the entire complex.','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/dgx-sepk-pqb','seminar25-09-2024 04:44','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar25-09-2024 04:44',1,'2024-09-25 04:44:07','Active'),(1319,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','From Realizing Room Temperature Dipolar Excitons in van der Waals Heterostructures','Dr. Abhishek Misra','Dr. Abhishek Misra obtained his Ph.D in micro electronics from IIT Bombay, where he was the recipient of the best Ph.D thesis award.

In urban areas, VOCs and their derivatives, such as ozone and peroxyacetyl nitrates, constitute a significant portion of secondary pollutants. The oxidation of these trace gases by OH radicals and Cl atoms is crucial due to their rapid reactions and high atmospheric concentrations, which facilitate the removal of VOCs. To elucidate their atmospheric chemistry, laboratory studies employing techniques such as pulsed laser photolysis coupled with laser-induced fluorescence, relative rate measurements, and computational studies are essential. These methods provide kinetic data that allow for the determination of VOC lifetimes and the calculation of radiative forcing, global warming potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, ozone depletion potential, and acidification potential. These parameters are notably significant for unsaturated, oxygenated, and halogenated VOCs. This seminar will focus on the photo-oxidation reactions of chlorinated alkanes (C4),2 alkylamines (C4), ethers (C4),3 fluorinated diketones (C5), and unsaturated ketones (C6) with OH radicals and Cl atoms.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

In addition, the quantum fluctuations associated with the scalar fields driving inflation can induce the primordial perturbations that are responsible for the anisotropies in the CMB. At the end of inflation, the scalar field(s) oscillate around the minima of the potentials, transferring their energy to the particles that constitute the standard model in a process known as reheating. The scalar perturbations generated during inflation are strongly constrained over large scales by the observations of the CMB. However, on small scales, the constraints are considerably weaker. In contrast, the tensor perturbations are yet to be observed over large scales. Whereas over small scales, the pulsar timing arrays have recently detected a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, which may have a primordial origin.\r\n\r\nI will begin the talk with a brief introduction to inflation and reheating. Next, I will discuss ultra slow roll inflation which is relevant in the context of the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and the generation of scalar-induced secondary GWs. I will explain the manner in which the dynamics of inflation during the later stages together with the phase of reheating can be probed by the observations of primary and secondary GWs by ongoing and forthcoming GW observatories. Specifically, I will show that the spectrum of scalar-induced secondary GWs generated during reheating can fit the NANOGrav 15-year data better with a large Bayes factor when compared to the astrophysical scenario involving the mergers of supermassive binary black holes. Thereafter, I will discuss the effect of quantum memory burden on the evaporation of PBHs and its implications for the production of dark matter from the evaporation of PBHs. In the later part of my talk, I will consider the three-point cross-correlation involving both the scalar and tensor modes. In the squeezed limit wherein the wavelength of one of the three modes is much larger than the other two, the three-point functions are expected to be expressed entirely in terms of the two-point functions, a relation often referred to as the consistency condition. I will discuss the validity of the consistency relation of the scalar-tensor-tensor three-point correlation in pure ultra slow roll inflation. Further, I will discuss the loop contributions to the scalar power spectrum arising from higher-order interactions in a scenario that involves a brief phase of ultra slow roll inflation sandwiched between two slow roll regimes. Lastly, I will present a geometrical proof of the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem which states that any spacetime with net positive expansion must be geodesically incomplete. I will conclude with a brief summary.\r\n\r\nThis talk will be based on the following publications and preprints:\r\n1.  W. H. Kinney, S. Maity, L.

In the wireless context, more specifically, in Wi-Fi networks, when a frame is sent over a given bandwidth/channel and with a given MCS, then, success or failure of the frame transmission permits us to estimate the approximate quality of the channel and the success/failure status at other bandwidth/channel and MCS configuration choices as well. For example, if a frame transmitted at MCS ð‘— is successfully received at an instant, it is fair to expect that the frame will be successfully received at MCS ð‘–, for all ð‘– < ð‘—. A similar commentary can also be made for 20/40/80 MHz dynamic bandwidth transmissions possible in the latest Wi-Fi standards. The correlation in performance among the different action choices permits one to develop efficient resource allocation strategies for the wireless context. In the context of multi armed bandit algorithms, the correlation will help us minimize exploration and regret and present an efficient strategy. In this work, we first present an application of the Min-UCB algorithm (Manonmayee Bharatula and Ramaiyan (2023)) for the problem of joint selection of MCS and bandwidth selection. We show that the Min-UCB exploits the correlation among the arms, presents a better UCB index, and eventually outperforms state-of-the-art bandit algorithms with a smaller cumulative regret. Further, we extend the study to a problem of RU allocation in IEEE 802.11ax OFDMA frames. Here, we propose a novel algorithm, Min-UCB+, that leverages the correlation based on the average performance of the arms (as against the per packet bounds pursued in CUCB and Min-UCB). Once again, we seek a better upper confidence bound for the correlated framework and combine the different bounds to present our novel algorithm. We also motivate the design for our proposed algorithm. Finally, using simulations, we evaluate the performance of Min-UCB+ algorithm and compare it with state-of-the-art algorithms, such as UCB with bounded rewards and CUCB, across different scenarios.','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/ptp-xhhv-hii','','',1,'2024-09-25 10:44:17','Active'),(1324,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','MetaFix: Semi-Supervised Model Agnostic Meta-Learning using Consistency Regularization','Ms. Solarica Palit, CS21D007','Ph.D. Research Scholar','Dr. Sutanu Chakraborti - DC Chair,\r\nDr. C Chandra Sekhar - Guide,\r\nDC Members:\r\nDr. Arun Rajkumar - DA,\r\nDr. Mitesh Khapra - DA,\r\nDr. Kaushik Mitra - EE.','Computer Science and Engineering','2024/10/03 15:00','2024-10-03','','A M Turing Hall (SSB 334, Second Floor)','The goal of few-shot classification (FSC) is to use only a small number of labeled data points (typically 1 to 5) per class to train a classification model.

In this work, we propose MetaFix, a semi-supervised model agnostic meta-learning (MAML)  framework designed to boost the performance of semi-supervised FSC. To leverage unlabeled samples, the proposed method incorporates consistency regularization and uses pseudo-labeling to enhance the performance of semi-supervised FSC. Our approach also effectively utilizes unlabeled data both in the inner and outer loops of MAML algorithm, resulting in more robust and informative meta-learned model parameters. Additionally, it effectively mitigates the effects of misclassification and noise-influenced data since it employs consistency regularization, which preserves semantics. We study the performance of MetaFix for the case where the unlabeled dataset belongs to the same dataset as the labeled data in each episode.

During the fractionation of biomass to produce second-generation biofuels, lignin-rich fractions are generated as a side-stream. Due to the highly recalcitrant nature of lignin, it is usually burnt in bio-refineries for the generation of energy, thus underutilizing this valuable resource. With the development of new technologies, there have been attempts to utilize lignin to produce value-added products. This is achieved by recovering, depolymerizing, and converting lignin to fuels and chemicals by a combination of chemo-catalysis and enzymatic bioconversion.  \r\nIn this work, a metabolically-engineered strain of Pseudomonas taiwanensis VLB120 was developed to efficiently utilize some of the synthetic lignin-related aromatics (LRAs). This includes LRAs such as p-coumarate, p-hydroxy benzoate, ferulate, caffeate, and vanillate. The wild type strain was not able to utilize the non-native substrates p-coumarate, ferulate, and caffeate. So, the strain was equipped with ferulic operon genes; fcs, ech, and vdh by genomic integration, thus enabling P. taiwanensis VLB120 to grow on these non-native substrates. The strain was further engineered using adaptive laboratory evolution to enhance its tolerance towards these non-native substrates. This resulted in strains with better phenotype, showing at least 2-3-fold enhancement in specific growth rates. Whole-genome sequencing of the evolved strains revealed several mutations in various genes, e.g. those coding for transporter proteins, aromatic catabolic proteins, hypothetical proteins etc., that led to tolerance enhancement. From these results, two key mutations were targeted for reverse engineering to develop strains with enhanced tolerance. The first target was a gene coding for a cation/acetate symporter, actP and the other target gene was paaA coding for a phenyl acetyl-CoA oxygenase. Knocking out actP gene and overexpression of paaA gene were found to have positive effect on tolerance enhancement. The best growing strain was metabolically-engineered for rhamnolipid production, by the genomic integration of essential genes rhlA and rhlB. Synthetic LRAs were initially investigated as substrates for rhamnolipid production using the engineered strains. Among the investigated LRAs, p-coumarate produced the highest titer of 0.5 g/L. In synthetic mixture of LRAs, a maximum of 0.3 g/L was achieved using the engineered strain. \r\nIn the second part of the work, all the three components of corncob biomass were valorized for rhamnolipid production. Sugar-rich hydrolysate obtained from enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated corncob, that was rich in glucose and xylose, was fermented to produce 1.4 g/L of rhamnolipid. Chemical depolymerization of lignin-rich fraction, obtained from pre-treated and enzymatically hydrolyzed corncob, was subjected to base catalysis. This resulted in p-coumarate-rich depolymerized lignin with minimal levels of other aromatics. Rhamnolipid production was also demonstrated using depolymerized lignin from corncob achieving a maximum of 0.8 g/L in batch bioreactor cultivation.\r\nAn integrated biorefinery approach utilizing a mixed stream of depolymerized lignin and sugar-rich hydrolysate, produced 650 mg/L rhamnolipid. As a proof of concept, this work has demonstrated the complete bioconversion of all the three components of corncob biomass (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) to rhamnolipid using the engineered P. taiwanensis VLB120.\r\n','BT OFFICE','btoffice@smail.iitm.ac.in','Publications: 1.

Quantum error correction plays a pivotal role in protecting quantum information from noise. Most quantum codes are designed to correct for Pauli-type noise, which then makes them capable of correcting arbitrary noise [1]. However, if one has information about the structure of the noise, one can perform quantum error correction efficiently with fewer resources by designing codes tailored for that particular noise [2]. Such codes are known as the noise-adapted quantum codes [3].\r\n\r\nIn this seminar, I will discuss our recent work on constructing noise-adapted quantum codes for amplitude-damping (AD) noise [4, 5], which is one of the most realistic noise models in superconducting transmon qubits. I will present a family of quantum codes for AD noise that is optimal with respect to overheads and outperforms existing codes to tackle AD noise in terms of entanglement fidelity. Additionally, I will discuss a quantum error correction framework which is a generalization of the well known Knill-Laflamme conditions [6]. As our proposed family of quantum codes are derived using these new quantum error correction conditions, the recovery procedure is not deterministic but probabilistic. Finally, I will present quantum codes encoded in higher-excitation states leading to bosonic codes that can correct AD noise.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] Raymond Laflamme, Cesar Miquel, Juan Pablo Paz, and Wojciech Hubert Zurek, Perfect quantum error correcting code; Phys.

In this talk, we delve into these two essential aspects. Firstly, we aim to identify optimal strategies for minimizing delays and maximizing customer satisfaction, thereby enhancing system performance. Secondly, we employ mathematical frameworks to model the evolution of public opinion and study its behavior, providing insights into managing online perception effectively. \r\n\r\nThe first part of this talk is motivated by the delay-sensitivity of recent applications, including e-commerce services, quantum communication, and multimedia streaming. The effective system performance in these applications is known to exhibit nonlinear dependencies on the delay. In this part, we address the problem of maximizing the long-term average reward in a single-server queuing system, where the reward obtained for a job is a non-increasing, possibly nonlinear function of its sojourn time (delay). Although the goal of optimizing the total sojourn time is well-studied in the literature, optimizing a nonlinear function of the sojourn times remains unexplored to the best of our knowledge. We consider two arrival models --- the first is a `burst arrival\' model, wherein all jobs arrive at the server simultaneously. We show that shortest job first (SJF) maximizes the average reward for any monotonic function of the sojourn times. In the second setting, jobs arrive according to some stochastic process with i.i.d. service requirements. This setting is significantly more challenging to analyze, and identifying an optimal discipline remains elusive. We introduce a new service discipline, shortest predicted sojourn time (SPST), and provide analytical guarantees under specific settings. Numerically, we demonstrate that SPST outperforms well-known disciplines across multiple settings.\r\n\r\nIn the next part of this talk, we explore a recently proposed framework in opinion dynamics, stochastic bounded confidence (SBC) dynamics, to model the evolution of opinions in social networks. SBC dynamics generalize the classical opinion update models, linear graph-based dynamics and bounded confidence dynamics, capturing the inherent stochasticity and noise in real-life interactions. The asymptotic analysis of SBC dynamics in prior work is a significant analytical contribution. However, such analyses do not shed light on the finite-time behavior of the dynamics, which is often crucial, e.g., in marketing campaigns, election canvassing, etc. In this part of the talk, we present the first finite-time analysis of the existing SBC dynamics. The finite-time analysis of SBC presents some technical challenges mainly due to inherent nonlinearity and stochasticity. We first characterize the finite-time behavior of SBC dynamics of two agents and then extend our analysis to a bistar social graph representing bipartisan democracies and commercial duopolies. Moreover, finite-time analysis of SBC requires us to develop concentration bounds for asymptotically zero-drift unbounded jump Markov processes, which, to our knowledge, have not been studied before. We derive high probability bounds for the opinion difference between any two agents and demonstrate a strong concentration of opinion difference around zero under the exact conditions that ensure the asymptotic stability of the dynamics. We also provide numerical experiments to compare with our analytical results.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web conference linkhttps://meet.google.com/vqo-gxdy-fhs',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-09-27 07:18:21','Active'),(1329,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','THE 21st CENTURY LEAN-AGILE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS: THE NEXUS BETWEEN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY','Mr Allan Rodrigues','Allan Rodrigues pre-maturely retired from the Indian Navy in 1994 after serving over 20\r\nyears.

To achieve this the GSCs link all value activities from the birth to the death (or\r\ndisposal) of a product by mitigating the inherent uncertainty of demand, and by managing the conflict\r\nbetween the low cost at the birth of the product upstream, with the agility to fulfill high demand nearer\r\nthe customer downstream, in innovative ways. Production is managed in networks of super-specialised\r\ndesign, equipment/parts manufacturers using contract manufacturers, delay assembly, and value-added\r\nresellers.Â Â \r\nÂ \r\nThe construct requires all GSC partners to share critical information and knowledge at their supply-value\r\ninterfaces. Strategic alliances between partners ensure that equitable value is obtained across their value\r\nboundaries. Unfortunately, asymmetries in knowledge sharing often result in a conflict between the\r\nGlobal Supply Chains, and the Strategic Value chains (SVCs), leading to the rise of large â€˜Alpha Malesâ€™ or\r\ngiant entities who exert absolute dominance over their supply-value chains to the detriment of small\r\nbusinesses, smaller nations and often with a deleterious effect on sustainability.Â  Additionally, the\r\nerstwhile low-cost production economies have themselves begun to migrate into creating high-end\r\nproducts and stake a claim for a larger share of value.\r\nThe Pandemic in 2019 followed by the Suez/Panama crisis, and wars in Ukraine/Yemen have had a catastrophic effect on the GSCs creating imbalances in container traffic with congestions at the GSC transport hubs and ports. Governments and even the UN have sought to rein in the power of the large global entities to make these GSCs more resilient against these events in the first instant, but also to pressurize the GSCs to be more inclusive in ways that benefit not just the global giants but the smaller entities as well, and to enforce sustainability targets on all GSC partners.Â  The new post-pandemic GSC constructs, seek to use high-tech innovation upstream, designed around digital factories based on Industry 4.0 concepts and IIOT, AI-enabled predictive analytics, and even blockchains to drive the lean-agile construct to be low-cost and yet be able to seamlessly ramp up fulfillment where required.\r\nConversely, there is an equal need for the business end to use broad ideation funnels to drive radical innovations in strategy and paradigm shifts in positioning, process, and financing to compete and create wealth.\r\nÂ There is a need for both ends of the GSC construct, from the proponents of technology on the one hand, and those who manage the operations-business models on the other, to understand the innards of each otherâ€™s contributions to value. Solutions will need to be crafted at the granular level, at the very birth of each system, rather than being overlaid on the top.

Both Al and Cu are earth-abundant metals, with substantial absorption cross-sections in UV, visible, and some parts of the near-infrared region (~300â€“1100 nm). This makes these nanoparticles useful in solar water heating applications. The aqueous synthesis approach, which yields oxide-based nanoparticles, is used since it is scalable and eco-friendly. The effects of particle loading between 0.025â€“0.1 wt % in DI water, used as a nanofluid, are tested under an infrared source. At 0.075 wt %, a 14â€“16% enhancement in the saturation temperature is obtained, indicating a ~15% increase in heating kinetic constants. The scattering and absorption cross-sections for the Al-Cu-oxide-based nanoparticle system were determined, and the peak scattering cross-section was found to occur at a wavelength of 728 nm for a particle size of 50 nm. The values are used to solve the energy balance equations, predicting a maximum temperature of 347.5 K for a volume of 500 ml water over a 12-hour solar heating time period.

Analysing this type of fracture is complex due to the involvement of hydro-mechanical coupling. Among various FEM-based numerical techniques, the intrinsic interface pore pressure cohesive element (PPCE) method is straightforward to implement. However, this method requires pre-positioning the PPCEs into the mesh along the anticipated fracture path, reducing its flexibility for models with complex scenarios where the fracture path cannot be predicted a priori. To address this issue, a mesh post-processing technique is required, where PPCEs are placed around the bulk elements of the mesh, allowing the fracture to pass through them as it evolves. This research presents a technique that employs higher-order triangular elements for domain discretization, along with linear PPCEs, to more effectively capture the fracture path and hydro-mechanical coupling. Several validation analyses have been conducted, showing that this technique is robust and effectively represents fracture propagation. These comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the method\'s ability to capture the intricate details of fracture evolution with a high degree of precision. The mesh post processing ability to place PPCEs around bulk elements ensures that the technique remains flexible and applicable in complex scenarios. This enhanced flexibility, highlights the techniqueâ€™s reliability and precision in modelling fluid-driven fracturing in saturated rock mass.\r\n\r\n','R.

Our study addresses this challenge\r\nby emphasizing the importance of employing advanced techniques to measure aerosol hygroscopicity\r\nand phase transition behavior, offering insights from field campaigns and laboratory experiments\r\naimed at characterizing the water uptake characteristics of atmospheric aerosol particles.\r\nUnderstanding the physical and chemical properties of these particles is crucial for advancing our\r\ncomprehension of their role in local to global climate dynamics.\r\nAerosol water uptake, or hygroscopicity, plays a pivotal role in regulating Earth\'s radiation budget\r\nand influencing cloud formation and precipitation through both direct and indirect effects. To\r\ninvestigate the mass-based hygroscopicity of atmospheric aerosols in sub-saturated regions more\r\nprecisely, this research utilizes the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) technique. Unlike size-based\r\nstudies, which only reveal changes after the deliquescence relative humidity (DRH) of the particle is\r\nreached, monitoring mass changes provides continuous insights into aerosol behavior as it uptakes\r\nwater.\r\nSample aerosol particles from diverse environments (polluted vs. cleaner) were collected on PTFE\r\nfilters using the Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor (MOUDI) and uniformly transferred onto\r\nQCM sensors. Continuous monitoring of mass changes across a wide range of relative humidity\r\n\r\nvalues (2â€“93%) enabled the calculation of the mass-based hygroscopicity parameter, Îº. The derived Îº\r\nvalues hold promise for informing the development of effective parameterizations in prognostic\r\nmodeling, offering valuable insights into the behavior of atmospheric aerosols across various\r\nenvironmental conditions. Our research underscores the critical role of advanced instrumentation in\r\nenhancing our understanding of aerosol dynamics and their implications for climate processes.','R.

It can be attributed mostly to the fabrication sensitivity of gratings to commercial foundry processes and the gap in design optimization combining both footprint and performance to some extent. There have been multitude of demonstrations on first-order Fabry-PÃ©rot resonators investigated for narrowband transmission and notch filters, sensors, dispersion compensation circuits and few reports on modulator and non-linear photonics-based applications. However, higher order resonators based on DBRs which can be simpler alternatives to coupled ring resonators towards applications such as RF photonic filters, wavelength division (de)multiplexers etc. are relatively very less explored. We will discuss the design and demonstration of 4th and 5th order passive resonant filters in an SOI rib waveguide structure, fabricated with the in-house CMOS compatible silicon photonics technology. These filters exhibit nearly lossless, flat-top response (ripple < 1-dB) and large out-of-band rejection (>40 dB) along with a maximum shape factor of 0.9 without any active tuning operating in the L band of communication.\r\n\r\nNext, we will discuss a novel design of a compact tunable resonance filter with a highly extinguished and ultra-broad out-of-band rejection. The proposed device is designed for Fabry-PÃ©rot resonant transmission in an SOI rib waveguide with two identically apodized distributed grating structures. The device design parameters are optimized by CMT-aided-TMM method for a low insertion loss singly-resonant transmission peak at a desired wavelength. A device length of as low as ~ 35 Âµm exhibits a rejection band as large as ~ 60 nm with an extinction of ~ 40 dB with respect to the resonant wavelength peak at Î»r ~ 1550 nm (FWHM ~ 80 pm, IL ~ 2 dB). The experimental results have been shown to be closely matching our theoretical simulation and modelling results. The resonance peak has been tuned with the help of integrated metal microheaters near the cavity at a rate of 96 pm per mW of consumed thermal power with switching time ~ 5 Âµs. As a significant potential application not yet demonstrated in literature to the best of our knowledge, on-chip ASE noise suppression associated with an amplified pump wavelength has been demonstrated which can be investigated further for large-scale integrated quantum photonic circuits. The demonstrated device can also be explored further for many other applications such as modulation, add-drop multiplexing, sensing etc.\r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web conference linkmeet.google.com/jsw-uwpj-kgj',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-09-28 06:30:27','Active'),(1334,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','Scope of establishing the single- and multiphoton fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) technique at IIT Madras','Prof  Prem B Bisht','Prof Prem Bisht is a faculty in the Department of Physics and also a key member in the Biosensing group within the CoE on Healthcare','Professor, Department of Physics, IIT Madras\r\nCoE on Healthcare - Biosensing vertical, IIT Madras','Electrical Engineering','2024/09/30 16:00','2024-09-30','yes','CSD 308','Sensing/imaging of nano-micro systems in healthcare require technologies with higher sensitivity and resolution, faster response, deep-imaging capability, and nano- scale chemical fingerprints.

A novel integrated furnace-microwave process was employed for synthesizing activated carbon, which showed superior adsorption of 4-Nitrophenol (4NP) when compared with conventional sole furnace treatment and direct microwave activation processes. This research evaluates the efficacy of phosphoric acid and potassium hydroxide activating agents. The acid activated carbon (AAC) and base activated carbon (BAC) exhibited adsorption capacities of 395 mg/g and 576 mg/g respectively. Characterization of AAC and BAC was performed using SEM, BET, EDX, TGA, FTIR, and point of zero charge analyses. BAC had a BET surface area of 1319 mÂ²/g while it was 1027 m2/g for AAC. \r\nAn I-optimal design of experiments strategy was used to tune the process conditions involved in AAC and BAC syntheses. This work further explored the practical application of AAC and BAC in treating real industrial wastewater. Continuous packed-column experiments with BAC demonstrated a higher breakthrough time for the industrial effluent, underscoring this adsorbent\'s potential for continuous wastewater treatment.\r\nTo further enhance pollutant degradation, ozonation, an advanced oxidation process, was integrated with adsorption. The catalytic ozonation process, when carried out in an airlift reactor (ALR) exhibited synergistic results. Catalytic ozonation in the ALR exhibited superior performance when compared to conventional semi-batch and bubble column reactors. Optimization of the catalytic ozonation process in ALR, by tuning BAC dosage, pH, and ozone concentration, further improved the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal efficiency. The catalytic ozonation process also achieved a 95% COD removal from industrial dye bath effluent. The reusability of BAC in multiple cycles without regeneration was demonstrated for dye bath effluent treatment. Intermediates produced during catalytic ozonation were identified using GC-MS analyses.\r\nThis research demonstrates the utility of waste thornbush as a perennial and economical precursor for high-capacity adsorbents provided the process conditions involved in carbonization, activation and adsorption are tuned to their optimal settings. In addition to developing high-capacity adsorbents, the reactor configuration in which they are applied, also plays a key role in enhancing the removal rates of the pollutants.    \r\nKeywords: Activated carbon, Prosopis juliflora, Furnace-Microwave activation, Design of experiments, Industrial wastewater, Adsorption, Catalytic ozonation, Airlift reactor','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web conference linkhttps://meet.google.com/xca-axca-seh',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-09-30 06:30:11','Active'),(1337,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\'\'THE ROLE OF STARTUPS IN ACHIEVING HEALTH EQUITY\'\'','Ms. AARTHI RAMACHANDRAN, Roll No. MS20D300','Ph.D. SCHOLAR - IDRP','Prof. A.

According to the World Health Organization, equity refers to the absence of unjust, avoidable, or remediable differences among groups of people, whether defined by social, economic, demographic, or geographic factors, or by other forms of inequality such as gender, ethnicity, disability, or sexual orientation. Achieving healthcare equity requires ensuring that all individuals can access health services to their fullest potential while also addressing disparities in health outcomes. Addressing health inequities demands focused efforts from governments, development partners, civil society, the private sector, and nonprofit organizations to implement effective interventions and ensure fairness in decision-making processes. The United Nations highlights the role of startups and entrepreneurship in building a more sustainable society by improving health (United Nations, 2015). This underscores a significant link between health equity and startups, which this study seeks to investigate. A startup is a new venture in its early stages of operation, often small, agile, and dedicated to developing innovative solutions to various problems. Using diabetes as a case study, this research focuses on how healthcare startups contribute to advancing health equity. The study aims to identify the impacts generated by these startups that support health equity, while also examining how healthcare entrepreneurs operate within the healthcare sector and balance economic value creation with health impact. These questions are essential because healthcare startups often encounter tension between two core objectives: generating health impact and achieving financial success. Exploring the motivations of healthcare founders and how they balance these dual goals is crucial, as their contributions to health equity are influenced by their core objectives. The study will also collect evidence from beneficiaries or service users to demonstrate startups\' contributions to health equity. As an emerging field, there has been little exploration of this topic, particularly within the context of Indian healthcare startups. Our preliminary results, based on qualitative interviews with 11 founders of diabetes-focused healthcare startups, offer insights into how startups contribute to health equity and the motivations and strategies they employ. The study reveals how these startups balance hybrid goalsâ€”combining economic and social value creationâ€”while addressing gaps in the healthcare system by building financially sustainable ventures, products, and services. Our research shows that these healthcare startups are improving access to healthcare through their services, contributing to dimensions of access such as affordability, availability, service accessibility, health promotion, preventive care, and effective access to primary care. We identified the coupling motivations driving healthcare entrepreneurs: 1) social motivation, 2) economic motivation, and 3) integrated motivation. The findings also reveal that these startups use strategies to balance both social and financial value, particularly through 1) Market Hybrid Models and 2) Blending Models.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Healthcare entrepreneurship, healthcare startups, health equity, access to healthcare, balancing act, motivations.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','RESEARCH PROPOSAL SEMINAR-web conference link',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-09-30 06:30:16','Active'),(1338,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK TO ASSESS PROJECT PERFORMANCE IN AUTOMATED CONSTRUCTION','Mr. SUNDARARAMAN K , Roll No CE15D012','PH.D Scholar ','Dr. Benny Raphael - Guide, Dr. Ashwin Mahalingam - DC Member, Dr. Arun Menon - DC Member , \r\nDr. V .

In the wake of globalisation, with the growth in urbanisation and the rise of middle class, Tamil film stars have reinvented themselves in keeping with the audience tastes and adapted to the digital transition. My research examines four select stars from contemporary Tamil cinema who cater to the globalised audience : Vijay, Ajith, Dhanush and Vijay Sethupathy.\r\n\r\nThis research employs the theoretical framework drawn from star studies and gender studies to study the representation of various categories of hero figures in film and their evolution under the changing cultural norms in globalised Tamil society.

My research began with an in-depth examination of the fragmentation dynamics of isolated camphor molecules, allowing insights into the molecular rearrangement and subsequent dissociation [1]. These initial studies laid the foundation for subsequent investigations into cluster fragmentation, particularly focusing on H2O, D2O, O2 and RbI clusters embedded within helium nanodroplets. Helium nanodroplets, providing a cold and inert medium, serve as a near-ideal platform for studying reactive intermediates and complex fragmentation processes under minimal perturbation [2-5]. By forming these molecular clusters in He nanodroplets, I was able to explore their ionization and fragmentation pathways, revealing the role of the helium matrix in stabilizing complexes and influencing relaxation mechanisms [6]. A key aspect of this research involves time-resolved spectroscopy of Interatomic Coulombic Decay (ICD) in alkali metal (Na, K) doped helium nanodroplets. These time-resolved measurements uncovered fast ICD and slow ICD dynamics, shedding light on energy transfer and electron decay processes in weakly interacting systems. The results of these studies contribute to a broader understanding of molecular relaxation mechanisms, with implications for both fundamental cluster physics and potential applications in radiation damage in biological systems [7,8].\r\n\r\n[1].

Recent works have noted that parametric models which assume  d dimensional node representations can effectively model intransitive tournaments . However, nothing is known about the structure of the class of tournaments that arise out of any fixed d dimensional representations. In this work, we develop a novel theory for understanding parametric tournament representations. Our first contribution is to structurally characterize the class of tournaments that arise out of d dimensional representations. We do this by showing that these tournament classes have forbidden configurations which must necessarily be a union of flip classes, a novel way to partition the set of all tournaments. We further characterize rank 2 tournaments completely by showing that the associated forbidden flip class contains just 2 tournaments. Specifically, we show that the rank 2 tournaments are equivalent to locally-transitive tournaments. This insight allows us to show that the minimum feedback arc set problem on this tournament class can be solved using the standard Quicksort procedure. For a general rank d tournament class, we show that the flip class associated with a coned-doubly regular tournament of size O(d^2) must be a forbidden configuration. To answer a dual question we show a lower bound of Omega(\\sqrt{n}) on the minimum dimension needed to represent all tournaments on n nodes. For any given tournament, we  show a novel upper bound on the smallest representation dimension that depends on the least size of the number of unique nodes in any feedback arc set of the flip class associated with a tournament. We show how our results also shed light on the upper bound of sign-rank of matrices.

My research began with an in-depth examination of the fragmentation dynamics of isolated camphor molecules, allowing insights into the molecular rearrangement and subsequent dissociation [1]. These initial studies laid the foundation for subsequent investigations into cluster fragmentation, particularly focusing on H2O, D2O, O2 and RbI clusters embedded within helium nanodroplets. Helium nanodroplets, providing a cold and inert medium, serve as a near-ideal platform for studying reactive intermediates and complex fragmentation processes under minimal perturbation [2-5]. By forming these molecular clusters in He nanodroplets, I was able to explore their ionization and fragmentation pathways, revealing the role of the helium matrix in stabilizing complexes and influencing relaxation mechanisms [6]. A key aspect of this research involves time-resolved spectroscopy of Interatomic Coulombic Decay (ICD) in alkali metal (Na, K) doped helium nanodroplets. These time-resolved measurements uncovered fast ICD and slow ICD dynamics, shedding light on energy transfer and electron decay processes in weakly interacting systems. The results of these studies contribute to a broader understanding of molecular relaxation mechanisms, with implications for both fundamental cluster physics and potential applications in radiation damage in biological systems [7,8].\r\n\r\n[1].

The rotation distinctly affects the transport phenomena at various scales, ranging from the astrophysical scales, e.g., rotating accretion disks, stellar and planetary convection flows, to the terrestrial technology scales, e.g., aero-engine nose-cones, gas turbine engines, turbomachinery, spinning projectiles, wheels,  process intensifiers, etc. The rotating boundary layer transitions add further complexity to these systems as they induce coherent spiral vortices which grow, interact, and lead to the turbulence onset. We consider rotating cones/disks to be a simplified model of three-dimensional boundary layers to study the mechanisms of turbulence onset caused by the rotational effects. The turbulence onset on rotating cones originates from the underlying competitions between the centrifugal, crossflow, viscous-Coriolis, and absolute instabilities---their relative dominance varies based on the flow parameters and cone geometry. This talk will show the recent findings about the rotating cone and disk boundary layer instability and turbulence onset, and a new scaling law. The results are based on the measurements using two and three-dimensional particle image velocimetry (PIV) and infrared thermography (IRT), coupled with modal decomposition techniques, e.g., POD, sPOD.

Historically, Tamil film stars like MGR, Sivaji Ganesan, Rajinikanth and Vijayakanth are well known for their association with the regionâ€™s politics and also shaping the Tamil cultural identity over the years. In the wake of globalisation, with the growth in urbanisation and the rise of middle class, Tamil film stars have reinvented themselves in keeping with the audience tastes and adapted to the digital transition. My research examines four select stars from contemporary Tamil cinema who cater to the globalised audience : Vijay, Ajith, Dhanush and Vijay Sethupathy.\r\n\r\nThis research employs the theoretical framework drawn from star studies and gender studies to study the representation of various categories of hero figures in film and their evolution under the changing cultural norms in globalised Tamil society. For that purpose, while this research uses the theories of stardom by Richard Dyer, it also applies the concepts of \'Cine-politics\' by Madhava Prasad, \'Melodrama\' by Ravi Vasudevan, \'Cinema of interruptions\' by Lalitha Gopalan, \'The Mass film\' by SV Srinivas, Gender performativity theories by Judith Butler, Fredric Jameson\'s concept of postmodernism and the theories of globalisation by Arjun Appadurai and Anthony Giddens.\r\n\r\nTo study the stars, this research will apply textual analysis to read the starâ€™s on-screen masculine performativity in film texts and use multimodal discourse analysis of select news materials and digital materials to understand the verbal, visual and aural signs embedded in a â€˜star textâ€™.

The human handâ€™s dexterity, a distinct feature compared to other species, allows it to handle objects ranging from delicate to heavy. This dexterity relies on the precise coordination of fingertip forces, automatically adjusted according to the object\'s size, surface, orientation, and weight. However, aging leads to diminished neuromotor function, such as reduced tactile sensation and muscle strength, causing older adults to apply higher grip forces and experience challenges in finger force coordination. Finger force synergies describe this coordination, reflecting both mechanical properties and neural modulation by the CNS. In addition, corticomuscular coherence (CMC) reflects the connection between the cerebral cortex and muscles, with older adults exhibiting reduced CMC during sustained muscle contractions. Moreover, the Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults (HAROLD) theory suggests less lateralized brain activity in older adults, though some studies propose a greater reliance on the left hemisphere for motor tasks, possibly due to compensatory mechanisms. While research on age-related changes in motor control has explored isolated factors like grip force modulation, finger force synergies, and EEGâ€“EMG coherence, limited studies examine how these factors interact during multi-digit tasks like grasping. This study aimed to compare neural and behavioral features between older and younger adults during a handle-grasping and lifting task under two conditions: a fixed thumb platform and a free thumb platform. Tasks were performed separately with each hand in a randomized order. The findings of the study revealed that older individuals showed no substantial differences in EEG band power or synergy indices across task conditions, while younger participants displayed higher EEG beta band power and synergy indices in the fixed condition, reflecting greater task-specific neural and behavioral variation. This suggests a reduced ability to adapt in older individuals, evident in both EEG band power and finger force coordination. Furthermore, corticomuscular coherence (CMC) in the older group did not differ between tasks, unlike in the younger group, where clear differences were observed. Older adults also exhibited lower EEG band power, finger force synergy, and beta band CMC during the fixed condition, indicating reduced neural activation and coordination, consistent with previous findings. Increased hand asymmetry was observed in older adults, primarily due to poorer performance of the non-dominant hand, contrasting with the younger group, which showed balanced hemispheric activation and coordinated finger force in both hands. These results suggest that older adults display consistent performance across tasks but have reduced neural activation and coordination, especially in the non-dominant hand. Future research on neural and behavioral features in dexterous tasks will provide more definitive insights.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web conference linkOnline meeting link - https://meet.google.com/rtr-ajor-nfd',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-02 06:30:07','Active'),(1354,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','â€œPhoto-oxidation reactions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) initiated by OH radicals and Cl atoms: kinetics and implications\"','Mr. Fredy Joy (CY18D037)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide- Professor Rajakumar B\r\nDC Chairperson- Professor Pradeep T, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/10/03 16:00','2024-10-03','yes','CB-310, Chemistry Seminar Hall','Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) constitute a major component of the trace gases present in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere. The sources for these include both natural and anthropogenic activities. The fate of chemical species released into the Earthâ€™s atmosphere are mostly driven by their reactions with the highly reactive albeit short-lived radical species present in the atmosphere. Of the many such oxidants, hydroxyl radicals (OH) and chlorine (Cl) atoms are mainly responsible for the degradation of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) due to their abundance and reactivity. Degradation of VOCs leads to the generation of secondary pollutants such as ozone, peroxy-alkyl nitrates, and secondary organic aerosols. Kinetic and mechanistic studies of such reactions are necessary to assess the significance of these reactions and their contribution to pollution.\r\nThe photo-oxidation reactions of 1.) tert-butyl chloride, 2.) isobutyl chloride, 3.) vinyl trifluoroacetate and allyl trifluoroacetate and 4.) 2,3-pentanedione with OH radicals and Cl atoms were studied to gain insights into their kinetics and to assess the impact of their emissions to the atmosphere.\r\nThe temperature-dependent kinetics for the reactions with OH radicals were studied using the pulsed laser photolysis laser-induced fluorescence (PLP-LIF) technique while the reactions with Cl atoms were studied using the relative rate (RR) method. In addition to this, the site-specific kinetics of these reactions were investigated using conventional transition-state theory (TST) and canonical variational transition-state theory with small-curvature tunnelling (CVT/SCT).\r\nThe potential influence of these reactions on the atmosphere were also estimated using parameters such as lifetimes, radiative forcing (RF) and global warming potentials (GWPs).\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

Biomedical data is divided into four main categories: Nano (molecular analysis), Micro (cellular analysis), Meso (tissue analysis), and Macro (organ analysis). Our research focuses on macro-scale medical data, including computed tomography (CT) scans, ultrasound (US) scans, and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Advanced imaging techniques like CT and US scans offer detailed insights into organ structure and function at different spatial resolutions, providing valuable information about anatomical and pathological changes. Similarly, signal acquisition methods such as EEG capture the brain\'s electrical activities, offering dynamic information on physiological functions and aiding in detecting abnormalities. Medical data often contain artefacts, indirect signatures, and co-varying factors from scanning devices. Therefore, preprocessing the data is crucial to highlight regions of interest in images and improve feature representation in signals before modelling them for specific applications. Our research focuses on developing various preprocessing pipelines for spatiotemporal medical data. These preprocessing techniques enhance spatiotemporal data modelling using ML/DL models and provide clinicians with an improved and interpretable hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIn this seminar, We will discuss our recent work on Ultrasound and EEG signals.

The bitumen acts as a binder and holds the aggregate particles together. It also ensures that the mixture can resist tension. Because of the nature of the mixture, the mechanical behaviour of the material depends largely on the stress state. When it is subjected to uniaxial compression, the effect of aggregate interlocking ensures the material offers high resistance to deformation. However, when bituminous concrete is subjected to tension, the interlocking of aggregates can be considerably smaller, and the mixture relies on the cohesive nature of bitumen to resist deformation. Similarly, like any other granular material, the mechanical behaviour of bituminous mixtures can be highly dependent on the confinement pressure. With higher pressure, the friction between aggregates increases, and therefore, the interlocking between aggregates increases. This, in turn, increases the resistance to deformation. \r\n\r\nIn most pavement design methods, bituminous concrete is considered as a linear elastic or a linear viscoelastic material with similar mechanical characteristics in tension and compression. It is typically characterized by a Youngâ€™s modulus and a Poissonâ€™s ratio or by using the corresponding viscoelastic material functions. The difference in mechanical behaviour in tension and compression or the effect of confinement pressure is not given consideration. Understanding the long-term viscoelastic mechanical behaviour of bituminous concrete under compressive and tensile stress modes and under different levels of confinement pressure is crucial as it may have implications in both the fatigue behaviour of bituminous mixtures and rutting. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the stress path is the combined variation of deviatoric and spherical stress that is applied to the material during a test. The mechanical behaviour of granular materials is known to be highly dependent on the stress path. Since granular particles form a significant portion of bituminous mixtures, one can expect its mechanical behaviour to also depend on the stress path. However, only a few studies have investigated the effect of stress path on the mechanical behaviour of bituminous mixtures. It will be useful in finding the permanent deformation with varying horizontal or vertical stress or both of them together. In my doctoral research, I intend to experimentally investigate these aspects of the mechanical behaviour of the material. Such an investigation would help in improving the predictions of stress/strain distribution in pavements. This can, in turn, be helpful in refining the methods of analyzing flexible pavements.\r\n\r\n','R.

The sources for these include both natural and anthropogenic activities. The fate of chemical species released into the Earthâ€™s atmosphere are mostly driven by their reactions with the highly reactive albeit short-lived radical species present in the atmosphere. Of the many such oxidants, hydroxyl radicals (OH) and chlorine (Cl) atoms are mainly responsible for the degradation of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) due to their abundance and reactivity. Degradation of VOCs leads to the generation of secondary pollutants such as ozone, peroxy-alkyl nitrates, and secondary organic aerosols. Kinetic and mechanistic studies of such reactions are necessary to assess the significance of these reactions and their contribution to pollution.\r\nThe photo-oxidation reactions of 1.) tert-butyl chloride, 2.) isobutyl chloride, 3.) vinyl trifluoroacetate and allyl trifluoroacetate and 4.) 2,3-pentanedione with OH radicals and Cl atoms were studied to gain insights into their kinetics and to assess the impact of their emissions to the atmosphere.\r\nThe temperature-dependent kinetics for the reactions with OH radicals were studied using the pulsed laser photolysis laser-induced fluorescence (PLP-LIF) technique while the reactions with Cl atoms were studied using the relative rate (RR) method. In addition to this, the site-specific kinetics of these reactions were investigated using conventional transition-state theory (TST) and canonical variational transition-state theory with small-curvature tunnelling (CVT/SCT).\r\nThe potential influence of these reactions on the atmosphere were also estimated using parameters such as lifetimes, radiative forcing (RF) and global warming potentials (GWPs).\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

However, cost-effective large-scale cellulose-based HMF production is limited due to the poor glucose to HMF conversion, especially in aqueous media. [3] This can be ascribed to the formation of various side products such as levulinic acid, formic acid, humins, etc. Among the side products identified, the polymeric side product, humins, was found to be the major component. Thus, identifying a catalytic system that can reduce the humins formation and thereby enhance the yield of glucose to HMF conversion is of large importance. In this research proposal, I will be discussing the literature on the conversion of glucose to HMF in aqueous and non-aqueous media, their advantages and disadvantages, and crucial factors that determine the yield and selectivity of the reaction. In the next part of the presentation, my research on the polymerization mechanism and kinetics of humins formation during the acid-catalysed glucose to HMF conversion and the strategies identified based on this computational study to mitigate humins formation will be discussed.

Accurate transit demand forecasting and effective policy implementation are crucial to curb personal vehicle growth and promote public transit. Transit demand forecasting models fall into two categories (i) aggregate demand models, and (ii) disaggregate consideration and mode choice models. However, neither one portrays a complete picture of transit demand. Aggregate models overlook individual-level factors, leading to biased estimates, while disaggregate models suffer from sparse survey data and lack of temporal insights. Combining both approaches can provide a richer understanding of traveller decisions and overall transit demand. \r\n\r\nThis study aims to develop a joint behavioural framework to model spatio-temporal aggregate transit demand with disaggregate consideration and multimodal transit choice through four objectives. First, a transit consideration model jointly accounting for market segmentation and spatial heterogeneity is developed using Geographically Weighted Segmented Logistic Regression (GWSLR). Second, a Geographically Weighted Nonlinear Regression (GWNR) is developed to effectively evaluate transit boarding and improve bus ridership. Third, the factors influencing transit alighting behaviour are investigated to enhance prediction accuracy and maximize operational benefits. Fourth, an integrated demand framework is formulated that includes disaggregate consideration and multimodal transit mode choice in the prediction of aggregate demand. \r\n\r\nThe proposed GWSLR demonstrates that neglecting segmentation or spatial heterogeneity can lead to inaccurate predictions and suboptimal policy interventions. The proposed GWNR model provides a more realistic representation of the relationship between transit boarding and its influencing factors, and improves goodness-of-fit by 18.5% in adjusted R-square and 15% in mean absolute error compared to traditional linear regression. The impact of accessibility, information, service quality, and built-environment factors are evaluated on the three dimensions of interest: consideration, multimodal mode choice, and ridership. Notably, real-time operational dynamics and neighbourhood points-of-interest are found to explain 30% and 6.5% of the variance in the alighting model, respectively. Finally, the proposed framework contributes a comprehensive understanding of transit demand to inform decision-makers about which dimensions to improve where, when, and for whom, to achieve sustainable urban mobility. Customized policies derived from the proposed models are illustrated to be more effective in improving transit consideration and ridership than uniform policies derived from traditional models. \r\n','R.

Inverter drives can output variable voltage variable frequency ac power. The quality of output voltage can be enhanced with the use of multilevel inverters. Three-level voltage space vector can be synthesized using two cascaded two-level inverters. Traditionally, the cascaded three-level inverter topology demands two isolated DC power sources for operation. \r\n This talk introduces two carrier-based pulsewidth modulation methods for the cascaded three-level inverter supplied from a single DC power source by thoughtfully balancing the input DC-link capcaitor voltages of the drive system. The first method is a carrier-based pulse width modulation (CBPWM) technique that involves injecting a suitable offset voltage into the sinusoidal modulating signals. This approach is designed to effectively manage neutral-point voltage fluctuations and thus eliminates the necessity for two isolated DC power sources. Deviating from the traditional approach, the second method proposes the carrier-modified PWM approach wherein the carrier signals are adjusted using offset voltages according on the deviations in the DC-link capacitor voltages.  The equivalence between the two PWM methods will also be discussed.\r\n The talk also presents simulation and experimental results to demonstrate their efficacy in driving induction motor load across a wide speed range using a single DC source. The proposed PWM techniques simplify the power supply requirements and enhance load current performance, as evidenced by improved Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) profiles. \r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web conference link',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-04 06:30:21','Active'),(1365,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Cloud-Enabled Digital Twin frame work of an Industrial Robot for Seamless Integration and Task Automation in Autonomous Factories','Mr. Deep Singh (ME19D045)','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering','Guide Name: Prof. N.

To understand this balance, we look into gene regulation, which is at the core of biological function in nature. A set of genes expressing transcription factors that regulate each otherâ€™s expressions form genetic circuits. We develop a computational framework to systematically dissect and characterise how the structures and parameters of genetic circuits govern their responses (circuit function) to a stimulus. The space of network structures and parameters constitutes the design space of genetic circuits. This work extensively studies this design space for all possible three-node genetic circuits by simulating their ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. The simulated time courses are passed through our computational pipeline, which matches similar temporal responses and effectively produces functional clusters. We obtain structural clusters by mapping these functional clusters to the network structures and parameters that produced these functions. Our key findings include, firstly, that the design space is primed to propel the circuits towards stabilisation over time following the application of a stimulus. Secondly, all possible circuit structures support multiple functions contingent upon the parameters. Finally, we define three quantities: structural, parametric and functional diversities. Using these three diversities, we quantify the robustness, evolvability and plasticity in the context of gene regulation at the design space level.\r\n\r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web conference link',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-04 06:30:36','Active'),(1368,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Numerical and Experimental Study on the Hydrodynamic Characteristics of Blended Wing Autonomous Underwater Gliders','Mr. GUGGILLA MUKESH  (OE18D750)','Mr. GUGGILLA MUKESH  (OE18D750), Ph.D scholar','PROF.

It exhibits a G-type antiferromagnetic ordering below 290 K [1]. LCO displays some unique physical properties such as a high melting point, good electric conductivity and good chemical stability in oxidizing and reducing atmospheres at high temperatures, which makes them useful in high-temperature applications such as interconnectors in solid oxide fuel cells [2]. However, most of the studies carried out so far are related to the electrical and thermal properties of LCO. To the best of our knowledge, the optical and magnetic properties of doped LCO have not yet been extensively studied. In Ga-substituted LCO, near-white light emission and near-infrared lasing were reported for 25% and 50% Ga substitution, respectively [3,4]. Doping Ga3+ ion (3d10) at the Cr site also reduces the interaction between the Cr3+ ions, which results in a decrease in antiferromagnetic Neelâ€™s temperature (TN) of LCO [5]. So, it will be interesting to see how different concentrations of Ga and Cr play an important role in the lasing action. Also, it will be interesting to investigate the change in the optical and magnetic properties of LCO upon doping different elements at the La site and the Cr site.\r\n1. Zhou., et al.

CO2 emissions from cement production worldwide as of 2021 is an astounding 2.9 billion tons. Conventional construction methods have failed to satisfy sustainability goals and are incapable of keeping up with the growing demands of the modern world. Therefore, identifying ways to optimise both the building process and the materials used in construction has become essential. Concrete 3D Printing (3DCP) presents new prospects to address this problem. With 3DCP, there is a significant reduction in the cost of formwork and savings in formwork material. Beyond these economic benefits, concrete 3D printing empowers architects and engineers with unprecedented design freedom, enabling the realisation of unconventional and complex geometries that would be prohibitively difficult to achieve with conventional methods.  However, there have only been limited studies on enhancing the mechanical properties of 3D-printed structural elements. Most studies on 3D-printed structural elements are predominantly centred on 3D-printed columns and wall panels, i.e., primarily focusing on compression members. There is limited research on horizontal structural members. In fact, they account for about 43% of the material used in reinforced concrete construction. To advance Concrete 3D Printing technology, it is crucial to direct research efforts towards flexural members as well. Structural optimisation is key to achieving material efficiency, but the complex geometries that are created through this process often pose challenges for traditional construction methods, especially in fabricating formwork. The geometric freedom inherent in Concrete 3D Printing aligns well with structural optimisation, offering a promising avenue for more sustainable and efficient architectural designs. Consequently, this research aims to explore the optimisation of 3D-printable concrete beams to achieve material and reinforcement savings and identify suitable reinforcement strategies, thereby facilitating the broader adoption of this technology.','R.

The aggregates form the structural framework, while the bitumen acts as a binder, coating and holding the aggregates together. The intentional design of voids allows for additional compaction under traffic loads, resulting in volumetric changes over time. A systematic design approach, from the aggregate scale to the mixture scale, is crucial for understanding the evolving nature of bituminous mixtures.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research has four key objectives. The first objective is to develop a rationalized aggregate gradation design using a compressible packing model. The interstices in this gradation will be filled with bituminous mastic. The second objective focuses on characterizing the rheological and tribological properties of such a mastic. Since the mastic facilitates aggregate packing during production and maintains the integrity of the skeleton during service, systematic quantification of its mechanical response and lubricity is essential. The third objective quantifies the workability and compactability of the mixture, assessing how the aggregate gradation and mastic contribute to producing a workable and compactable bituminous mixture. Finally, the fourth objective examines the linear viscoelastic response of the mixture through repeated load haversine compression tests, multiple creep-recovery cycles, and flexural beam bending, comparing the results with bituminous mixtures designed using conventional methods. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation, the overall methodology will be outlined, along with initial results on the design of gap-graded bituminous mixtures. The use of a novel tribological setup featuring a ball-on-three-plates configuration will be explained, and the quantification of interfacial friction using Stribeck curves will be discussed.\r\n\r\n','R.

The thesis takes a microeconomic approach to empirically study the determinants of firm-level bribe demands and their impact on firm performance. We also distinguish between harassment and a collusive type of bribe to study the causes and consequences of corruption. In the first chapter, we study what makes firms vulnerable to facing bribe demands and the amounts paid in bribes at an international level. Using a structure-conduct-performance-governance (SCPG) paradigm, we find firm age, size, profits, and owner and manager gender as the main determinants of firm-level bribe incidence. However, these firms may not be the ones paying more bribes in amount.  In Chapter 2, we use the information gathered from Chapter 1 and train a machine learning model to predict the probability of bribe demand for firms in the manufacturing sector of India. In Chapter 4 we check if corruption moderates the effect of misallocation on firm productivity for firms in the manufacturing sector of India. In Chapter 5 we analyse the impact of corruption on the intensity and efficiency of labour investments for these firms. We find empirical evidence for both the sand and grease hypothesis of corruption. We find a negative direct impact of corruption on firm productivity but a positive indirect impact through misallocation. Similarly, we find the differentiated impacts of corruption on labour investment efficiency based on the performance quantiles of the firms. We thus suggest differentiated policy actions based on firm size, structure and bribe type.

Many earthquake reconnaissance reports have highlighted failures of such buildings due to these coupled irregularities, reinforcing that they strongly influence the seismic response. It is essential to quantify the seismic risk associated with these coupled irregularities in the case of buildings on slopes. While various descriptors exist in the literature to quantify the level of seismic irregularity and vulnerability or risk for buildings with vertical irregularities, not all of them apply to buildings on hill slopes. These existing descriptors typically rely on geometry and fundamental dynamic properties or a combination of both. As a result, statistically verifying the efficacy of existing descriptors in quantifying the seismic risk associated with buildings on hill slopes with coupled structural irregularities is essential. However, current research and building design codes have not adequately addressed the quantification of coupled structural irregularity for buildings on hill slopes, necessitating further investigation.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, RC building typologies prevalently practiced in hilly regions designed to Indian standards, such as split-foundation, step-back, step-back setback, and reference flatland buildings, are considered, and their seismic risk is evaluated through different probability metrics. The probability metrics considered in the present study provide a comprehensive understanding of the relative seismic vulnerability and risk levels of the study buildings on hill slopes. The probability metrics, probabilistic seismic demand models, seismic collapse fragilities, mean annual exceedance probabilities and seismic drift hazard curves indicate that the split-foundation building configuration is more vulnerable to seismic shaking than other typologies. Nonetheless, the probability metric collapse margin ratio of buildings on hill slopes, reveals that they are safe at the current design basis and maximum considered earthquakes specified in the Indian standards. A statistical study further demonstrates a weak correlation between the existing descriptors in the literature and the seismic risk associated with buildings on hill slopes, underscoring the inadequacy of existing descriptors. Therefore, this study proposes a novel seismic irregularity descriptor based on the first three fundamental time periods of buildings on hill slopes, using the Pearson correlation coefficient and its associated p-value as the statistical correlation parameter, showing a strong statistical correlation in quantifying the associated seismic risk.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a geometry-based regularity descriptor is tailored to the unique characteristics of buildings on hill slopes, providing a comprehensive basis for assessing their coupled structural irregularity levels and dynamic behaviour compared to a reference regular flatland building. A new definition of equivalent building height is also introduced, especially for split-foundation building configurations. An empirical formula for estimating the fundamental time period of the split-foundation building frames is formulated and expressed in terms of the proposed regularity descriptor and the equivalent height. The proposed regularity descriptor, equivalent height definition, and an empirical formula were validated through various case studies, and they outperformed existing procedures. Statistical measures, including root mean square error, coefficient of determination, mean square error, and Pearson correlation coefficient, have confirmed the accuracy and predictive capability of the proposed regularity descriptor and empirical formulations.\r\n\r\n','R.

Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond has shown tremendous potential for both spin- and photon-based quantum applications. However, controlling the optical emission from the defect and the ability to couple it to photonic structures is an important challenge for technologies based on NV or other promising quantum defects in diamond. In my Ph.D., I have worked on both theoretical and experimental aspects related to creating photonic structures that eventually will be useful for applications such as single photon emitters, sensitive magnetometers, and the creation of diamond quantum photonic chips. \r\nI will first discuss the metasurface we have designed [1] that can improve the emission from NV centers. Our design relies on exploiting the Mie resonance and Kerker conditions. It enables a more robust structure with highly directional emission, enhanced overall emission, and enhancement of emission in the zero-phonon line of NV by 100s of times. All these properties are crucial for various applications. Then, I will discuss our efforts in understanding the micromachining of photonic structures in diamond using a femtosecond (fs) laser. Light-based structuring can have many advantages, including creation of buried waveguides. While single NV defect creation and some limited structuring work using fs-laser have been demonstrated, greater control of these processes is needed [2]. Towards this, we have conducted non-linear transmission measurements to understand the changes to diamond structure due to fs-laser. I will present these results, which should directly inform the controlled creation of NV centers as well as the creation of photonic structures in diamond. \r\nFinally, time permitting, I will present our work on the design of an efficient and sensitive low-photon flux detector by exploiting Mie and guided-mode resonance. This includes Si-based detector operating at 810 nm and InGaAs based detector operating at 1550 nm, achieving around 90% absorption within ultra-thin (<100 nm) absorbers and reducing dark current by two orders of magnitude compared to conventional designs [3]. \r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n\r\n[1] 	Chowdhury, S., et al., \"Resonant structure for improved directionality and extraction of single photons,\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.04197 (2024).\r\n[2] 	Giakoumaki, A.

The asymptotic limits - â€œsteady-stateâ€ and â€œfast-equilibriumâ€ - implicit in the classical work of Michaelis and Menten and then Briggs and Haldane no longer apply to these experiments [5,6]. This work provides a wide-ranging generalisation of the asymptotic analysis of classical enzyme kinetics to stochastic enzyme kinetics, with the subtle role of molecular fluctuations being clearly delineated. The first part of the work introduces the concept of statistical equilibrium in molecular catalysis by decomposing the stochastic Michaelis-Menten network into reversible and irreversible subnetworks. The reversible and irreversible sub-networks reach detailed balance and stationarity through a relaxation phase, which we characterise by several new statistical measures [7]. The second part examines the effect of molecular fluctuations on enzyme memory and hysteresis in the (non-stationary) transient regime of the mnemonic enzyme network. The transients relax, asymptotically, to a (stationary) non-equilibrium stationary state, where the breakdown of the Kolmogorov loop criterion and chemical detailed balance leads to the emergence of kinetic cooperativity. The third part presents the derivation of exact expressions for spontaneous number correlations and symmetry relations for time reversibility in cyclic enzymatic networks of arbitrary complexity, enabling us to probe their equilibrium or non-equilibrium stationary states.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] H.

We calibrated the TCAD simulator with the measured current-voltage characteristics of un-gated AlGaN / GaN structures where we found that default THERM model in ATLAS is not suitable for simulating Thermionic Emission currents, and that surface recombination velocity-based models should be used instead. From the TCAD simulations, we established the following: (i) Rc increases significantly with NAT and with the depth of the trap level from the conduction band. For trap level 2.5 eV below the conduction band, Rc doubles for an increase in NAT from 1Ã—1016 cm-3 to 5Ã—1017 cm-3. (ii) The variation of Rc with temperature is non-monotonic.

Traditional field-based approaches are time-consuming, prompting the increasing reliance on remote sensing for accurate and quantitative estimates of water quality parameters. Major water quality parameters that can significantly change the spectral reflectance characteristics of surface water are chlorophyll (Chl) (algae), total suspended solids (TSS) (turbidity) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), which serve as a comprehensive indicator of water properties that encompass physical, chemical, and biological characteristics and also the key pollutant-driven products according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These water quality parameters could be used to infer other substances not directly affecting the reflectance properties. Numerous studies have utilised the remote-derived water-quality products and existing water quality index (WQI) models, but they are typically site-specific and yield significant errors for the accurate assessment and monitoring of coastal and inland water bodies. This study presents a generalized WQI model using three major water quality parameters â€“ Chl, TSS and a_CDOM (443) and corresponding indices â€“ Trophic State Index (TSI), Total Suspended Solids Index (TSSI) and CDOM Index (CI), which are derived from new remote-sensing-based models. Finally, WQI products are generated by the Mamdani-based Fuzzy Inference System, and the individual contribution of the water quality parameters to the WQI is analysed for establishing â€˜Water Quality Cellâ€™ (WQ cell), which represents the regions solely dominated by a single parameter. The applicability of the new models is demonstrated using MODIS-Aqua and Sentinel-3 OLCI data from many coastal/estuarine regions dominated by CDOM, sediment-laden river plumes and phytoplankton blooms. In addition, time series analysis is performed along the Indian coast to study seasonal variation of the individual water quality parameters/indices and WQI and spatio-temporal variation of the water quality cells for the period of 2011-2020. The remote-sensing-based water quality assessment methods presented in this study are critical for monitoring and assessing the quality of surface waters that are optically complex in coastal and inland environments and enabling water resources managers to formulate and implement management plans for a variety of water bodies cost-effectively.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web conference link',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-09 06:30:06','Active'),(1387,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\" Comprehensive Mathematical Model of MIDREX Ironmaking Process \"','Mr. Sunil Yadav (MM18D025)','Ph.D scholar, MME Department','Guide: Dr. Ajay Kumar Shukla , MME','Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering','2024/10/15 10:00','2024-10-15','yes','Online (Google Meet)','The MIDREX process is a direct reduction method for producing iron from iron ore pellets or lump ore using natural gas as the reducing agent. This process is significant in ironmaking because it offers a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional blast furnace methods by reducing CO2 emissions and energy consumption.  The MIDREX technology allows to produce of high-purity iron, which is essential for high-quality steelmaking. As the industry seeks to reduce its carbon footprint, processes like MIDREX are becoming increasingly important in the transition to sustainable steel production.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the first part, a thermodynamic model for the MIDREX direct reduction process has been developed and validated with industrial data. The model conceptualizes the process as a counter-current reactor consisting of multiple conceptual reactors. The fraction of gas being utilized in each zone is estimated using the kinetic considerations of the process. The overall kinetic effect involving the effect of mass transfer control in the gas, and solid product, along with chemical reactions at the interface of the unreacted solid surface are considered. The model is used to predict the carbon content, production rate, and metallization for the given set of input variables. The model predictions are in good agreement with industry-reported data. The model thus developed for the MIDREX process can be used as a guiding tool to the process and can be used to study the effect of variation in the operating parameters (like inlet and cooling gas composition, temperature, volumetric flow rates) on the process output parameters (productivity, metallization, and carbon content). The same model can also be used to study the effect of other replacements like coke oven gas, and natural gas in the reduction process with the objective of improvement in the production rate without compromise regarding metallization.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n In the second part, this work presents the development and validation of a static thermochemical model for predicting process parameters in the MIDREX shaft furnace, a method used for producing direct reduced iron from lump ore and pellets. Industrial plant data is used to validate the model. Furthermore, the model is utilized to analyze the process based on different parameters. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to estimate the critical parameters of the process (like reaction factors and extent of reactions) and validate the model with industrial data. Further investigations are conducted to assess the possibility of replacing the reformer gas (bustle gas) with hydrogen and coke oven gas (COG) to make the process greener and almost free from carbon emissions, using a systematic approach of overall heat balance, using already developed coupled thermodynamics and kinetics-based model, and further using those data to estimate the reaction factors and extent of reactions using GA to be used in the static model. The results demonstrate the feasibility of replacing hydrogen and COG without much adverse effect on the process outcomes; however, this results in better metallization and reduced carbon footprint of the process effectively.','MMOFFICE 2','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','Keywords: MIDREX, thermodynamic model, FactSageTM 6.4, mass transfer kinetics, reaction kinetics, Me',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-09 06:30:11','Active'),(1388,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','The 21st Century Lean-Agile Global Supply Chains: The Nexus between Business And Technology','Mr. Allan Rodrigues','Allan Rodrigues pre-maturely retired from the Indian Navy in 1994 after serving over 20\r\nyears.

They\r\nare designed to connect the low labor cost (specialized) manufacturing economies in Greater Asia (China,\r\nS. Korea, and India in the main) with the â€˜knowledge economiesâ€™ where products are conceived and\r\nwhere most high-value target customers are located, mainly in Western Europe and North America.\r\nThe GSC construct is lean (low cost) upstream and Agile downstream with the capacity to ramp up and\r\nfulfill demand â€˜on callâ€™. To achieve this the GSCs link all value activities from the birth to the death (or\r\ndisposal) of a product by mitigating the inherent uncertainty of demand, and by managing the conflict\r\nbetween the low cost at the birth of the product upstream, with the agility to fulfill high demand nearer\r\nthe customer downstream, in innovative ways. Production is managed in networks of super-specialised\r\ndesign, equipment/parts manufacturers using contract manufacturers, delay assembly, and value-added\r\nresellers.\r\nThe construct requires all GSC partners to share critical information and knowledge at their supply-value\r\ninterfaces. Strategic alliances between partners ensure that equitable value is obtained across their value\r\nboundaries. Unfortunately, asymmetries in knowledge sharing often result in a conflict between the\r\nGlobal Supply Chains, and the Strategic Value chains (SVCs), leading to the rise of large â€˜Alpha Malesâ€™ or\r\ngiant entities who exert absolute dominance over their supply-value chains to the detriment of small\r\nbusinesses, smaller nations and often with a deleterious effect on sustainability. Additionally, the\r\nerstwhile low-cost production economies have themselves begun to migrate into creating high-end\r\nproducts and stake a claim for a larger share of value.\r\nThe Pandemic in 2019 followed by the Suez/Panama crisis, and wars in Ukraine/Yemen have had a\r\ncatastrophic effect on the GSCs creating imbalances in container traffic with congestion at the GSC\r\ntransport hubs and ports. Governments and even the UN have sought to rein in the power of the large\r\nglobal entities to make these GSCs more resilient against these events in the first instant, but also to\r\npressurize the GSCs to be more inclusive in ways that benefit not just the global giants but the smaller\r\nentities as well, and to enforce sustainability targets on all GSC partners. The new post-pandemic GSC\r\nconstructs, seek to use high-tech innovation upstream, designed around digital factories based on\r\nIndustry 4.0 concepts and IIOT, AI-enabled predictive analytics, and even blockchains to drive the\r\nlean-agile construct to be low-cost and yet be able to seamlessly ramp up fulfillment where required.\r\nConversely, there is an equal need for the business end to use broad ideation funnels to drive radical\r\ninnovations in strategy and paradigm shifts in positioning, process, and financing to compete and create\r\nwealth.\r\nThere is a need for both ends of the GSC construct, from the proponents of technology on the one hand,\r\nand those who manage the operations-business models on the other, to understand the innards of each\r\notherâ€™s contributions to value. Solutions will need to be crafted at the granular level, at the very birth of\r\neach system, rather than being overlaid on the top. It is vital that educational institutions at both ends of\r\nthis GSC interface extend the reach of their students outside their wheelhouses into areas they are\r\nunfamiliar wit, to gain a holistic view of the business.

Conventional methods, including seawalls and breakwaters, while effective to a degree, are associated with high capital and maintenance costs and are susceptible to catastrophic failure under extreme flow conditions. As an alternative, buffer blocks, modelled after dam stilling basin blocks, present a cost-effective and scalable solution for dissipating wave energy. These blocks induce flow separation, vortices, and hydraulic jumps, thereby reducing flow velocities and mitigating the forces acting on coastal infrastructure. This study systematically investigates the optimal configuration of buffer blocks with a focus on maximizing energy dissipation efficiency. The research addresses both spatial and geometric parameters, evaluating their influence on flow dynamics and energy reduction. Numerical simulations are conducted using a dam-break mechanism to model the flow conditions associated with extreme wave events. Experimental validation is subsequently performed using physical models in a controlled environment to verify and support the numerical results. The primary outcome of this research is the development of an empirical relationship between buffer block geometries, their spatial arrangements, and flow characteristics. This relationship aims to inform the design of coastal defense systems optimized for energy dissipation under extreme wave conditions. The findings contribute to a more resilient coastal protection strategy, offering a technically sound and economically viable solution to mitigate the risks posed by tsunamis and storm surges.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web conference link',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-09 06:30:22','Active'),(1390,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Study of melt flow in the gas-atomization system','Mr. Niraj Kumar (ME18D033)','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM','Guide Name: Prof. Shamit Bakshi, ME /\r\nChairperson: Prof. V.

In this process, molten metal is atomized using high-speed inert gas jet from a gas nozzle, eventually solidifying to form metal powder. The molten metal flows from the crucible into the atomization chamber through a tube called the melt delivery tube (MDT). According to the correlations available, gas-to-metal ratio (GMR) is considered an important parameter in the gas-atomization process for producing metal powders. Consequently, correlations for estimating the mass median particle size (d_50) of powders use GMR as one of the main parameters. GMR includes both gas flowrate and molten metal flowrate. The gas flowrate depends on many geometric and operating parameters. However, it can be easily measured using an in-line flow meter. But, in an industrial setup, it is not easy to measure the transient melt flowrate to ascertain the GMR. This study includes both molten metal flowrate measurement as well as the factors that affect the molten metal flow. In line with the molten metal flowrate measurement, a theoretical approach is developed to estimate the melt flowrate, and the melt flowrate is also measured in a pilot setup. Both the theoretical and computational fluid dynamics approaches are in good agreement with the measurements. A parametric study to elaborate the effect of certain parameters on the melt flowrate is conducted. The theoretical approach presented helps to quickly estimate the instantaneous melt flow rate, and the time of melt flow and also the powder size (d_50) expected from a gas-atomization system. This will help to correctly choose geometric and operating parameters during the gas-atomization process which will help to reduce the spread in powder size distribution in an actual application.

Spin waves, small signal excitations propagating through magnetically saturated films, are promising candidates for developing nonlinear RF devices due to their highly tunable dispersive properties. In the initial stages of our work, we excited surface spin waves in a micrometre-thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. We identified a few hundred MHz wide spin-wave passband. We then built a Spin Wave Active Ring Oscillator (SWARO) using the YIG film as a delay line. The interaction between the external RF drive and oscillator modes was investigated under different oscillator gain settings, drive frequencies, and strengths, leading to the observation of phenomena such as sideband generation, injection pulling, and injection locking in the spectral output of the driven oscillator [1].\r\n\r\nRecent efforts have been directed towards leveraging the nonlinear dynamics of delay-line oscillators to process complex temporal information [2]. Our current focus is on developing a temporal pattern classifier using the SWARO. We modulate the amplitude of a GHz drive with a temporal pattern, inject it into the SWARO, and analyze the output envelope signal to perform the classification task.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

AI/ML models were used to accurately map crop type and crop acreage driven by satellite data, drone data, crowd sourcing and government data. Results indicated that SVM with RBF had high accuracy (~95% as compared to 45% accuracy in records) and was effective in handling complex, nonlinear relationships within agricultural datasets. This led to the use of ARIMA model which effectively could predict the yield of the mapped crops, thereby aiding decision support in crop water releases, crop insurance, and yield storage/transportation facilities.

Further Ordinary Least Squares(OLS), Spatial Lag Model(SLM) and Spatial Error Model(SEM) to assess the strength of correlation between the malnutrition levels and the shortlisted correlates. In stunting women height and iodized salt, in wasting child anemia, in underweight women height and child anemia were found to be significant factors (P<0.01) along with the spatial autoregressive constant. We found that Child age, Caste, Diet diversity, Child underweight status and Female media exposure are important features for Mayurbhanj districts, Child age, Women anemia, education of women, Caste and Household size are an important feature in Dhalai, Child age, education of women, Caste, Women BMI, Diet diversity are important features in Mayurbhanj and for Mumbai, Child age, education of women, Sanitation, Diet diversity and womenâ€™s anemia are important features.  It is envisaged that through these features, a policymaker can intervene and reduce the level of anemia in the area and improve health care practices.Such analysis, in combination with PCA, has shown to be more effective in prioritizing the programme interventions for tackling child malnutrition.\r\n\r\nTo conclude the talk will showcase the importance of Synergized Mappingâ„¢ in aiding data collection to drive AI/ML models for agriculture and health in India.

This study uses a dual-scale porous medium model and computational methods to understand the nature of tuberculosis infection spread within the lungs and its effects on the alveolar oxygen exchange. The entire lung is modelled as a global, equivalent, heterogeneous porous medium comprising three zones with varying permeabilities that correspond to 23 generations of airflow branches. Airflow during each breathing cycle is simulated by solving transient mass and momentum transfer equations across the three zones of the global model. A separate local model is invoked in zone 3, to analyse oxygen exchange between the alveolar airflow and incoming capillary blood via mass transfer equations. The transient mass exchange equations are solved in the local model to yield the percentage of oxygen transferred to the blood. Tuberculosis spread -- and hence, the congestion of the lung -- is introduced by modifying the permeability and porosity of the global porous medium model. The impact of infection on the overall bloodstream oxygen content is evaluated by concurrent use of the global and local models. For the case with a sudden reduction in immunity, severe infection condition is observed at 86% of the total infection spreading time and at 75% for the case with gradual reduction in immunity. For 40% increase in immunity beyond the 50% Î“ stage, it is observed from the simulations that the severe infection situation is completely avoided, preventing any further tuberculosis spread.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web conference linkhttps://meet.google.com/dya-tpxk-rvo',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-10 06:30:16','Active'),(1396,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','Applications of AI in Drug Discovery and Development at Novartis: A Brief Introduction','Dr. Murthy Devarakonda ','Dr. Murthy Devarakonda is a senior AI researcher, Executive Director, and a manager in AI & Computational Science (AICS) unit of Novartisâ€™s Biomedical Research division.

It has been speculated that around one million types of dyes are commercially available, out of which approximately 10,000 types of dyes are used routinely with around 700,000 metric tons/annum consumption worldwide. Dyes are extensively used in many spheres such as textiles, leather, tanneries, paper and printing, food colouring, photography, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, etc. However, the leading consumer of dyes is the textile industry, accounting for 2/3rd of its market. Moreover, 20% of the dyes are left unused during the dyeing process, and discharged as such into the textile effluent. This may release harmful toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic compounds to the receiving water bodies, if the textile effluent is released without proper treatment. Most of the dyeâ€™s compounds are stable in nature, and do not degrade easily. To treat this voluminous effluent generated from textile industries laden with dyes, several biological, chemical, physical treatment technologies have been explored. But considering their limitations such as longer treatment time, secondary sludge generation, high chemical consumption etc, there were demands for other new techniques. Microwave induced catalytic degradation (MICD) technology is one of the novel Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), which can help in treatment and complete mineralization of the dyes. Microwave (MW) irradiation can significantly enhance the dynamics of chemical reactions by utilizing the reactive radicalâ€™s species (mainly hydroxyl, sulfate, superoxide, etc.) for the degradation of dyes over thermally driven conventional heating methods.\r\n\r\nThe entire research work on MICD technology for textile dyes wastewater was divided into two phases. The first phase of this investigation involved preliminary studies, catalyst selection, catalyst characterization, and the treatment of individual dyes under MW application. The key outcomes of the first phase will be briefly discussed in the initial part of the seminar.  Subsequently, the MICD application for the removal of complex mixture of dyes from synthetically prepared samples as well from real textile effluent will be discussed along with the impact of MICD operational parameters on the efficiency of dye wastewater treatment. Overall, the proposed work has a potential to address the sixth Sustainable Development Goal (i.e., SDG-6 - â€œClean water and sanitation) in textile industries. \r\n\r\n','R.

Graphene oxide can host intercalated water interleaved between its sub-nanometer layers, while molybdenum disulfide can host surface water. The effect of water on the electrical, mechanical, and electromechanical properties is presented. The fracture mechanics of graphene oxide films on flexible substrates were used to estimate the influence of intercalated water on its elastic modulus.  A decrease in the in-plane elastic modulus of the film upon water intercalation was attributed to the variation in the nature of the hydrogen bonding network in graphene oxide lamellae [1]. Our findings are essential for understanding the physics of interlayer interactions in layered and functionalized graphene.  They also provide helpful considerations for flexible strain sensors that operate on the generation of parallel crack arrays. Defects in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are among the primary sources of their chemical reactivity, including their response to water. Here, we first demonstrate novel CVD growth of large-area continuous molybdenum disulfide MoS2 films using solution-cast nanoflakes and alkali halides as nucleation sites. The stoichiometric ratio of Mo: S is close to the ideal value of 1: 2, with a very low content of Mo bonded to oxygen. The tunability of these characteristics allowed a comparative study of the interaction of water with these samples. Thickness-dependent studies identify protonic rather than electronic transport as the dominant mechanism in water vapor-exposed MoS2 films. The high-quality continuous films show humidity-insensitive electrical response over a wide interval (5%â€“95% RH), contrasting with the response of isolated MoS2 crystals or partially continuous films. The humidity-insensitive electrical response is attributed to very low edge and basal-plane defect concentrations, leading to low water dissociation and restricted proton transport [2].

At the same time, these devices are notorious for their part in thermo-acoustic instability phenomena.  Bluff bodies in the flow path create unsteady hydrodynamics that directly affect the flame and the heat release. The bluffbody flowfield exhibits hydrodynamic instabilities through the Kelvin-Helmholtz-type curling up in the shear layers and the Bernard-Von-Karman-type vortex street in the wake. Under typical operating conditions of an afterburner, these hydrodynamic instabilities tend to occur at frequencies of a few thousand Hertz, which aligns closely with the range of natural frequencies of transverse acoustic modes of the afterburners. This is a serious threat factor for high-frequency thermo-acoustic oscillations (at a few kHz), also known as screech instability.\r\n\r\nAddressing this potential for screech instabilities requires the knowledge of flame behavior under such oscillations. Motivated by this problem, we investigate the effect of transversally applied harmonic oscillations on the bluffbody stabilized flames.\r\n \r\nThis talk focuses on our numerical investigations into the dynamics of non-premixed bluffbody flame subjected to transverse harmonic excitation at realistic operating conditions of an afterburner. The chosen bluffbody configuration is the Single Flameholder Agumentor (SFA) test rig at the Georgia Institute of Technology. In this work, we adopt the hybrid LES method for our study. This method offers a computationally efficient way to resolve relevant flow scales and switch to RANS-based models in the near-wall regions. To investigate the flame dynamics, we impose harmonic velocities along the transverse direction â€“ mimicking transverse acoustic oscillations â€“ with two forcing amplitudes and five different frequencies. In addition, two forcing schemes, in-phase and out-of-phase, are also considered to account for the phase effect.\r\n\r\nOur results show a clear distinction between the in-phase and the out-of-phase forcing. The cross-flow velocity spectrum displays a distinct character between the in-phase and out-of-phase forcing conditions, with the in-phase forcing condition showing an amplitude-dependent â€œlock-onâ€ behavior of the vortex shedding to the forcing frequency. Further analysis of the flowfield and the time-averaged recirculation zone revealed a drastic reduction in the recirculation length during the lock-on of the in-phase condition and saturation of the recirculation region length for the out-of-phase calculations. \r\n\r\nFurther analysis of unsteady flame dynamics shows that the vortex roll-up into BVK-type wake mode is encouraged in the in-phase forcing with asymmetric sinuous flame structure. Conversely, the out-of-phase forcing discourages the vortex roll-up, resulting in a symmetric flame in the near field wake.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, analysis of the wake flame oscillation amplitudes showed a clear distinction between the two kinds of excitation, and analyzing the phase of these oscillations revealed the creation of vortical disturbances due to the external forcing and the subsequent advection at a near-constant axial velocity throughout the wake. These results underscore the significance of the phase of acoustic oscillations in influencing the wake response. \r\nFinally, we applied the Dynamic Mode Decomposition technique to understand the fuel mixing pattern in the flow field. The DMD amplitude spectrum and the modes indicate that the spray stream also responds to the forcing, contributing to the flame response.

Since reliability and fault tolerance are a major concern in EVs, multi-phase PMSMs have been gaining popularity. While multiphase PMSM offers advantages that suit EV requirements, the speed range remains a concern, as at high speeds, a large back-emf is induced in the winding terminals, and hence, a high input voltage is demanded for the motor operation in these conditions. While Field Weakening (FW) is conventionally used to obtain a larger speed range, the efficiency at high speeds is compromised using this technique. A recent approach is to use winding change-over-based techniques, which provide a wider speed range with greater high-speed efficiency. In this seminar, three such winding change-over techniques will be discussed. These techniques differ from each other in their winding configurations and applications.\r\n\r\nAmong these techniques, a modified tapped winding IPMSM topology is proposed for medium-duty delivery truck applications intended for city traffic. The application of this topology is proven typically reduce the power rating of the power electronic converters by 10%, when compared with FW based techniques. The high-speed efficiency is also improved by 30% for similar applications.\r\n\r\nFurther, a Split-Tapped IPMSM topology is proposed, which is used for vehicles that require a 3-speed mechanical transmission. The objective of this topology is to emulate the effect of a mechanical gear with the help of bidirectional switches so that the overall drive becomes efficient and high-speed operation is obtained. The proposed split-tapped topology also has the ability to reduce the DC bus (battery) voltage rating by up to 26%, when compared with conventional tapped winding IPMSMs.\r\n\r\nFinally, a Dual Three Phase PM assisted Synchronous Reluctance Motor (DTP PMaSynRM) is presented, which can provide 2-speed torque characteristics without any additional switch requirement. A detailed modeling and control technique of this novel topology of the motor will be discussed.\r\n\r\nIn this seminar, the proposed concepts will be discussed, and suitable results will be presented that validate the applicability of these topologies in EV applications.\r\n\r\n ','EEOffice','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web conference linkhttps://meet.google.com/vhs-ffjo-eut',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-11 06:30:12','Active'),(1406,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€œINVESTIGATION OF MANGANESE OXIDE-BASED MATERIALS FOR ENERGY STORAGE APPLICATIONSâ€','Mr. Pernapati Nagaraja','Ph.D. Research scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide - Prof. Ranga Rao G','Department of Chemistry','2024/10/14 15:00','2024-10-14','yes','Online','','O/o Head of the department','cyoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','ALL ARE WELCOME-web conference linkhttps://meet.google.com/sru-oqvf-jnw',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-11 06:30:17','Active'),(1407,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Computational modeling of failure in fluid-structure interaction (FSI)  problems.','Mr. S.P Krishna Phanindra , ED19D750','Ph.D. Scholar, Department of Engineering Design','Dr. K.

Since the earliest days, numerous studies have\r\nbeen conducted to understand the flow characteristics around the spur dikes by varying their\r\nspacing, length, shape, permeability, and submergence. Despite several studies, knowledge of\r\nflow characteristics around the spur dikes is still poorly understood, resulting in damages and\r\nfailures worldwide. Furthermore, such failures are aggravated under extreme conditions like\r\nfloods, land-slide-induced surges, and tidal bores. Understanding the complexities and unique\r\nflow characteristics of river dikes is essential to protect these structures adequately. Thus, this\r\nstudy aims to investigate experimentally and numerically the interaction of tidal bore-like\r\nunsteady flow with the river spur dikes. The proposed experimental work is conducted at the\r\nInstitute of Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Management (IWW), RWTH Aachen\r\nUniversity laboratory, which offers a unique bore generation facility for generating extreme\r\nflow scenarios to replicate tsunami and tidal bores. Numerical simulations are carried out with\r\nthe Open source CFD solver OpenFOAM to generate the tidal bore-like flow using the\r\nâ€œinterFoamâ€ solver. During the flow interaction with the spur dike, the tidal bore induces a\r\nshort-duration impulsive pressure followed by overflow. This causes a significant difference\r\n(in the quasi-steady phase) observed between upstream and downstream of the spur dike,\r\nresulting in scour at downstream due to flow overtopping and vortex formations.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web conference link',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-14 06:30:12','Active'),(1409,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Mixed Traffic Characterization, Estimation and Prediction','Ms. Abirami Krishna A, Roll No. CE18D012','Ph.D Research Scholar','Dr. Bhargava Rama Chilukuri  - Guide, Dr. Karthik K Srinivasan - DC Member, Dr. Lelitha Devi V - DC Member, Dr. Rajendran C (MS) - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head','Civil Engineering','2024/10/15 14:30','2024-10-15','yes','BSB 104, Conference Room','In mixed traffic conditions, variations in static and kinematic characteristics of vehicles and the resulting asymmetric interactions that arise, the traditional state variables (speed, flow, density, queue length, etc.) that represent the aggregate behaviour are inadequate to represent class-wise behaviours. Therefore, the first part of the study proposes a novel framework for characterising mixed traffic conditions based on vehicle class-wise speeds based on empirical data. From the unsupervised clustering methods, 50 class-agnostic traffic states are defined for the scenario of 5 distinct vehicle classes covering vehicular speeds up to 65 kmph . Also, an area occupancy-based approach is proposed to estimate class-wise speeds from class-agnostic disaggregated travel-time data. The ordering of traffic states and class-based characterisation are fine-tuned based on empirical data. The study analyses the possible against observed patterns of class-wise speeds across 12-speed bins for varying number of distinct vehicle classes in the traffic stream to investigate the influence of vehicle composition. In the second part of the study, parametric  and non-parametric prediction models are also developed for state and class-wise speed predictions. The results demonstrate that the joint prediction approach (simultaneous prediction of multiple classes using the proposed state characterisation definitions) is computationally efficient and more accurate for practical applications than the marginal predictions using class-wise speed predictions. Moreover, the order of the class-wise speeds is more robustly preserved in the former than in the latter. The results show that the marginal prediction preserved the speed order in only 46 % of the observations, but that improved to 58 % with the proposed joint prediction. The last part of the study explores the state estimation for the connected vehicle scenario. Towards this, the study proposes multiple methods for estimating local traffic state using trajectory data from instrumented vehicles with varying levels of surrounding awareness under homogeneous traffic conditions. The proposed methodologies are validated using empirical data demonstrating that the mean values of traffic flow and density estimates obtained using the proposed method for multiple discrete sections and time periods align closely with the ground truth values (MAPE values are 8.6% and 8.8%, respectively for flow and density estimates). The interquartile ranges are also relatively narrow, indicating low variability and high precision in the estimates. The methods proposed in this work are simple, easily scalable and adaptable to various traffic conditions for more efficient traffic management strategies.\r\n','R.

Energy from these eco-friendly sources necessitates an energy storage system to ensure a consistent and reliable power supply for consumers. One such system is the redox flow battery. This electrochemical device can be scaled independently in terms of both energy storage capacity and output power to suit multi-scale applications. Chemistry based on vanadium redox species has an edge over others with respect to mitigating the cross-contamination of electrolytes. The standard industrial vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) stack is made of thick graphite bipolar plates to support the flow field required for optimal circulation of electrolyte. These thick plates suffer from electrolyte seepage, poor mechanical properties, and high machining and processing costs. Other bipolar plates made from polymer-based composites face challenges related to electrical conductivity and interfacial contact resistance. In the present work, we propose the use of metallic bipolar plates for the construction of the VRFB cell. Through comprehensive electrochemical investigations, we intend to show that Hastelloy C276, a corrosion-resistant high Nickel alloy, is a suitable bipolar plate material in VRFB cells. We further aim to demonstrate that surface texture modification, in the form of a mix of concave and convex spherical indentations on the metallic bipolar plate, enhances stack and overall system performance, electrochemically, hydrodynamically and mechanically.â€','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web conference link',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-14 06:30:27','Active'),(1412,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Materializing Ethics: Affective Being and the Transformative Potentials of Slow Art in the Fiction of J.

Drawing on food theory, affect theory, new materialisms, neurobiology, and modernist aesthetics, it explores how Coetzee\'s novels communicate embodied experiences and highlight our affective existences within material networks. The research investigates alimentary practices in shaping colonial power discourses, proposing ethical food relationships as pathways to new modes of being. It analyzes waste as a means to challenge socio-economic values and artistic norms, and explores slowness as an experiential category central to engaging with Coetzee\'s texts. The thesis dismantles affect-reason dichotomies, emphasizing the affective nature of reasoning and decision-making. It examines Coetzee\'s focus on older persons\' capacity for self-transformation, rejecting totalizing notions of self in favor of episodic (re)orientations. The study concludes by discussing late-modernist and off-modernist aesthetics in Coetzee\'s works, exploring how otherness engenders processes of slow negotiation that are opposite to instrumentalizing technological logic. It posits that Coetzee\'s novels, through cognitive and physical disorientation, invite sustained engagement with problems rather than swift solutions, underlining the evental potential of art.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords: affect, food, plasticity, slowness, waste\r\n\r\n','HSS OFFICE','hsoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web conference linkhttps://meet.google.com/gex-xbob-xnz',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-15 06:30:06','Active'),(1413,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','Moments of Character Polynomials and the Restriction Problem','Dr. Digjoy Paul','Digjoy is a CV Raman postdoctoral fellow at the Indian Institute of Science,  Bangalore.

Nuclear power offers a valuable opportunity to meet the significant energy demand required for this process, alongside generating electrical power. The primary focus of this study is modelling an efficient and cost-effective nuclear-based power and hydrogen cogeneration system and optimizing it to improve performance. It proposes a power plant cycle aided by a nuclear reactor providing 300 MW thermal power input. Supercritical CO2 is the main working fluid used in the Brayton cycle. It is essentially a Recompression Brayton cycle having a main compression intercooling feature. The Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is also employed, which is a secondary cycle for useful utilization of heat that will be wasted otherwise. A Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzer (PEME), which utilizes electricity generated by the ORC, facilitates the production of Hydrogen by splitting water via electrolysis. Additional attention is given to ORC fluid selection by employing and comparing the performance of widely acknowledged R245fa together with its more ecofriendly replacements, R1233Zd(E) and R1234Ze(Z). The evaluation of the system performance is conducted through the lenses of Energy, Exergy, and Economics. Essential parameters are scrutinized to gauge their impact on two pivotal objectives. Overall Exergy Efficiency takes care of the thermodynamic performance and the economic aspect is scrutinized by Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOEn). Notably, by employing R245fa as the ORC working fluid, the system attains peak Energy efficiency of 42.13% and Exergy efficiency of 58.32%, and a minimum LCOEn of 0.063 USD/kWh. Furthermore, a multiobjective optimization exercise is executed to fine-tune the systemâ€™s operational parameters, to obtain the finest possible operating condition of the system. This optimization results in a 3.12% increase in Overall Exergy Efficiency and a 9.79% decrease in LCOEn compared to the base operating condition when R245fa is used as the ORC fluid. The Overall Exergy Efficiency & LCOEn in best possible operating condition are 58.25% & 0.0645 USD/kWh using R245fa as ORC fluid, 58.23% & 0.0645 USD/kWh using R1233Zd(E) as ORC fluid and 58.22% & 0.0644 USD/kWh using R1234Ze(Z) as ORC fluid.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web conference linkhttps://meet.google.com/yhk-dpfe-gte ',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-15 06:30:16','Active'),(1415,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL',' â€œThe Eisenstein ideal of weight $k$ and ranks of Hecke algebrasâ€  ','Dr. Shaunak Deo,  ','.',' Assistant Professor,  Department of Mathematics,  Indian Institute of Science (IISc- Bangalore).','Department of Mathematics','2024/10/17 15:00','2024-10-17','yes','Seminar Hall (KCB 522), 5th Floor','Let $p$ and $\\ell$ be primes such that $p > 3$ and $p \\mid \\ell-1$ and $k$ be an even integer.

Energy from these eco-friendly sources necessitates an energy storage system to ensure a consistent and reliable power supply for consumers. One such system is the redox flow battery. This electrochemical device can be scaled independently in terms of both energy storage capacity and output power to suit multi-scale applications. Chemistry based on vanadium redox species has an edge over others with respect to mitigating the cross-contamination of electrolytes. The standard industrial vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) stack is made of thick graphite bipolar plates to support the flow field required for optimal circulation of electrolyte. These thick plates suffer from electrolyte seepage, poor mechanical properties, and high machining and processing costs. Other bipolar plates made from polymer-based composites face challenges related to electrical conductivity and interfacial contact resistance. In the present work, we propose the use of metallic bipolar plates for the construction of the VRFB cell. Through comprehensive electrochemical investigations, we intend to show that Hastelloy C276, a corrosion-resistant high Nickel alloy, is a suitable bipolar plate material in VRFB cells. We further aim to demonstrate that surface texture modification, in the form of a mix of concave and convex spherical indentations on the metallic bipolar plate, enhances stack and overall system performance, electrochemically, hydrodynamically and mechanically.â€','NATTAR MUTHU M, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web conference link',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-15 06:30:32','Active'),(1418,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Enhanced Understanding of Extreme Weather Events in the Bay of Bengal and their Impact on Nearshore Coastal Processes','MR.

These events cause significant damage, and improved knowledge enables better forecasts, disaster preparedness, and resilient coastal defenses. It also helps mitigate socio-economic and environmental impacts by supporting sustainable management strategies and ecosystem conservation.\r\nThis study examines nearshore coastal processes like storm surges using a statistical and numerical modeling approach. Other processes, including storm-induced waves, coastal inundation, and nearshore morphodynamic bed changes, are investigated using a coupled hydrodynamic-wave-morphodynamic modeling framework. The main motivation of this thesis is to enhance predictive capabilities (both statistical and numerical modeling approaches) with a simplified methodology by thoroughly understanding cyclones and their impact on nearshore coastal processes.  For the statistical modeling aspect, this study proposed a novel a novel tropical cyclone surge potential index (TCSPI) for estimating TC-induced potential peak surge levels near the landfall locations for the entire coast of the BoB. The proposed TCSPI incorporates atmospheric and bathymetry parameters that are often readily available in real-time for BoB. The inclusion of approach angle and associated coastal geometry information led to improvements of the TCSPI to other existing surge indices. Further, this study utilized renowned regression-based supervised machine learning (ML) models on small data samples to rapidly predict peak surge height across an extensive coastal region of BoB, Using the same atmospheric and bathymetry parameter information that have been considered in the TCSPI at the landfall time frame. Finally, the observed peak surge values associated with historical TC events in the BoB are compared with those estimated by TCSPI, ADCIRC, and ML models. The errors associated with TCSPI are comparatively less. The consideration of approach angle information in the TCSPI has improved the accuracy of the overall prediction of peak surge height associated with historical TCs by up to 17% and 19% for observed and ADCIRC-simulated peak surges, respectively. \r\n	Further, as an application of the TCSPI model, this study created a surge hazard map for the eastern coast of India using the TCSPI model for the effective long-term planning for coastal districts necessitates accurate estimates of peak surge heights associated with cyclones. Traditional methods for developing surge hazard maps rely on complex, fully physics-based numerical models that require generating synthetic cyclone tracks, making the process intricate and time-consuming. Using historical data from the IMD (1982â€“2022), return periods were determined based on cyclone wind speeds at landfall for each Indian coastal state. Additionally, climate change projections from the IPCC were considered. A simple and computationally efficient methodology was developed to estimate peak surge heights, which was then used to create surge hazard maps. Peak surge heights for various return periods were estimated along the coastal districts of the Indian east coast, it is observed to be about 10 m maximum peak surge height along the northern BoB. For a 100-year return period, 19 out of 30 coastal districts showed high vulnerability to storm surges, with peak surge heights increasing by 10% to 18% due to climate change.\r\n	For the numerical modeling approach, this study employed hydrodynamic models (ADCIRC and TELEMAC-2D), wave models (SWAN and TOMAWAC), and the morphodynamic model (GAIA) to investigate the nearshore impacts on water levels, wind waves, inundation, and morphodynamic bed evolution caused by the storms in the BoB. Studying bottom friction and wind drag in northern BoB is crucial as they significantly affect surge height, inland reach, and forecast accuracy. To explore these effects, this study proposes a methodology to examine the impact of combining different bottom friction (i.e., linear, quadratic and hybrid) and wind drag (i.e., Garrat, Wu, Zijlema, and Powell) coefficient formulations on storm surges by systematically adjusting their coefficients. Overall analysis of results shows that lower bottom friction and a higher wind drag coefficient cause an increase in storm surge water levels. The linear bottom friction formulation performs poorly, whereas the nonlinear hybrid bottom friction performs better, followed by the quadratic bottom friction coefficient Wu\'s wind drag formulation overpredicts surge value, whereas the rest of the wind drag formulations underpredict.\r\n	Further, it is noted that cyclonic wind is the primary forcing for predicting the surge and inundation, better representation of TC wind fields is vital. Therefore, this study focused on improving the cyclonic wind field hindcast for the BoB. The literature indicates that the blended wind field approach is an advanced method that superimposes a parametric wind model with a background wind model. This study proposed an enhanced blended wind field approach in which this study assesses the five parametric wind models [Jelesnianski, Rankine vortex, Willoughby, Holland, and Generalized Asymmetric Holland (GAHM)]. Two global wind models [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis and Weather Research Forecast (WRF)] using coupled ADCIRC+SWAN model. Based on the accuracy assessments results this study incorporated a blending approach to superimpose parametric and global wind models smoothly. Further this study performed sensitivity analysis on storm surges, wind waves and coastal inundation due to different cyclone wind models. The results reveal that a blended wind model based on GAHM and WRF can better simulate the background wind field and the internal structure of the cyclone for the BoB region.\r\n	Further, it is noted that studying nearshore morphological bed evolution due to cyclones is important as it impacts coastal stability, sediment transport, and erosion. This understanding aids in effective coastal management and disaster mitigation. Therefore, this study introduces a coupled hydrodynamic (TELEMAC-2D) -wave (TOMAWAC) -morphodynamic (GAIA) model to investigate morphodynamic changes during storm surges. This study introduced a modified parametric wind model to enhance wind field representation near and far from the cyclone center. The simulated storm surges and wind waves were validated against in-situ observations for TC Hudhud (2014) and TC Varadah (2016), and the simulated morphodynamic bed evolution was validated with field-measured data collected for TC Nivar (2020). Further, this study evaluates the performance of different bed load transport formulations for predicting morphodynamic bed evolution during TC Nivar (2020) under storm-induced currents and waves. Results indicate that the Engelund-Hansen model is most effective for currents alone, while the Bijker model excels for combined currents and waves along the open coast of BoB. The results also indicate that the incorporation of the effect of waves along with currents has enhanced the predictive capability of the coupled model framework.\r\n','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web conference link',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-15 06:30:37','Active'),(1419,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Investigation of Floating offshore wind turbine integrated with solid ballast tank','Mr.Rushikesh Dipak Kamble (OE21D030)','Mr.Rushikesh Dipak Kamble (OE21D030) - Ph.D Scholar','Dr.Vijay K G - Guide','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','2024/10/16 16:30','2024-10-16','','Conference hall, Department of Ocean Engineering','In recent decades, research and industrial development in offshore energy have highlighted floating offshore wind turbines as a promising and sustainable solution for harnessing offshore wind energy. To move forward in this direction, there is a need for innovative approaches in symbiosis with conventional knowledge for designing floating platforms and testing methodology. The development of the large displacement platform to support the floating wind turbine is hugely CAPEX-consuming and will prevent investors from entering the market. An innovative solution like the Tetraspar platform with the suspended keel is a perfect example of a small displacement and cost-effective platform fabricated from production-ready components from pre-existing supply chains and production lines. The primary need of any floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) platform is to maintain structural integrity and unhindered energy production despite coupled loading; that can be achieved by avoiding the resonance region and improving the platform\'s stability. The solid ballast tank (SBT) integrated floating offshore wind turbine platform will promise to perform both. The improvement in the added mass will trigger the shift of the natural frequencies, whereas the stability will be enhanced with the improvement in metacentric height. Also, integrated SBT designs will help reduce the size of the floating platforms. Despite its simplicity, the applications of SBTs in FOWT have not been explored extensively, and hence, the proposed study will focus on the coupled analysis of FOWT with SBTs. The proposed study aims to experimentally quantify the FOWT with SBT in terms of SBTâ€™s weight and installation position. The better case is further investigated for metocean data harness, particularly for the Indian offshore Scenario.

Due to this interesting property, BiFeO3 has a great advantage in the field of photovoltaic application. But the main bottle neck is the low short circuit current (Jsc), which restrict the application of BiFeO3 in the field of solar cell.

Converting CO2 to methane is one of the means to store renewable energy as it is a hydrogen carrier and a feedstock for other value-added chemicals.[1] Experimental literature showed nickel supported on ceria in the nano-rod morphology with (110) as the primary facet to be a highly active support for Ni for the CO2 methanation reaction.[2] However reaction mechanism and the role of the different components in the catalyst in determining the reaction pathways and energetics is still not clear. This investigation is aimed at addressing this aspect using detailed Density Functional Theory simulations. An Ni4/CeO2(110) catalyst model which has active site features representative of the actual catalyst was used for the simulations. A thermodynamically stable partially reduced (16.7% oxygen vacancy concentration) and hydroxylated (0.8 ML hydrogen coverage) ceria catalyst surface was identified using ab-initio thermodynamics approach to be representative of the ceria support during typical methanation reaction (230-250Â°C, P = 1 atm). CO2 methanation can proceed in three pathways: 1) via CO2 hydrogenation to form HCOO, 2) via CO2 hydrogenation to form COOH, and 3) via CO2 dissociation to CO + O and subsequent hydrogenation of CO. [3] Our mechanistic investigation showed the formate pathway initiated both on the metallic nickel sites and at the Ni-CeO2 interface to be be more favourable compared to the carboxyl pathway which had very high activation barrier for COOH formation from CO2 (1.96 eV). The CO2 dissociation pathway is favourable and not desirable as it is likely to result in CO formation. Based on the agreement of the computational IR features of the key reaction intermediates and those of relevant adsorbed species from in-situ DRIFTS experiments in literature [4], It was inferred that the reaction is more feasible to start at interface then followed by HCO formation on the nickel surface, it then proceeds again on the interface forming H2CO & H3CO.

In more detail, the encryptor encodes an attribute x together with a bound t on the machine running time and a message m into the ciphertext, the key generator embeds a Turing machine M into the secret key and decryption returns m if and only if M(x) = 1. Crucially, the input x and machine M can be of unbounded size, the time bound t can be chosen dynamically for each input and decryption runs in input specific time.\r\n\r\nPreviously the best known ABE for uniform computation supported only non-deterministic log space Turing machines (NL) from pairings (Lin and Luo, Eurocrypt 2020).

We construct the first ABE for NL from the LWE, evasive LWE (Wee, Eurocrypt 2022 and Tsabary, Crypto 2022) and Tensor LWE (Wee, Eurocrypt 2022) assumptions. This yields the first (conjectured) post-quantum ABE for NL.\r\n2. Relying on LWE, evasive LWE and a new assumption called circular tensor LWE, we construct ABE for all Turing machines.

This rigidity, comes from their solid connection to the foundation, results in a slightly shorter natural time period than their floating structures. Including a framework of interconnected tubular members with rigid connections, jacket structures offer strength and stability in the challenging offshore environment. However, the working performance of these jacket structures is significantly influenced by dynamic forces coming from the random ocean environment. The interaction between the random ocean dynamics and offshore  jacket structures can lead to joint rotations and deformations, introducing nonlinearity into the system. The degree of joint nonlinearity is a critical factor that can affect these offshore structures\' dynamic responses. This comprehensive study extends its focus to involve complete 2D jacket structures by using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software to model joint behaviour and understand the nonlinear dynamic behaviour. The joint modeling approach not only considers the influence of varying angles between members but also accounts for joint buckling under varying external loading conditions. In the presence of joint buckling, the nonlinear behaviour of the jacket structure changes significantly. This becomes more significant because it may cause significant fatigue damage to the structural joints. The study is focused on understanding the joint buckling and its nature under random ocean waves for a 2D jacket structure. Further, the effect of buckling on the nature of response is studied.

Customers and stakeholders are concerned about food safety and prompt delivery. Hence, there is a need for a visible food supply chain (FSC), which can be accomplished through innovative technologies. However, these technologies are expensive and take a long time to implement. Hence, operational efficiency, which constitutes cost and time, has also become a priority for the parties involved in the FSC. However, in the current FSC scenario, there is a limited option for tracking the provenance of a food product. Cutting-edge technologies can make this possible because it is challenging to create a visible supply chain manually. Blockchain is such a technology that helps in visibility.\r\nThis study employs a multi-faceted approach. Firstly, a mathematical model is developed to assess blockchainâ€™s impact on FSC visibility and operational efficiency. This compares the conventional supply chain with the blockchain-based supply chain and identifies the conditions favouring blockchain profitability and determines the optimal number of transactions. Secondly, a framework is proposed for an Australian milk supply chain where blockchain is integrated with the Internet of Things and cloud to enhance visibility with reduced cost in an Australian milk supply chain. Design science research methodology is used for this. A cost and visibility analysis are performed, which demonstrates blockchainâ€™s long-term profit enhancement and its positive correlation with visibility. Thirdly, a case study is performed on a dairy supply chain (DSC) in Gippsland, Australia. Vehicle routing optimization in a conventional DSC is compared with that of a blockchain-based DSC.\r\nThe findings indicate that implementing blockchain will be profitable when the transaction cost in conventional cases is high and the cost of adding transactions to blockchain is less. Another finding is that implementing blockchain will yield a substantial return on investment. It has also been found that integrating IoT and cloud with blockchain is a more advantageous and profitable approach than solely implementing blockchain alone. Apart from this, when blockchain and its allied technologies are used for vehicle routing optimisation for an FSC, the operational cost of the vehicles can be reduced significantly.\r\nThe proposed work motivates the supply chain entities to implement blockchain in their supply chain, resulting in improved trust and coordination among entities and consumers. The blockchain implementation leads to a greater competitive advantage in the field of FSC. Customers will also be willing to spend a higher price for the products due to additional benefits.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web conference link',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-17 06:30:38','Active'),(1431,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Social Life of Caste and the Question of Social Mobility','Ms. Thampatty Madhusood','PhD Research Scholar, HS20D017','Prof. Binitha V.

Contrary to this expectation, modern capitalist societies are characterized by deepening inequalities and a reinforcement of cultural identities. This dynamic has been particularly scrutinized in India, where the intersection of modernity and the entrenched caste system presents complex challenges to social mobility.\r\nIn Kerala, the Ezhavasâ€”a community classified as Other Backward Class (OBC)â€”have made significant strides in overcoming their historical forms of marginalization and securing social mobility. They have emerged as key players and beneficiaries in Keralaâ€™s democratic transformation. This progress is frequently attributed to the Kerala model, known for its state-led initiatives aimed at dismantling social hierarchies. Nevertheless, debates around the experiences of other lower caste groups have prompted a deeper examination of the Ezhavasâ€™ ascent. Factors contributing to their success include their sizable population, the social momentum gained through early anti-caste movements, and political mobilization that has enabled them to engage fully in the democratic process and seize modern opportunities. Feminist and anti-caste scholarship continues to explore how this elevation in status influences the regionâ€™s socio-political relations.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, this doctoral research takes shape around three axioms of inquiry i) exploring the material and ideological transformations within the Ezhava community over time, ii) investigating the evolution of gender ideologies within the community, and iii) tracing the evolution of religiosity among its members. Qualitative interviews were conducted with women from the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP), the caste organization of the community, across the southern districts of Kerala. From this fieldwork, three themes emerged that attempted to capture the material and ideological transformations of the community: the processes and effects of social mobility in Ezhavas, its effects on the contemporary socio-political landscape of the region, and the resulting caste ideologies. This empirical data, in conjunction with existing research on caste dynamics and social mobility, the political discourse surrounding community politics, and insights from critical case studies on caste dynamics, forms a comprehensive thesis chapter that addresses vital questions of social mobility in Kerala.  \r\n\r\n','HSS OFFICE','hsoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web conference linkmeet.google.com/ckn-griu-hgq',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-18 06:30:06','Active'),(1432,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Electrical and magnetic property studies on RCo0.5Ni0.5O3-Î´ (R = La, Pr) thin films','Mr. SREEJITH P K, (PH15D036)','PhD Scholar','Guide(s): Dr. SANKARANARAYANAN V & Dr. RAMACHANDRA RAO M S','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/10/21 16:30','2024-10-21','yes','HSB-209, Seminal Hall, Department of Physics ','The realization of novel functionalities by tuning magnetic interactions in rare-earth perovskite thin films opens up exciting research and technological prospects. Strain tuning of magnetic interactions in rare-earth cobaltates and nickelates is of central importance due to their unique electronic transport properties. In rare-earth cobaltates such as LaCoO3, Co3+ can exhibit temperature-dependent spin state transitions due to multiple spin degrees of freedom, namely low spin (LS) state, intermediate spin (IS) state and high spin (HS) state. Rare-earth nickelates, on the other hand, are known to exhibit metal-insulator transitions associated with complex antiferromagnetic ground states owing to the charge disproportionation among the adjacent Ni ions in the octahedral environment [1]. The present thesis reports on the role of Co spin-state transitions in tuning the magnetic interactions between Co, Ni and rare-earth ions in RCo0.5Ni0.5O3âˆ’Î´ (R = La, Pr) thin films and realizing novel functionalities in these disordered rare-earth perovskites. In LaCo0.5Ni0.5O3âˆ’Î´ thin films, we have investigated the temperature-dependent switching of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) around the ferromagnetic ordering temperature of 50 K. Below 50 K, we see a subtle change in the magnetization dynamics, which breaks the long-range order, introducing glassiness in the system [1]. Further, in PrCo0.5Ni0.5O3âˆ’Î´ thin films, we explored the 3d - 4f antiferromagnetic exchange interaction and low-temperature spin re-orientation using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Pr M4,5 and Co / Ni L2,3 absorption edges under tensile and compressive strain environments [2]. Comparative studies of RCo0.5Ni0.5O3âˆ’Î´ (R = La, Pr) thin films on various substrates show the influence of biaxial strain in tuning the magnetotransport properties in the system [1], [2].\r\nReference:\r\n1.

Urea-containing wastewater has significant risks to both the environment and human health. Urea is naturally converted to ammonia, which is further oxidized to nitrates, nitrites and nitric acid. These substances accumulate in the water bodies and pose a potential threat to human health and aquatic life [2]. Numerous studies are focused on advancing the UOR as an effective method for wastewater treatment and energy conversion. The available urea-rich wastewater has also been identified as a good source of H2 production, offering a sustainable energy solution [3]. Moreover, the standard redox potential for urea electrolysis is 0.37 V (vs. RHE), which is significantly lower than that of conventional water electrolysis (1.23 V vs. RHE) which is 70% less than that required for water electrolysis [4]. However, the implementation of UOR from laboratory to industry is largely limited by the sluggish reaction kinetics due to 6e- transfer process. Therefore, design and synthesis of highly stable and efficient electrocatalyst materials are needed to drive the UOR kinetics, which can simultaneously suppress competitive OER and promote electron transfer [5]. Recently, nickel and nickel-based nonprecious transition-metal anode catalysts have been examined as efficient UOR catalysts in alkaline media. Several Ni-based catalysts, including Ni(OH)2, NiO, Ni3N, Ni2Mo/graphene, Ni-WC/C, NiFe-LDH, Ni3Cr2/C, are demonstrated to be successful in enhancing current density for UOR while significantly reducing material costs. The talk will be mainly focussed on the different class of nickel-based materials and to understand the catalytic activity of materials for UOR. We investigated the UOR of bimetallic nickel molybdenum carbide (Ni@Mo2C) synthesized using high energy ball-milling method. The synergistic electronic effect between Ni and Mo2C components efficiently transfer electrons from Ni to Mo2C, generates active sites thereby facilitating the catalytic activity of urea oxidation reaction [6].\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] W.

One promising approach to achieve these properties is through ultra-fine-grained (UFG) materials, where the reduced grain size aids in hindering the dislocation movement, thereby increasing the strength. Recently, carbide-free nano-bainitic steels have gained popularity due to their cost-effective production and ability to achieve UFG microstructures through heat treatments, avoiding expensive high-energy processes. This current research explores the microstructural evolution and transformation behavior of bainitic steel under various thermomechanical conditions, focusing on mechanical properties and hydrogen permeation resistance. The study investigates how minor cold and cryo-rolling influence the Transformation-Induced Plasticity (TRIP) effect and variant pairing, optimizing mechanical performance through controlled deformation. In-situ heating in TEM enables detailed observations of low-temperature, non-equilibrium austenite reversion, offering key insights into phase stability and atomic-level transformation mechanisms. The study also delves into the kinetics and mechanisms of bainite transformation, seeking to deepen the understanding of phase evolution, growth processes, and their influence on the material\'s microstructure. Additionally, hydrogen permeation behavior in bainitic steel is examined to assess susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement, with a focus on the role of microstructural features in hydrogen diffusion. Overall, these investigations contribute to the development of high-performance nano-bainitic steel for demanding applications.','MMOFFICE 2','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','Keywords: Nano-bainitic steel, Transformation-Induced Plasticity, Austenite reversion, Hydrogen perm',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-18 06:30:21','Active'),(1435,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','â€œSyntheses and characterization of low-dimensional quaternary metal sulphides of germanium and tinâ€','Mr. Sujeeth Kumar D (CY18D002)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide- Prof. K Vidyasagar, \r\nCo-Guide- Prof. Rajakumar B, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/10/23 16:00','2024-10-23','yes','CB-310, Chemistry Seminar Hall','The quaternary metal sulfides exhibit remarkable compositional diversity and structural complexity, making them attractive candidates for a wide range of applications, including ion-exchange, ionic conductivity, thermoelectricity, and photocatalysis [1-4].

Poor EMI performance can result in unintended interference with other equipment in the network or with sensitive subsystems, such as control circuits, affecting the normal operation of the converter and potentially causing damage. To ensure the satisfactory and reliable operation of any converter in an electromagnetically active environment, it must comply with EMI requirements directed by international standards.\r\n\r\nThis work focuses on identifying the dominant sources of conducted EMI and conduction paths, high-frequency modelling of filter inductors, and estimating the parasitic capacitance offered by thermal interface material (TIM) in a three-phase grid-connected inverter system. The literature reports that the primary source of EMI is the high-speed switching of power semiconductor devices, such as IGBTs and MOSFETs, which generate trapezoidal voltage and current waveforms with steep transients. In addition, high-frequency ringing resulting from L and C parasitic elements within the circuits significantly contributes to EMI. This work highlights the use of Fourier-based spectral analysis to characterize EMI sources and their dominant spectral components, emphasizing the influence of key parameters such as DC bus voltage, rise and fall times of power devices, switching frequency and PWM technique on emissions.\r\n\r\nConducted EMI, ranging from 150 kHz to 30 MHz, is classified into common mode (CM) and differential mode (DM) noise. Extensive literature has acknowledged that CM currents leak through the parasitic capacitance provided by the TIM mounted between the device tab and the heatsink. Accurate prediction of these currents depends on the precise value of the parasitic capacitance. However, theoretical estimates of capacitance tend to be inaccurate under varying temperature and frequency conditions. This work introduces an experimental method to estimate the parasitic capacitance of the TIM under realistic operating conditions using a double pulse test (DPT) circuit. Apart from a more accurate estimation, the experimental method helps in understanding the CM current flow path in a grid-connected inverter in detail.\r\n\r\nThe output filter inductors are part of the CM and DM noise paths. At conducted EMI frequencies, their impedance behaviour is influenced by high-frequency phenomena such as skin effect, proximity effect, inductances due to eddy currents and parasitic capacitances. These effects lead to alternate parallel-series resonances, as observed in impedance analyzer plots. This work proposes a simplified high-frequency model incorporating these effects for amorphous core filter inductors. The proposed model is easy to simulate and provides good accuracy without the need for complex numerical methods.\r\n\r\nThe high-frequency models, identified sources and high-frequency current flow paths are expected to be useful in designing the EMI filters for grid-connected inverters.','EEOffice','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web conference link',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-19 06:30:12','Active'),(1438,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','Almost sharp lower bound for the nodal volume of harmonic functions','Dr. Lakshmi Priya M E','Lakshmi Priya M E is presently at the School of Mathematics, Tel Aviv University, Israel.

For these patients, a heart transplant becomes the only viable option if they fail optimal medical treatment, as they are not suitable candidates for long-term mechanical circulatory support. Medical management of these patients involves lowering the systemic afterload with vasodilator drugs while awaiting a transplant. We hypothesised that when venous pressure is elevated before transplant, vasodilation increases cardiac output but leads to a significant drop in mean perfusion pressure (the difference between mean arterial pressure and venous pressure), resulting in compromised end-organ function and consequent unfavourable outcomes even after heart transplantation. To investigate our research hypothesis, we utilised pre-transplant clinical data from 250 heart transplant recipients, along with their post-transplant survival information and employed a sophisticated mathematical model to simulate cardiovascular hemodynamics. Our research found that low mean perfusion pressure is a risk factor for post-transplant survival in patients with high venous pressure due to end-organ dysfunction, especially in those with a higher body surface area. The mathematical model demonstrated that in biventricular dysfunction with high venous pressure, vasodilation increases the cardiac output but lowers the mean perfusion pressure significantly, particularly in patients with higher body surface area. Adding an intra-aortic balloon pump counter-pulsation to vasodilation increases cardiac output while maintaining perfusion pressure simultaneously and confers a substantial hemodynamic benefit in this setting. These findings emphasise the importance of reevaluating vasodilator therapy guidelines in heart failure. Focusing on a more individualised therapeutic approach to vasodilation that considers venous pressure and body surface area, in addition to the already established patient-specific factor of systolic blood pressure, is crucial to improve patient outcomes. Transitioning from analysis of heart transplantation outcomes, the subsequent phase of our research focuses on improving the diagnosis of heart failure patients through hemodynamic monitoring. We have developed a mathematical model-based approach to non-invasively predict the patient-specific left ventricular pressure-volume loop in the ICU setting, and it was validated in silico. While these results are promising, future clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings in actual patients. This study is a valuable proof of concept for designing and implementing such clinical trials.','EDOffice','edoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web conference link',NULL,NULL,1,'2024-10-19 06:30:22','Active');
