The quantum\r\nextremal island method investigates the information paradox within lower-dimensional\r\nGaussâ€“Bonnet gravity, specifically focusing on a three-dimensional EGB black hole.\r\nAlso, we employ the island prescription to explore the information paradox within\r\nnon-AdS spacetime, specifically in the context of warped Anti-de Sitter black holes. We\r\nare examining eternal black holes which do not undergo evaporation. These black holes\r\nare connected to an external reservoir, facilitating the radiation reaching the boundary.\r\nThrough this process black holes can completely evaporate and disappear. The results\r\nindicate that initially, the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation exhibits a linear\r\ngrowth with time, eventually becoming unbounded later. However, when accounting for\r\nthe emergence of an island later and just beyond the event horizon, the growth in the\r\nentanglement entropy of Hawking radiation stabilizes at a constant value. This constant\r\nvalue is precisely twice the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We also examine the Page time\r\nand the Scrambling time and their dependence on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second part, we examine a quantum field propagating within a spacetime generated\r\nby a specific Z2 quotient of the BTZ black hole. We investigate how the presence of the\r\nmatter field influences the spacetime geometry, considering linear perturbations in the\r\nmetric. The exact computation of the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor is\r\nachievable by evaluating its pull-back onto the covering space. By selecting appropriate\r\nboundary conditions for the quantum field along a non-contractible cycle of the quotient\r\nmanifold, it becomes feasible to achieve a negative average energy along a null geodesic,\r\nforming a traversable wormhole.\r\n','HoD Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-03 06:19:05','Active'),(3,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\"Carbone [(L)2C(0)] Based Complexes Towards Dinitrogen Activation and Catalysisâ€','Ms. Madhuri Bhattacharya (CY21D094)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide- Dr. Kartik Chandra Mondal, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/08 15:00','2024-04-08','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','Nitrogen fixation by the reduction of N2 to NH3 is a requisite transformation for life. This can be done on a vast scale by the industrial Haberâ€“Bosch (HB) process using Mittasch catalyst at very high temperature (300ËšC) and pressure (100 bar), but in nature by nitrogenase enzymes present in certain micro-organisms under ambient conditions. Researchers have attempted to mimic nitrogenase, but due to the complex mechanism of N2 activation and inertness of N2, have met with limited success[1]. \r\nFor N2 activation, metalâ€“N Ï€-backbonding plays a crucial role. Higher the electron density on the metal, higher will be the backbonding. In this regard, carbone [(L)2C(0)] having two lone pairs of electrons, is a strong Ïƒ- and Ï€-donor ligand enhancing the electron density on the metal. Now carbodiphosphorane (CDP) is a particular type of carbone where L = phosphine. Although there are several works on expensive late transition metal and coinage metal carbone complexes[2]; early transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni) complexes, which are comparably cheaper, remain challenging to synthesis due to instability. Here I will be proposing different CDP ligands based 3d-transition metal complexes which can be implemented for N2 binding as expected from the theoretical calculations done by our group. Such strong electron donor ligands can stabilise coordinatively unsaturated metal centers, promoting catalysis[3]. In this seminar, an extensive presentation of carbodiphosphorane chemistry and itâ€™s metal complexes synthesized to date will be discussed, followed by my work done and the future perspective.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

For example, developing a new drug costs an average of 2.6 billion U.S. dollars and takes approximately a decade. Traditional computer-aided drug design methods are still ineffective due to the enormous size of the chemical space of drugs (estimated to be in the order of $10^{60}$) to be explored. Moreover, successfully designing a molecule for a particular context is just one piece of the puzzle. Once a potential lead molecule with optimized properties is generated, to realize its full therapeutic potential, a robust, economical, and sustainable pathway for synthesizing the molecule must be designed for practical application. Recent successes of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in different domains encourage us to investigate domain-specific generative and multimodal AI\'s role in solving the ``De-Novo Drug Discovery\" and ``Novel Reaction Pathway Discovery\" problems. In this presentation, we discuss our approach to addressing the prediction of drug properties, molecule generation, and synthesis pathway design, leveraging the power of AI in conjunction with domain knowledge. By harnessing various biochemical modalities such as sequences, 3D structures, and pathway networks, our method allows us to improve the pace of drug discovery and facilitates the sustainable production of a broader spectrum of compounds. We will highlight results from our work on developing chemistry-inspired interpretable representations for molecular property prediction and a de-novo molecule generation framework using Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we explore the integration of multiple biological modalities and capitalize on their synergies for synthesis pathway generation.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-04 03:44:01','Active'),(11,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Design, optimization, and experimental verification of superficial hyperthermia treatment of cancer using near-field microstrip patch antennas and ultrasound tissue thermometry.','Mr. Muthu Rattina Subash, ED19D700','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Engineering Design.','Dr.   Nilesh J Vasa (Chair)\r\n\r\nDr. Kavitha Arunachalam  (Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Arun K Thittai, AM (Co-Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Tuhin Subhra Santra,\r\n\r\nDr. M Ramasubba Reddy, AM','Department of Engineering Design','2024/04/04 15:00','2024-04-04','','ED107 ( Cybernetic Center)',' Hyperthermia is an adjuvant cancer treatment that elevates tumor temperature to 40-\r\n45 â„ƒ for 60-minute duration.

These low-dimensional materials exhibit a strong Coulomb interaction owing to reduced dielectric screening, resulting in stable excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) at room temperature [1,2]. In this work, we have studied the 2D oxide material Î±-MoO3 and its heterostructure with other TMDC materials. Our primary objective is to investigate many-body complexes, such as excitons and trions, for excitonic-based device applications. The Î±-MoO3 is a unique 2D oxide semiconductor that has recently gained immense potential in the field of optoelectronics because of its high workfunction (~6.0â€‰eV) and band gap (~3.0 eV) [3]. A large workfunction enables spontaneous electron transfer from most 2D materials to Î±-MoO3 in a heterostructure design, making Î±-MoO3 a viable candidate for designing self-driven photodetectors and hole transport layers in solar cells [3]. Our initial study was devoted to examining the charge transfer in the Î±-MoO3/MoS2 heterostructure and the subsequent formation of positive trions composed of one electron and two holes at low temperatures [4]. These trions are electrically controllable and contain information about energy, charge, and spin  [1]. In the next part of the work, we utilized H+-ion irradiation to tune the photoluminescence (PL) emission of Î±-MoO3 in a visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum  [5]. In addition, we have observed that the as-grown Î±-MoO3 crystals exhibit strong in-plane Raman anisotropy due to their low symmetric crystal structure. Furthermore, in-plane Raman anisotropy has been characterized by angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy, and the degree of anisotropy in Î±-MoO3 is quantified, which will be helpful for designing polarization-sensitive photonic devices. In the Final part of the work, we demonstrated the selective tuning of memristive characteristics of Î±-MoO3 through synthesizing two distinct single crystal types (referred to as type-I&II) using the physical vapor deposition technique.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1]	T.

Local scour around piers is a major cause of bridge failures. This research aimed to study the effect of (i) pier shape, (ii) footing geometry on local scour depth, and (iii) the flow field, turbulence, and scouring around different-shaped piers. The effect of pier shape on the scour depth is investigated using circular (M1) (diameter, D = 5 cm) and two modified pier shapes (M2 and M3), where M2 is a combination of semi-circle and triangle oriented either way (M2a and M2b), and M3 is a further modification to M2a with a small protrusion on the semi-circular end. The results showed that the scour depth for M2a, M2b, and M3 piers is reduced by 23.5%, 50%, and 55% compared to the M1. However, the scour depth increases if a skew angle is imposed. Also, tests with the piers in tandem showed that M1 as front pier and M2a as rear pier spaced at 1.0D, and M1 as rear pier and M3 as front pier spaced at 1.75D produced the least scour depths. The sensitivity analysis shows skew angle and flow velocity are the most influential parameters.\r\nBridge foundations can be exposed to flow due to long-term riverbed degradation, which affects the scour around compound piers. Experiments are conducted using a compound pier with pier diameter D and footing diameter (Df = 2D) located at different elevations. The footing at or just below the riverbed reduced the scour depths up to 57% than the pier alone, while those projecting into the flow aided scouring. Footing diameter and flow depth are the key parameters influencing scour depth prediction. Further, flow field, turbulence, and scouring around different-shaped piers are studied through 3-D velocity measurements, revealing the shielding effect of footing from the impact of downflow and horseshoe vortices in reducing scour depth around compound piers. The distribution of velocities, Reynolds shear stresses, turbulent kinetic energy, vorticity, and bed shear stresses around each pier model are studied. The developed M5 models for estimating scour depth around different-shaped piers are accurate (R2 > 0.85) than existing scour equations. This research proposes efficient pier shapes for scour reduction and contributes to safe bridge designs.','G Mathangi','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-04 12:21:03','Active'),(47,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Dynamics and control of an underwater glider','Mr.Kumar Vaibhav, Roll No: OE21S002','Mr.Kumar Vaibhav, Roll No: OE21S002, MS Scholar.','Guide: Dr. Suresh Rajendran, Department of Ocean Engineering.','OCEAN ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT','2024/04/05 16:00','2024-04-05','','Seminar Hall, Department of Ocean Engineering','The research is divided into two main sections.

To achieve path following of an underwater glider (taken as a point mass model), a virtual target method is used. The primary objective of path following is to obtain control inputs that allow the glider to converge to the desired path with high accuracy and minimum control input. To achieve this, the path following problem is first converted into an optimal control problem, and a pseudo-spectral (PS) framework is employed to solve it. Finally, the study concludes with the implementation of control inputs derived from the PS framework into a 6 DOF glider model.','OCEAN ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-05 03:30:28','Active'),(48,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','A Systematic Analysis of the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 Using Uncertainty Quantification','Hariharan R K (ch21s006)','Hariharan R K (ch21s006) MS Scholars','Guide : Dr. Himanshu Goyal','Department of Chemical Engineering','2024/04/05 17:00','2024-04-05','yes','online','\r\nA Systematic Analysis of the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 Using Uncertainty Quantification\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nElectrochemical reduction of CO2 has emerged as a promising technology to combat climate change. Despite significant advancements in catalyst materials and electrolyzer optimization, translating this progress into practical applications is challenging due to the system\'s complex multiphase and multiscale nature, particularly under industrially relevant conditions. To develop more accurate models, accounting for uncertainties in the physical system is crucial, ranging from estimating kinetic parameters to biases in transport parameters. In this study, we perform uncertainty quantification of an electrochemical cell model validated against experimental data. We explore the uncertainties associated with the input model parameters and compare them with the experimental measurements, assessing the reliability of the model predictions. Our analysis also sheds light on the contribution of different parameters to the variation in current density predictions, which can help build confidence in the model. By quantifying the biases and uncertainties in model parameters, we can develop more accurate models, which could accelerate the translation of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into practical applications.\r\n\r\n','K P GEETHA','choffice','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/nmq-khdy-avs','','',1,'2024-04-05 05:04:24','Active'),(49,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Optimization of utility-based shortfall risk: A non-asymptotic viewpoint','Mr. Sumedh Sunil Gupte, Roll No: CS21D014','Ph.D. Research Scholar','Dr. Sutanu Chakraborti - DC Chair,\r\nDr. Prashanth L A - Guide,\r\nDr. Sanjay P Bhat - Co-Guide - EE,\r\nDC Members:\r\nDr. Mitesh Khapra - CSE,\r\nDr. Harish Guruprasad - CSE,\r\nDr. Abhishek Sinha - EE.','Computer Science and Engineering','2024/04/10 11:00','2024-04-10','','A M Turing Hall (SSB 334, Second Floor)','We consider the problems of estimation and optimization of utility-based shortfall risk (UBSR), which is a popular risk measure in finance.

Next, in the context of UBSR optimization, we derive an expression for the UBSR gradient under a smooth parametrization. This expression is a ratio of expectations, both of which involve the UBSR. We use SAA for the numerator as well as denominator in the UBSR gradient expression to arrive at a biased gradient estimator. We derive non-asymptotic bounds on the estimation error, which show that our gradient estimator is asymptotically unbiased. We incorporate the aforementioned gradient estimator into a stochastic gradient (SG) algorithm for UBSR optimization.

Hydrogen is one of such alternatives; however, it will be environmentally and economically sustainable only when it is generated by using a renewable source such as solar energy. The photoelectrochemocal approach of generating hydrogen from splitting of water is an attractive option provided the photoative materials yield optimum efficiency of light absorption, photocarrier generation and reaction kinectics. In practice, no single material can achieve the desired qualities and hence the heterojunction approach has been investigated. In the proposed work, heterojunction between two metal oxide components will be fabricated in such a way that the resulting material configuration not only achieves a desired alignment of the energy bands (to help charge seperation) but also yield a high specific surface area for enhanced catalytic activity. Metal oxide nanostructures will first be fabricated using chemical techniques followed by the deposition of an overlayer with Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) technique. The basic characterization for crystallinity, microstructure, morphology, composition and optical and electronic properties will be discussed. Finally, specific investigation proposals for the heterojunction and water splitting experiments will be presented.

This is \r\nachieved through strategic utilization of transformation-induced plasticity associated with \r\nretained austenite. Hence, ensuring precise tailoring of retained austenite content, morphology \r\nand size is crucial for Q&P steels. The current research work introduces a novel processing \r\ntechnique involving a combination of hot rolling and a direct quench and partitioning \r\ntreatments to produce an ultra-high strength, low-carbon and lean-composition steel with \r\nsuperior mechanical properties and enhanced stretch flangeability. The methodology involves \r\nthe introduction of a secondary partitioning step after a one-step direct quenching and \r\npartitioning (DQP) process. A detailed investigations on microstructures, tensile properties and \r\nstretch flangeability (using hole expansion testing) were carried out. The martensite-austenite \r\ntwo phase microstructure resulted in a remarkably improved product of strength and elongation \r\n(PSE, 24 GPa.%), the hole expansion ratio of 45% and a total elongation of 21.7%. It is shown \r\nthat the stability of retained austenite, rather than its volume fraction, has a significant impact \r\non the strain hardening rate, and therefore influences strength, ductility and stretch \r\nflangeability. The results indicate that tailoring retained austenite stability is essential for \r\noptimizing the mechanical performance and stretch flangeability of quenched and partitioned \r\nsteels. Introducing secondary partitioning into the Q&P process provides a feasibility to \r\nachieve a large fraction of total retained austenite, (predominantly film-type, along with smallsized blocky retained austenite islands in the microstructure), which results in high-strength \r\nQ&P steels with excellent global and local formability.\r\nKeywords: Quenching and Partitioning Steels; Austenite; Formability; Secondary \r\nPartitioning; Stretch-flangeability','MME Office','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-05 08:21:07','Active'),(52,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Reframing Childhood: Figuration of the Child in American Independent Cinema','Mr. Arjun Anil Bhaskar.','Ph.D Research Scholar, HS20D002','Prof. Aysha Viswamohan (Guide), Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras.','HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES','2024/04/24 17:15','2024-04-24','','Online  [Google meet.google.com/qji-wbaj-efq]','This research investigates the representation of childhood in contemporary American Independent cinema and reimagines the pluralities in the portrayal as a form of resistance towards the totalizing narratives of childhood in America.

Within the American cultural imaginary, particularly mainstream Hollywood, the distinction given to childhood has become ubiquitous, creating â€˜hyperrealâ€™ idealizations of innocence, vulnerability, and dependency, with children often perceived as embryonic adults.\r\n\r\nDrawing on the theories of Baudrillard, Bourdieu, Jameson and Butler, the attempt is to deconstruct the representational strategies underpinning the depiction of the child image in select filmic texts.

Furthermore, this research aims to discern the multifaceted modalities through which Independent cinema engages with and reimagines the child subject within the evolving cultural landscape of America.

This study focuses on a divergent 2-stage supply chain encompassing a distributor and multiple retailers. Unfulfilled demands at the retailer are considered lost sales, while unmet demand is considered backordering at the distributor. The objective is to identify the optimal continuous review inventory ordering policy for a multi-period problem integrated with routing strategies, aiming to maximize the Total Supply Chain Profit (TSCP) over a finite planning horizon. This research incorporates real-world complexities in perishable products inventory management, such as demand uncertainty, price-dependent demand, markdown prices, and inventory rationing. A hybrid continuous review (s, S, $\\beta$, Q) inventory policy, commonly used in blood inventory management, is proposed for other perishable products such as fruits, vegetables, and dairy products and benchmarked against established continuous review policies, including (s, Q), (s, S), and (s, S, q, Q), all integrated with inventory routing. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid policy surpasses classical and hybrid continuous review policies regarding total supply chain profit when combined with routing and other complexities. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis explores variations in results with changing model parameters, such as time horizon, product shelf-life, demand distributions, and lead-time settings.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','MS SEMINAR-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-05 13:42:32','Active'),(55,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','When surfaces matter: how nano-scaled surface features effect macro-scale transport','Prof. Gary Rosengarten, Mechanical Engineering at RMIT, Australia','Professor Gary Rosengarten is Director of the Sustainable Technologies and Systems Enabling Impact Platform at RMIT University, and leader of the Laboratory for Innovative Fluid Thermal Systems in Mechanical Engineering.\r\n\r\nBefore deciding on an academic career, he spent 3 years at Australiaâ€™s National research laboratory, CSIRO, and 2 years as an Engineering consultant in sustainable building design.\r\n\r\nHe completed a double honours degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering at Monash University and a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the University of New South Wales.\r\n\r\nHe applies his research expertise in thermofluids and energy systems, to help solve a wide variety of problems, particularly in energy storage, solar energy, thermal control, energy efficiency, and biosystems, working closely with interdisciplinary teams from academia and industry.\r\n\r\nHe has developed solar absorbers using radiative selective surfaces and is one of the pioneers of solar spectral splitting using vo','Host Faculty: Prof. Arvind Pattamatta, ME, IITM','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/04/08 15:00','2024-04-08','yes','Hybrid Mode: MSB 211 & through Google Meet link:- https://meet.google.com/vkv-qoct-mzw','Typical heat transfer correlations or surface property data assume that surfaces are smooth or that they donâ€™t affect transport properties such as convection or radiation. \r\nHowever micro to nano-scaled features can have a massive effect on many  macroscale continuum transport properties.\r\nIn this presentation I will showcase some of our work on a simple and cheap chemical method to create superhydrophilic copper surfaces that we apply to copper foams to significantly enhance capillarity- primary for heat pipe wicks,   surface metamaterials for selective solar thermal absorbers and superhydrophobic surfaces for enhanced spray cooling heat transfer rates.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/vkv-qoct-mzw','','',1,'2024-04-08 01:33:27','Active'),(56,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Evaluating Critical Influencing Factors for Indiaâ€™s Transition to a Gas based Economy Using Multi-Agent Supply Chain Models','MR.

The \r\nAsia-Pacific region accounts for almost 65% of the global LNG demand. There was a 4.5% \r\ngrowth in global LNG consumption in 2022 compared to 2021. A substantial increase in NG \r\nconsumption is forecasted in China and India at 7% and 4%, respectively, compared to the \r\n2022-2023 levels. Further, to ensure energy security3, it is imperative to plan investments and \r\nestablish a gas supply chain (SC) infrastructure based on the forecasted end-use uptake. Thus, \r\nhere we seek to develop a systematic framework for planning gas SC infrastructure to \r\nenable large developing countries like India to plan optimal national-level supply chain \r\nnetworks for natural gas. \r\nExisting energy transition literature emphasizes the role of government policy and \r\ntechnological innovation, while little has been written to integrate â€œtop-downâ€ approaches \r\nencompassing government policy and â€œbottom-upâ€ individual enterprise-level decisions. \r\nTherefore, here we develop a hybrid top-down, bottom-up production-consumption model \r\ntowards intra-national energy transition planning using a decentralized agent-based approach, \r\nincluding a detailed geographic coverage utilizing GIS to map individual energy units. This \r\nenables the SC-level dynamics of end-users to be considered when pursuing economic \r\nobjectives subject to regulatory constraints.  \r\nThe NG supply chain comprises natural gas production sites, floating storage and \r\nregasification units (FSRUs), and LNG import and regasification terminals as the suppliers, \r\npipeline grids supplemented by virtual pipelines based on road or rail transport as \r\ninfrastructure, and end-users who use gas as fuel or feedstock as the consumers. In large \r\ncountries such as India, estimating the demand for NG would necessitate estimating the landed \r\nprice of gas for each end-user. A key component of the landed price is the supply chain cost, \r\nwith significant spatio-temporal dependence. Gas pipelines are the cheapest means to transport \r\nNG over long distances but are economically viable only for large quantities. Road and rail\r\nbased virtual pipelines have higher unit shipping costs. However, they are economically \r\nattractive for smaller demands and shorter distances. This intricate interplay between \r\n1 \r\ndemand and economics of NG makes planning the supply chain at the national level a \r\nchallenging yet critical problem for developing national policies and studying related \r\neconomics.  \r\nThe proposed methodology comprises two distinct models â€“ an agent-based \r\nProduction Consumption Model (PCM) to assess the spatially distributed demand for NG \r\nand an Infrastructure Planning Model (IPM) to estimate the logistics costs of transporting \r\ngas from the various supply nodes to the demand centers. NG suppliers (LNG regasification \r\nterminals and NG production facilities) and end-users are distributed spatially and, along with \r\nlogistic providers, are modeled as rational, self-interested decision-making entities in PCM. \r\nEach end-user agent may desire to switch to an alternate fuel at a future time, subject to \r\navailability, affordability, and national environmental regulations. Capital expenditure on \r\nbuilding pipelines is estimated through the IPM, considering factors like geographic location \r\n(e.g., presence of terrains and water bodies).  \r\nIn this work, we present the application of the integrated simulation-optimization model \r\nin estimating demand for NG from 2022 to 2042 across Pan India, along with planning the \r\nnecessary infrastructure to meet the demand. The model comprises over ~2100 spatially \r\ndistributed end-users, including large power plants, refineries, fertilizer units, petrochemicals, \r\nas well as city gas distributors across various urban centers. The spatiotemporal demand and \r\nSC infrastructure evolution of NG arising from these end-users\' decisions over the 20-year \r\nhorizon are estimated by the model for different market and policy scenarios. Our results \r\nfeaturing natural gas usage across India suggest the power and city gas sectors to be the \r\nconsistent demand drivers, with their share rising from ~40% of the total in 2022 to ~60% by \r\n2032. This is consistent with IEA and IRENA projections.  The proposed agent-based model \r\nthus provides multiple benefits: It enables the identification of key sectors driving the \r\nenergy transition; it helps analyze critical factors like resource availability, supply chain \r\ninfrastructure, and economics; and it can be used to develop decision support tools to \r\ninvestigate clean energy policies. \r\nKeywords: production-consumption model; supply chain dynamics; technology switch; clean \r\nand low carbon fuel; strategic decisions ','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/sco-xuwj-tcp','seminar08-04-2024 03:32','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar08-04-2024 03:32',1,'2024-04-08 03:32:46','Active'),(57,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','â€œSCREENING OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLASTIC WASTES TO EVALUATE RESOURCE RECOVERY POTENTIAL THROUGH ANALYTICAL PYROLYSIS','MR.

Among various anthropogenic waste materials, plastic waste has been a promising source of energy and feedstock recovery, and their conversion into valuable fuels and platform chemicals can promote sustainable management and utilization of plastic solid wastes and circular economy. Ocean debris comprises 80% of plastic waste which also can be used as a source of energy and feedstock recovery. The present study aims at collection of beach plastic wastes from the sea shore in Chennai, India, and characterizations are done to determine their composition and polymer types. The quantification of pyrolysis vapours (pyrolysates) was carried out to determine the resource and monomer recovery potential in perspectives to petrochemical industries. Moreover, the study is also focused on in-depth characterization of post-consumer multi-layered plastic packaging waste (MLPW) by various methods such as thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, bomb calorimetry, proximate and ultimate analyses. Further, based on the chemical composition of the MLPW, its non-catalytic pyrolysis and zeolite-catalysed pyrolysis was studied. The activity of various conventional zeolites is evaluated and the salient process conditions like pyrolysis temperature and feed-to-catalyst ratio are optimized for the maximum yield of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) in the pyrolysates.

In this seminar, we explore leveraging the spatial cues in sound and vision to solve two problems:  generating immersive binaural audio for videos and 360Â° depth estimation.\r\n\r\n     In the first part of the seminar, we explore the problem of generating binaural audio (two-channel) for videos, even if they only have regular monaural (single-channel) audio. These binaural videos provide a more immersive video experience for users. Such videos are more immersive, enhancing user experience. Here, we tackle a more difficult version of this problem by synthesizing binaural audio for a video with monaural audio in a weakly semi-supervised setting (in the absence of a lot of annotated data).  Our approach relies on using any downstream task that requires binaural audio as a proxy for supervision, reducing the need for explicit supervision. In this work, we use Sound Source Localization with only audio as a proxy task for weak supervision. Using this proxy task as supervision, we leverage the visual cues to understand where sounds are coming from in the scene and infuse them into audio to create a realistic 3D audio effect. \r\n\r\n    In the second part of the seminar, we explore how sound, along with RGB images, can be leveraged to improve the depth map of the scene. We experiment with echoes, which are sound reflections from the environment. Given that the echoes encode room geometry, it is possible to reconstruct the 3D room geometry, thereby depth, from echoes. We investigate how echoes, along with limited camera views, can be used to create a complete 3D depth map of a surrounding environment. This technique enables us to estimate 360Â° depth perception with limited camera views and gives spatial awareness even if we can\'t see everything around us. Our experiments demonstrate that echoes can significantly improve depth estimation accuracy, particularly for 360Â° cameras. Furthermore, the use of audio-visual information together provides a complementary approach to estimating 360Â° depth maps with limited information.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/eia-gxsb-tiu','','',1,'2024-04-08 08:21:55','Active'),(62,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Metal-organic framework and coordination polymer-based materials for supercapacitor applications','Mr. Tapan Kumar Ghosh(CY17D015)','Ph.

The proposed approach involves fitting kappa and GEV distributions to model daily variations and extreme values, followed by PcStream clustering to categorize streamflow data based on the probability distribution of flows. A Markov chain model is then employed to regenerate cluster series, and the nearest neighbour approach is used to fill the cluster series with historical data. The flow series is classified into rising, falling, or constant phases, and these phases are simulated to generate synthetic streamflow series that closely mirror observed dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by comparing observed and simulated flow statistics across various streamflow gage stations. Results show that the model successfully reproduces seasonal patterns, low flows, high flow extremes, autocorrelations, and flow duration curves. The approach captures the nuances of streamflow pulses by explicitly modeling rising, falling, and constant flow phases based on state classifications. The flexibility of PcStream to fine-tune its parameters allows for tailored clustering that accommodates the specific characteristics of streamflow data. This study introduces a sophisticated tool for understanding and predicting the complex dynamics of hydrological systems, integrating statistical modeling, unsupervised machine learning, and temporal sequence analysis to simulate complete streamflow series. The proposed multistep methodology offers a new approach for generating synthetic yet realistic streamflow scenarios, thereby enhancing water resource planning and management in an ever-changing environment.','R.
