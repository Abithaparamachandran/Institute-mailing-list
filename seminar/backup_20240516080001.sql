The quantum\r\nextremal island method investigates the information paradox within lower-dimensional\r\nGaussâ€“Bonnet gravity, specifically focusing on a three-dimensional EGB black hole.\r\nAlso, we employ the island prescription to explore the information paradox within\r\nnon-AdS spacetime, specifically in the context of warped Anti-de Sitter black holes. We\r\nare examining eternal black holes which do not undergo evaporation. These black holes\r\nare connected to an external reservoir, facilitating the radiation reaching the boundary.\r\nThrough this process black holes can completely evaporate and disappear. The results\r\nindicate that initially, the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation exhibits a linear\r\ngrowth with time, eventually becoming unbounded later. However, when accounting for\r\nthe emergence of an island later and just beyond the event horizon, the growth in the\r\nentanglement entropy of Hawking radiation stabilizes at a constant value. This constant\r\nvalue is precisely twice the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We also examine the Page time\r\nand the Scrambling time and their dependence on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second part, we examine a quantum field propagating within a spacetime generated\r\nby a specific Z2 quotient of the BTZ black hole. We investigate how the presence of the\r\nmatter field influences the spacetime geometry, considering linear perturbations in the\r\nmetric. The exact computation of the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor is\r\nachievable by evaluating its pull-back onto the covering space. By selecting appropriate\r\nboundary conditions for the quantum field along a non-contractible cycle of the quotient\r\nmanifold, it becomes feasible to achieve a negative average energy along a null geodesic,\r\nforming a traversable wormhole.\r\n','HoD Office','phoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-03 06:19:05','Active'),(3,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\"Carbone [(L)2C(0)] Based Complexes Towards Dinitrogen Activation and Catalysisâ€','Ms. Madhuri Bhattacharya (CY21D094)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide- Dr. Kartik Chandra Mondal, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/08 15:00','2024-04-08','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','Nitrogen fixation by the reduction of N2 to NH3 is a requisite transformation for life. This can be done on a vast scale by the industrial Haberâ€“Bosch (HB) process using Mittasch catalyst at very high temperature (300ËšC) and pressure (100 bar), but in nature by nitrogenase enzymes present in certain micro-organisms under ambient conditions. Researchers have attempted to mimic nitrogenase, but due to the complex mechanism of N2 activation and inertness of N2, have met with limited success[1]. \r\nFor N2 activation, metalâ€“N Ï€-backbonding plays a crucial role. Higher the electron density on the metal, higher will be the backbonding. In this regard, carbone [(L)2C(0)] having two lone pairs of electrons, is a strong Ïƒ- and Ï€-donor ligand enhancing the electron density on the metal. Now carbodiphosphorane (CDP) is a particular type of carbone where L = phosphine. Although there are several works on expensive late transition metal and coinage metal carbone complexes[2]; early transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni) complexes, which are comparably cheaper, remain challenging to synthesis due to instability. Here I will be proposing different CDP ligands based 3d-transition metal complexes which can be implemented for N2 binding as expected from the theoretical calculations done by our group. Such strong electron donor ligands can stabilise coordinatively unsaturated metal centers, promoting catalysis[3]. In this seminar, an extensive presentation of carbodiphosphorane chemistry and itâ€™s metal complexes synthesized to date will be discussed, followed by my work done and the future perspective.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

For example, developing a new drug costs an average of 2.6 billion U.S. dollars and takes approximately a decade. Traditional computer-aided drug design methods are still ineffective due to the enormous size of the chemical space of drugs (estimated to be in the order of $10^{60}$) to be explored. Moreover, successfully designing a molecule for a particular context is just one piece of the puzzle. Once a potential lead molecule with optimized properties is generated, to realize its full therapeutic potential, a robust, economical, and sustainable pathway for synthesizing the molecule must be designed for practical application. Recent successes of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in different domains encourage us to investigate domain-specific generative and multimodal AI\'s role in solving the ``De-Novo Drug Discovery\" and ``Novel Reaction Pathway Discovery\" problems. In this presentation, we discuss our approach to addressing the prediction of drug properties, molecule generation, and synthesis pathway design, leveraging the power of AI in conjunction with domain knowledge. By harnessing various biochemical modalities such as sequences, 3D structures, and pathway networks, our method allows us to improve the pace of drug discovery and facilitates the sustainable production of a broader spectrum of compounds. We will highlight results from our work on developing chemistry-inspired interpretable representations for molecular property prediction and a de-novo molecule generation framework using Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we explore the integration of multiple biological modalities and capitalize on their synergies for synthesis pathway generation.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-04 03:44:01','Active'),(11,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Design, optimization, and experimental verification of superficial hyperthermia treatment of cancer using near-field microstrip patch antennas and ultrasound tissue thermometry.','Mr. Muthu Rattina Subash, ED19D700','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Engineering Design.','Dr.   Nilesh J Vasa (Chair)\r\n\r\nDr. Kavitha Arunachalam  (Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Arun K Thittai, AM (Co-Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Tuhin Subhra Santra,\r\n\r\nDr. M Ramasubba Reddy, AM','Department of Engineering Design','2024/04/04 15:00','2024-04-04','','ED107 ( Cybernetic Center)',' Hyperthermia is an adjuvant cancer treatment that elevates tumor temperature to 40-\r\n45 â„ƒ for 60-minute duration.

These low-dimensional materials exhibit a strong Coulomb interaction owing to reduced dielectric screening, resulting in stable excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) at room temperature [1,2]. In this work, we have studied the 2D oxide material Î±-MoO3 and its heterostructure with other TMDC materials. Our primary objective is to investigate many-body complexes, such as excitons and trions, for excitonic-based device applications. The Î±-MoO3 is a unique 2D oxide semiconductor that has recently gained immense potential in the field of optoelectronics because of its high workfunction (~6.0â€‰eV) and band gap (~3.0 eV) [3]. A large workfunction enables spontaneous electron transfer from most 2D materials to Î±-MoO3 in a heterostructure design, making Î±-MoO3 a viable candidate for designing self-driven photodetectors and hole transport layers in solar cells [3]. Our initial study was devoted to examining the charge transfer in the Î±-MoO3/MoS2 heterostructure and the subsequent formation of positive trions composed of one electron and two holes at low temperatures [4]. These trions are electrically controllable and contain information about energy, charge, and spin  [1]. In the next part of the work, we utilized H+-ion irradiation to tune the photoluminescence (PL) emission of Î±-MoO3 in a visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum  [5]. In addition, we have observed that the as-grown Î±-MoO3 crystals exhibit strong in-plane Raman anisotropy due to their low symmetric crystal structure. Furthermore, in-plane Raman anisotropy has been characterized by angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy, and the degree of anisotropy in Î±-MoO3 is quantified, which will be helpful for designing polarization-sensitive photonic devices. In the Final part of the work, we demonstrated the selective tuning of memristive characteristics of Î±-MoO3 through synthesizing two distinct single crystal types (referred to as type-I&II) using the physical vapor deposition technique.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1]	T.

Local scour around piers is a major cause of bridge failures. This research aimed to study the effect of (i) pier shape, (ii) footing geometry on local scour depth, and (iii) the flow field, turbulence, and scouring around different-shaped piers. The effect of pier shape on the scour depth is investigated using circular (M1) (diameter, D = 5 cm) and two modified pier shapes (M2 and M3), where M2 is a combination of semi-circle and triangle oriented either way (M2a and M2b), and M3 is a further modification to M2a with a small protrusion on the semi-circular end. The results showed that the scour depth for M2a, M2b, and M3 piers is reduced by 23.5%, 50%, and 55% compared to the M1. However, the scour depth increases if a skew angle is imposed. Also, tests with the piers in tandem showed that M1 as front pier and M2a as rear pier spaced at 1.0D, and M1 as rear pier and M3 as front pier spaced at 1.75D produced the least scour depths. The sensitivity analysis shows skew angle and flow velocity are the most influential parameters.\r\nBridge foundations can be exposed to flow due to long-term riverbed degradation, which affects the scour around compound piers. Experiments are conducted using a compound pier with pier diameter D and footing diameter (Df = 2D) located at different elevations. The footing at or just below the riverbed reduced the scour depths up to 57% than the pier alone, while those projecting into the flow aided scouring. Footing diameter and flow depth are the key parameters influencing scour depth prediction. Further, flow field, turbulence, and scouring around different-shaped piers are studied through 3-D velocity measurements, revealing the shielding effect of footing from the impact of downflow and horseshoe vortices in reducing scour depth around compound piers. The distribution of velocities, Reynolds shear stresses, turbulent kinetic energy, vorticity, and bed shear stresses around each pier model are studied. The developed M5 models for estimating scour depth around different-shaped piers are accurate (R2 > 0.85) than existing scour equations. This research proposes efficient pier shapes for scour reduction and contributes to safe bridge designs.','G Mathangi','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-04 12:21:03','Active'),(47,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Dynamics and control of an underwater glider','Mr.Kumar Vaibhav, Roll No: OE21S002','Mr.Kumar Vaibhav, Roll No: OE21S002, MS Scholar.','Guide: Dr. Suresh Rajendran, Department of Ocean Engineering.','OCEAN ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT','2024/04/05 16:00','2024-04-05','','Seminar Hall, Department of Ocean Engineering','The research is divided into two main sections.

To achieve path following of an underwater glider (taken as a point mass model), a virtual target method is used. The primary objective of path following is to obtain control inputs that allow the glider to converge to the desired path with high accuracy and minimum control input. To achieve this, the path following problem is first converted into an optimal control problem, and a pseudo-spectral (PS) framework is employed to solve it. Finally, the study concludes with the implementation of control inputs derived from the PS framework into a 6 DOF glider model.','OCEAN ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-05 03:30:28','Active'),(48,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','A Systematic Analysis of the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 Using Uncertainty Quantification','Hariharan R K (ch21s006)','Hariharan R K (ch21s006) MS Scholars','Guide : Dr. Himanshu Goyal','Department of Chemical Engineering','2024/04/05 17:00','2024-04-05','yes','online','\r\nA Systematic Analysis of the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 Using Uncertainty Quantification\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nElectrochemical reduction of CO2 has emerged as a promising technology to combat climate change. Despite significant advancements in catalyst materials and electrolyzer optimization, translating this progress into practical applications is challenging due to the system\'s complex multiphase and multiscale nature, particularly under industrially relevant conditions. To develop more accurate models, accounting for uncertainties in the physical system is crucial, ranging from estimating kinetic parameters to biases in transport parameters. In this study, we perform uncertainty quantification of an electrochemical cell model validated against experimental data. We explore the uncertainties associated with the input model parameters and compare them with the experimental measurements, assessing the reliability of the model predictions. Our analysis also sheds light on the contribution of different parameters to the variation in current density predictions, which can help build confidence in the model. By quantifying the biases and uncertainties in model parameters, we can develop more accurate models, which could accelerate the translation of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into practical applications.\r\n\r\n','K P GEETHA','choffice','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/nmq-khdy-avs','','',1,'2024-04-05 05:04:24','Active'),(49,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Optimization of utility-based shortfall risk: A non-asymptotic viewpoint','Mr. Sumedh Sunil Gupte, Roll No: CS21D014','Ph.D. Research Scholar','Dr. Sutanu Chakraborti - DC Chair,\r\nDr. Prashanth L A - Guide,\r\nDr. Sanjay P Bhat - Co-Guide - EE,\r\nDC Members:\r\nDr. Mitesh Khapra - CSE,\r\nDr. Harish Guruprasad - CSE,\r\nDr. Abhishek Sinha - EE.','Computer Science and Engineering','2024/04/10 11:00','2024-04-10','','A M Turing Hall (SSB 334, Second Floor)','We consider the problems of estimation and optimization of utility-based shortfall risk (UBSR), which is a popular risk measure in finance.

Next, in the context of UBSR optimization, we derive an expression for the UBSR gradient under a smooth parametrization. This expression is a ratio of expectations, both of which involve the UBSR. We use SAA for the numerator as well as denominator in the UBSR gradient expression to arrive at a biased gradient estimator. We derive non-asymptotic bounds on the estimation error, which show that our gradient estimator is asymptotically unbiased. We incorporate the aforementioned gradient estimator into a stochastic gradient (SG) algorithm for UBSR optimization.

Hydrogen is one of such alternatives; however, it will be environmentally and economically sustainable only when it is generated by using a renewable source such as solar energy. The photoelectrochemocal approach of generating hydrogen from splitting of water is an attractive option provided the photoative materials yield optimum efficiency of light absorption, photocarrier generation and reaction kinectics. In practice, no single material can achieve the desired qualities and hence the heterojunction approach has been investigated. In the proposed work, heterojunction between two metal oxide components will be fabricated in such a way that the resulting material configuration not only achieves a desired alignment of the energy bands (to help charge seperation) but also yield a high specific surface area for enhanced catalytic activity. Metal oxide nanostructures will first be fabricated using chemical techniques followed by the deposition of an overlayer with Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) technique. The basic characterization for crystallinity, microstructure, morphology, composition and optical and electronic properties will be discussed. Finally, specific investigation proposals for the heterojunction and water splitting experiments will be presented.

This is \r\nachieved through strategic utilization of transformation-induced plasticity associated with \r\nretained austenite. Hence, ensuring precise tailoring of retained austenite content, morphology \r\nand size is crucial for Q&P steels. The current research work introduces a novel processing \r\ntechnique involving a combination of hot rolling and a direct quench and partitioning \r\ntreatments to produce an ultra-high strength, low-carbon and lean-composition steel with \r\nsuperior mechanical properties and enhanced stretch flangeability. The methodology involves \r\nthe introduction of a secondary partitioning step after a one-step direct quenching and \r\npartitioning (DQP) process. A detailed investigations on microstructures, tensile properties and \r\nstretch flangeability (using hole expansion testing) were carried out. The martensite-austenite \r\ntwo phase microstructure resulted in a remarkably improved product of strength and elongation \r\n(PSE, 24 GPa.%), the hole expansion ratio of 45% and a total elongation of 21.7%. It is shown \r\nthat the stability of retained austenite, rather than its volume fraction, has a significant impact \r\non the strain hardening rate, and therefore influences strength, ductility and stretch \r\nflangeability. The results indicate that tailoring retained austenite stability is essential for \r\noptimizing the mechanical performance and stretch flangeability of quenched and partitioned \r\nsteels. Introducing secondary partitioning into the Q&P process provides a feasibility to \r\nachieve a large fraction of total retained austenite, (predominantly film-type, along with smallsized blocky retained austenite islands in the microstructure), which results in high-strength \r\nQ&P steels with excellent global and local formability.\r\nKeywords: Quenching and Partitioning Steels; Austenite; Formability; Secondary \r\nPartitioning; Stretch-flangeability','MME Office','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-05 08:21:07','Active'),(52,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Reframing Childhood: Figuration of the Child in American Independent Cinema','Mr. Arjun Anil Bhaskar.','Ph.D Research Scholar, HS20D002','Prof. Aysha Viswamohan (Guide), Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras.','HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES','2024/04/24 17:15','2024-04-24','','Online  [Google meet.google.com/qji-wbaj-efq]','This research investigates the representation of childhood in contemporary American Independent cinema and reimagines the pluralities in the portrayal as a form of resistance towards the totalizing narratives of childhood in America.

Within the American cultural imaginary, particularly mainstream Hollywood, the distinction given to childhood has become ubiquitous, creating â€˜hyperrealâ€™ idealizations of innocence, vulnerability, and dependency, with children often perceived as embryonic adults.\r\n\r\nDrawing on the theories of Baudrillard, Bourdieu, Jameson and Butler, the attempt is to deconstruct the representational strategies underpinning the depiction of the child image in select filmic texts.

Furthermore, this research aims to discern the multifaceted modalities through which Independent cinema engages with and reimagines the child subject within the evolving cultural landscape of America.

This study focuses on a divergent 2-stage supply chain encompassing a distributor and multiple retailers. Unfulfilled demands at the retailer are considered lost sales, while unmet demand is considered backordering at the distributor. The objective is to identify the optimal continuous review inventory ordering policy for a multi-period problem integrated with routing strategies, aiming to maximize the Total Supply Chain Profit (TSCP) over a finite planning horizon. This research incorporates real-world complexities in perishable products inventory management, such as demand uncertainty, price-dependent demand, markdown prices, and inventory rationing. A hybrid continuous review (s, S, $\\beta$, Q) inventory policy, commonly used in blood inventory management, is proposed for other perishable products such as fruits, vegetables, and dairy products and benchmarked against established continuous review policies, including (s, Q), (s, S), and (s, S, q, Q), all integrated with inventory routing. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid policy surpasses classical and hybrid continuous review policies regarding total supply chain profit when combined with routing and other complexities. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis explores variations in results with changing model parameters, such as time horizon, product shelf-life, demand distributions, and lead-time settings.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','MS SEMINAR-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-05 13:42:32','Active'),(55,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','When surfaces matter: how nano-scaled surface features effect macro-scale transport','Prof. Gary Rosengarten, Mechanical Engineering at RMIT, Australia','Professor Gary Rosengarten is Director of the Sustainable Technologies and Systems Enabling Impact Platform at RMIT University, and leader of the Laboratory for Innovative Fluid Thermal Systems in Mechanical Engineering.\r\n\r\nBefore deciding on an academic career, he spent 3 years at Australiaâ€™s National research laboratory, CSIRO, and 2 years as an Engineering consultant in sustainable building design.\r\n\r\nHe completed a double honours degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering at Monash University and a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the University of New South Wales.\r\n\r\nHe applies his research expertise in thermofluids and energy systems, to help solve a wide variety of problems, particularly in energy storage, solar energy, thermal control, energy efficiency, and biosystems, working closely with interdisciplinary teams from academia and industry.\r\n\r\nHe has developed solar absorbers using radiative selective surfaces and is one of the pioneers of solar spectral splitting using vo','Host Faculty: Prof. Arvind Pattamatta, ME, IITM','Department of Mechanical Engineering','2024/04/08 15:00','2024-04-08','yes','Hybrid Mode: MSB 211 & through Google Meet link:- https://meet.google.com/vkv-qoct-mzw','Typical heat transfer correlations or surface property data assume that surfaces are smooth or that they donâ€™t affect transport properties such as convection or radiation. \r\nHowever micro to nano-scaled features can have a massive effect on many  macroscale continuum transport properties.\r\nIn this presentation I will showcase some of our work on a simple and cheap chemical method to create superhydrophilic copper surfaces that we apply to copper foams to significantly enhance capillarity- primary for heat pipe wicks,   surface metamaterials for selective solar thermal absorbers and superhydrophobic surfaces for enhanced spray cooling heat transfer rates.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/vkv-qoct-mzw','','',1,'2024-04-08 01:33:27','Active'),(56,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Evaluating Critical Influencing Factors for Indiaâ€™s Transition to a Gas based Economy Using Multi-Agent Supply Chain Models','MR.

The \r\nAsia-Pacific region accounts for almost 65% of the global LNG demand. There was a 4.5% \r\ngrowth in global LNG consumption in 2022 compared to 2021. A substantial increase in NG \r\nconsumption is forecasted in China and India at 7% and 4%, respectively, compared to the \r\n2022-2023 levels. Further, to ensure energy security3, it is imperative to plan investments and \r\nestablish a gas supply chain (SC) infrastructure based on the forecasted end-use uptake. Thus, \r\nhere we seek to develop a systematic framework for planning gas SC infrastructure to \r\nenable large developing countries like India to plan optimal national-level supply chain \r\nnetworks for natural gas. \r\nExisting energy transition literature emphasizes the role of government policy and \r\ntechnological innovation, while little has been written to integrate â€œtop-downâ€ approaches \r\nencompassing government policy and â€œbottom-upâ€ individual enterprise-level decisions. \r\nTherefore, here we develop a hybrid top-down, bottom-up production-consumption model \r\ntowards intra-national energy transition planning using a decentralized agent-based approach, \r\nincluding a detailed geographic coverage utilizing GIS to map individual energy units. This \r\nenables the SC-level dynamics of end-users to be considered when pursuing economic \r\nobjectives subject to regulatory constraints.  \r\nThe NG supply chain comprises natural gas production sites, floating storage and \r\nregasification units (FSRUs), and LNG import and regasification terminals as the suppliers, \r\npipeline grids supplemented by virtual pipelines based on road or rail transport as \r\ninfrastructure, and end-users who use gas as fuel or feedstock as the consumers. In large \r\ncountries such as India, estimating the demand for NG would necessitate estimating the landed \r\nprice of gas for each end-user. A key component of the landed price is the supply chain cost, \r\nwith significant spatio-temporal dependence. Gas pipelines are the cheapest means to transport \r\nNG over long distances but are economically viable only for large quantities. Road and rail\r\nbased virtual pipelines have higher unit shipping costs. However, they are economically \r\nattractive for smaller demands and shorter distances. This intricate interplay between \r\n1 \r\ndemand and economics of NG makes planning the supply chain at the national level a \r\nchallenging yet critical problem for developing national policies and studying related \r\neconomics.  \r\nThe proposed methodology comprises two distinct models â€“ an agent-based \r\nProduction Consumption Model (PCM) to assess the spatially distributed demand for NG \r\nand an Infrastructure Planning Model (IPM) to estimate the logistics costs of transporting \r\ngas from the various supply nodes to the demand centers. NG suppliers (LNG regasification \r\nterminals and NG production facilities) and end-users are distributed spatially and, along with \r\nlogistic providers, are modeled as rational, self-interested decision-making entities in PCM. \r\nEach end-user agent may desire to switch to an alternate fuel at a future time, subject to \r\navailability, affordability, and national environmental regulations. Capital expenditure on \r\nbuilding pipelines is estimated through the IPM, considering factors like geographic location \r\n(e.g., presence of terrains and water bodies).  \r\nIn this work, we present the application of the integrated simulation-optimization model \r\nin estimating demand for NG from 2022 to 2042 across Pan India, along with planning the \r\nnecessary infrastructure to meet the demand. The model comprises over ~2100 spatially \r\ndistributed end-users, including large power plants, refineries, fertilizer units, petrochemicals, \r\nas well as city gas distributors across various urban centers. The spatiotemporal demand and \r\nSC infrastructure evolution of NG arising from these end-users\' decisions over the 20-year \r\nhorizon are estimated by the model for different market and policy scenarios. Our results \r\nfeaturing natural gas usage across India suggest the power and city gas sectors to be the \r\nconsistent demand drivers, with their share rising from ~40% of the total in 2022 to ~60% by \r\n2032. This is consistent with IEA and IRENA projections.  The proposed agent-based model \r\nthus provides multiple benefits: It enables the identification of key sectors driving the \r\nenergy transition; it helps analyze critical factors like resource availability, supply chain \r\ninfrastructure, and economics; and it can be used to develop decision support tools to \r\ninvestigate clean energy policies. \r\nKeywords: production-consumption model; supply chain dynamics; technology switch; clean \r\nand low carbon fuel; strategic decisions ','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/sco-xuwj-tcp','seminar08-04-2024 03:32','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar08-04-2024 03:32',1,'2024-04-08 03:32:46','Active'),(57,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','â€œSCREENING OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLASTIC WASTES TO EVALUATE RESOURCE RECOVERY POTENTIAL THROUGH ANALYTICAL PYROLYSIS','MR.

Among various anthropogenic waste materials, plastic waste has been a promising source of energy and feedstock recovery, and their conversion into valuable fuels and platform chemicals can promote sustainable management and utilization of plastic solid wastes and circular economy. Ocean debris comprises 80% of plastic waste which also can be used as a source of energy and feedstock recovery. The present study aims at collection of beach plastic wastes from the sea shore in Chennai, India, and characterizations are done to determine their composition and polymer types. The quantification of pyrolysis vapours (pyrolysates) was carried out to determine the resource and monomer recovery potential in perspectives to petrochemical industries. Moreover, the study is also focused on in-depth characterization of post-consumer multi-layered plastic packaging waste (MLPW) by various methods such as thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, bomb calorimetry, proximate and ultimate analyses. Further, based on the chemical composition of the MLPW, its non-catalytic pyrolysis and zeolite-catalysed pyrolysis was studied. The activity of various conventional zeolites is evaluated and the salient process conditions like pyrolysis temperature and feed-to-catalyst ratio are optimized for the maximum yield of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) in the pyrolysates.

In this seminar, we explore leveraging the spatial cues in sound and vision to solve two problems:  generating immersive binaural audio for videos and 360Â° depth estimation.\r\n\r\n     In the first part of the seminar, we explore the problem of generating binaural audio (two-channel) for videos, even if they only have regular monaural (single-channel) audio. These binaural videos provide a more immersive video experience for users. Such videos are more immersive, enhancing user experience. Here, we tackle a more difficult version of this problem by synthesizing binaural audio for a video with monaural audio in a weakly semi-supervised setting (in the absence of a lot of annotated data).  Our approach relies on using any downstream task that requires binaural audio as a proxy for supervision, reducing the need for explicit supervision. In this work, we use Sound Source Localization with only audio as a proxy task for weak supervision. Using this proxy task as supervision, we leverage the visual cues to understand where sounds are coming from in the scene and infuse them into audio to create a realistic 3D audio effect. \r\n\r\n    In the second part of the seminar, we explore how sound, along with RGB images, can be leveraged to improve the depth map of the scene. We experiment with echoes, which are sound reflections from the environment. Given that the echoes encode room geometry, it is possible to reconstruct the 3D room geometry, thereby depth, from echoes. We investigate how echoes, along with limited camera views, can be used to create a complete 3D depth map of a surrounding environment. This technique enables us to estimate 360Â° depth perception with limited camera views and gives spatial awareness even if we can\'t see everything around us. Our experiments demonstrate that echoes can significantly improve depth estimation accuracy, particularly for 360Â° cameras. Furthermore, the use of audio-visual information together provides a complementary approach to estimating 360Â° depth maps with limited information.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/eia-gxsb-tiu','','',1,'2024-04-08 08:21:55','Active'),(62,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Metal-organic framework and coordination polymer-based materials for supercapacitor applications','Mr. Tapan Kumar Ghosh(CY17D015)','Ph.

The framework of differential privacy renders analysis on the congregated data while ensuring that any individual\'s contribution to the dataset remains indistinguishable. Differential privacy is typically ensured by perturbation with additive noise that is sampled from a known distribution. In this talk, we will discuss an additive noise mechanism for differential privacy that adds noise sampled from a new noise density called flipped Huber distribution. It is a hybrid density that resembles Laplace in the centre and Gaussian in the tail. With a sharper centre and light, sub-Gaussian tail, this density has the best characteristics of both distributions and renders a better trade-off between privacy and accuracy than other existing mechanisms. We theoretically analyze the proposed mechanism, and we derive the necessary and sufficient condition in one dimension and a sufficient condition in high dimensions for the mechanism to guarantee (Ïµ,Î´)-differential privacy. Numerical simulations corroborate the efficacy of the proposed mechanism compared to other existing mechanisms in achieving a better trade-off between privacy and accuracy.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/nzo-uyzr-egc  ','','',1,'2024-04-10 04:12:05','Active'),(71,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Hybrid Stochastic Modelling of Daily Precipitation and Daily Streamflow','Ms. Shalini B, Roll No. CE15D041','Ph.D Scholar','Dr. R.G.

A unique feature of these ring systems is that they generally exhibit favourable structural and physicochemical properties. This characteristic made them appear to be appropriate functional group isosteres in place of other functional groups or ring systems. According to the study, replacing less desirable functional groups with azetidine and oxetane moieties can have a significant impact on PK/PD-related parameters. Introduction of a stable, small, and less lipophilic motif may lead to better fit in the receptor pockets, thereby blocking the active sites and enhancing intrinsic activity. Moreover, shielding nearby functional groups from chemical or metabolic susceptibility, without increasing lipophilicity. This study aims to explore the effect of replacing a large lipophilic substituent with a smaller, more polar group (i.e oxetane and azetidine) can improve metabolic stability and decrease the risk of adverse effects. Understanding these often drives both the lead optimisation and lead identification phases of a drug discovery program forward. In this contest virtual screening (VS) was performed on clinically approved drugs, including antineoplastic, anti-hyperglycaemic drugs, and NSAIDs, using AutoDock4 software for computer-aided drug screening. This analysis will help develop more potent drugs with better binding modes. Computational ADME prediction followed by synthesizing analogues and performing biological screening can yield promising results. Successful optimization of drug discovery programs requires identifying structural changes in leads that enhance potency. This study focuses on molecular modification as a strategy to identify new classes of lead compounds with superior pharmacotherapeutic activity, reducing the need for extensive synthetic work and increasing the likelihood of discovering more effective and safer medications.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-10 05:02:34','Active'),(75,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Static, dynamic analysis and prototype development using Aluminum 2024 alloy through additive manufacturing technology.','Mr. Saurabh Gairola, ED18D007','Ph.D. Scholar, Department of Engineering Design.

However, the additive\r\nmanufacturing of the additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy is scarce in literature due to its high\r\nsolidification cracking and low processing window. This is primarily due to the fact that the\r\ncomposition of the Al 2024 alloy is not well-suited for additive manufacturing. The high solidification\r\nrange of the Al 2024 alloy (135 K) coupled with the columnar grains formed in the additive\r\nmanufacturing due to extreme thermal gradient ( K/s) promotes solidification cracking along the grain\r\nboundaries in the additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy. The solidification cracking can be reduced\r\nby promoting the columnar to equiaxed transformation and by tailoring the composition that is better\r\nsuited for the additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy. The current study explores the Ti addition in Al\r\n2024 alloy as Ti has been conventionally used as the grain refining agent in the casting; however,\r\nstudies investigating the grain refining effect of Ti on additively manufactured Al alloy are scarce in\r\nthe literature.\r\nThe various mechanical properties such as tensile, hardness, fracture toughness, fatigue life, and\r\nfatigue crack growth behaviour were investigated for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) fabricated Ti-\r\nmodified Al 2024 alloy. The corresponding microstructural features were investigated with different\r\ncharacterisation techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron\r\nmicroscopy (TEM), electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The microstructural features such as\r\ngrain size, precipitate dislocation interaction, etc, were correlated with the mechanical properties of Ti\r\naddition in additively manufactured Al 2024 alloy. The fully equiaxed ultra-fine grained\r\nmicrostructure with an average grain size of 0.4 was observed in the alloy. The present work has\r\nshown that tensile strength, fracture toughness, and fatigue crack growth behaviour of the additively\r\nmanufactured Al 2024 alloy are comparable to the conventional wrought counterparts, and the yield\r\nstrength, hardness, and fracture toughness were better compared to the conventional wrought\r\ncounterparts.\r\nThe mechanical properties obtained were further utilised to design lightweight prototypes of\r\nstructural components of Al 2024 alloy for aerospace applications. The different lightweight\r\nmethodologies, such as topology optimization and internal lattice structure, were combined to explore\r\nthe maximum weight reduction without compromising the strength of the component.

However, recent studies indicate that launching rockets from offshore platforms offers greater advantages compared to land-based launches. Primarily, this approach accommodates the diverse orbital inclination needs of satellites more effectively [1,2]. Furthermore, launching rockets from the sea offers environmentally friendly space launch options by reducing the risk to populated areas in case of launch failures or emergencies. Any emissions and noise produced during launch operations are dispersed across the ocean, potentially lessening their impact on terrestrial ecosystems and human populations. Consequently, deep ocean space launches come with notable benefits such as easy environment clearance and reduced public scrutiny. Despite these advantages, sea launches present unique challenges, necessitating specialized launch platforms capable of withstanding the impulsive forces of rocket propulsion and the harsh marine environment. Therefore, a multi-utility offshore platform must be designed, serving not only for traditional oil production and exploration but also for launching rockets. Developing such platforms for seaborne rocket launches enhances the nationâ€™s space exploration capabilities and contributes to economic growth. Repurposing offshore platforms for rocket launches, makes it suitable for launching satellites for earth exploration, space sciences, and meteorology. Therefore, the present research chose offshore triceratops for its desirable response characteristics. The platform is set apart by a novel ball and socket joint connecting the deck with the buoyant legs, which provides translational dependency between the deck and buoyant legs while ensuring the rotational independence between them. Design principles and analysis methods that govern the dynamics of offshore structures, in general, and Triceratops, in particular, are well-established [3-5]. As the seaborne launch exerts dynamic loading on the platform, the present research focuses on evaluating the dynamic response and stability of the deep ocean triceratops during the rocket launch, through both numerical simulations and experimental analyses.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING ','oeoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-10 06:57:20','Active'),(78,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\'\'CONTEMPORARY WORK AND EMPLOYEE VOICE & SILENCE BEHAVIOR: A VR AND PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION\".','Ms. Apoorva Goel, Roll no.

TRC elements can be lighter in weight, since non-ferrous reinforcements have lower density and require minimal clear cover. The reinforcement in TRC is typically textiles woven using continuous filaments/yarns and aligned in the direction of the tensile stresses, thus reducing the fibre volume up to 50% than that of conventional fibre reinforced concrete (FRC). Normally, TRC systems have AR-glass textiles, made with zirconium glass, to ensure adequate durability in the highly alkaline cementitious system (pH varies from 12.5 to 13). However, AR-glass is expensive and necessities the development of TRC with E-glass, which is available predominantly due to its application in GFRP (glass fibre reinforced polymer). The challenges associated with the development of TRC using E-glass arise from its degradation in the highly alkaline environment of concrete. The replacement of cement with SCMs could be promising due to the reduction in pH and increased rate of carbonation (reduction in pH of the concrete to less than 10 after carbonation). However, the lack of understanding of the mechanisms and rate of degradation of E-glass textiles in concrete with different SCMs, which govern the long-term performance of such composites, is evident. Coating of E-glass is common in textiles and the degradation mechanisms would be different from those of uncoated E-glass and AR-glass, which are not readily available in literature. \r\nThe current study focuses on understanding the mechanism of degradation and the performance of coating against dissolution in simulated pore solution of pH 13 using microstructural analysis. Further, the degradation of coated E-glass subjected to different pH and temperature is quantified in terms of loss of its tensile strength. A correlation among the rate of degradation, pH and temperature is established. The existing binders for AR-glass and E-glass are further optimized for the replacement of cement with SCMs to facilitate higher carbonation rates, necessary to lower the pH at a faster rate, along with adequate strength. Finally, the long-term mechanical performance of the coated E-glass composites will be assessed with the developed binders (with and without carbonation) under accelerated and natural aging conditions. Also, an analytical model to estimate the service life of E-glass TRC composites by incorporating the effect of various factors such as temperature, pH, and relative humidity will be developed. \r\nThis seminar summarizes the existing knowledge on the glass reinforcement, binders and long-term performance of the composites under various factors and lists out the research gaps in the literature.

Due to their omnipresence and unique reactivity, the functionalization of alkenes has become a powerful method for constructing complex organic molecules.[1] In this context, direct chelation-assisted C-H olefination at the inert C-H bonds represents the most straightforward synthetic method for introducing the alkenyl group into organic compounds in a highly regio- and stereoselective manner.[2] Despite the remarkable advances in chelation-assisted C-H olefination reaction, most of the successful transformations are restricted to activated or electronically biased olefins such as acrylates, styrenes, acrylamides, vinyl sulfones, and vinyl phosphonates.[3] Literature reports on chelation-assisted C-H olefination with unactivated or electronically unbiased alkenes are limited due to poor intrinsic reactivity and regioselectivity issues. Despite these notable challenges, highly selective C-H alkenylation and alkylation reactions of unactivated alkenes with the assistance of various directing groups have been achieved in the past few years.[4] Due to novel breakthroughs in this area, there are still limited examples of selective C-H functionalization of olefins. Realizing the need for a viable synthetic transformation for selective alkenylation and alkylation, we have demonstrated the ortho-alkenylation of benzimidates and chalcones with unactivated olefins. [5a,b] Furthermore, we also developed the methodology to synthesize 1H-isoindole derivatives via ortho-olefination followed by aza-Michael addition. On the other hand, we have also demonstrated the Ru-catalyzed ortho-alkylation of benzamides with unactivated olefins.

A variational quantum classifier (VQC) using ultrasonic phased arrays is proposed to extract weld defect features, improving the classification accuracy due to simultaneous qubits. The VQC is trained using a simulation-assisted weld dataset generated using finite element (FE) models and deep convolution generative adversarial networks (DCGAN). The total focusing method (TFM) weld images of porosity and slag are generated using time-transmitted signals received by performing full matrix capture and modeling various defect morphologies using FE simulations. These datasets are then fed to train a DCGAN to generate synthetic TFM images. A feature selection method is used to obtain the best results with a quantum circuit with minimal qubits. Prominent features obtained are supplied to the encoder circuit of the VQC to convert it to a quantum domain, thereby passing to an ansatz circuit to train quantum hyperparameters. The loss is computed for every iteration by optimizing the learnable parameters of the VQC. The VQC is trained by varying quantities of datasets to improve the reliability and efficiency of the weld defect classifications. It is found that VQC, with an accuracy of 96%, outperforms some of the classical machine learning algorithms.\r\n\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkThrough Zoom Meeting Link: https://us05web.zoom.us/j/8582580759?pwd=N0VXMEtlbFNNQ','','',1,'2024-04-11 15:37:43','Active'),(87,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Bio-ionic liquids based soft and adhesive Film for therapeutic applications','Kumari Kiran (BT21D124)','PhD scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Prof. Sanjib Senapati','Department of Biotechnology','2024/04/15 14:30','2024-04-15','','BT Seminar Hall','Bio-ionic liquids, often abbreviated as Bio-ILs, are a class of ionic liquids designed specifically for use in biological or biomedical applications.

The battery serves as the energy source in an electric vehicle due to its high energy density. However, it has a limitation in terms of low power density. Battery life is reduced when exposed to high peak power demand brought on by frequent vehicle acceleration and deceleration. Therefore, the battery is integrated with a supercapacitor to fulfill the high-power requirement. A power management algorithm is needed to effectively utilize both the battery and supercapacitor. This work proposes a power management scheme based on a rule-based filtering technique. The algorithm uses the current division factor based on the instantaneous power loss minimization technique to reduce the system\'s energy loss. In addition, the algorithm uses a novel control approach, which includes a low-pass filtering approach to regulate the supercapacitor SoC. With the proposed algorithm, the improvement is seen in terms of battery power loss and energy loss compared to the existing rule-based algorithm. The algorithm\'s workings and the comparison study are validated through MATLAB/SIMULINK. The experimental studies validated the feasibility of the proposed scheme.','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/pvd-gcqs-ddb','','',1,'2024-04-12 04:54:30','Active'),(89,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','The Semiotics of Contemporary Indian Cricket','Surya Nandana','Ph.D. Research Scholar','Guide: Prof  S P Dhanavel','Humanities and Social Sciences','2024/04/16 15:00','2024-04-16','','Google meet','\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis study examines the significatory practices involved in Indian cricket â€“ in today\r\nâ€™s world of flamboyant performance, affective intensity, dynamic sociocultural identities and functions, corporeality, materiality, digitisation, commercialisation and commemoration â€“ through the lens of Barthesian semiotics.\r\n\r\nThe literature review traces the development of Indian cricket and its sociocultural implications. Cricket histories and journalistic texts by veteran scholars like Ramachandra Guha, Boria Majumdar and Mihir Bose are supported by writings on various dimensions of sport, such as spectacle, stardom and narrativity, by theoreticians like Francis W.

This study applies Barthesian semiotics to analyse cricket matches as texts of human activity (Miles et al., 2014).

Historically, the design of service disciplines focused on optimizing the average linear functions of sojourn times (rewards). Although the goal of optimizing linear rewards is well investigated, hardly any work considers optimizing nonlinear rewards, which have become crucial in many emerging delay-sensitive applications, including quantum communication, multimedia streaming, and online service platforms. \r\n\r\nIn our work, we focus primarily on identifying a single service discipline that maximizes the long-term average of nonlinear rewards. In particular, we view this problem for two arrival models - the first is a burst arrival model, wherein all jobs arrive at the server at the same instant. We show that the shortest job first (SJF) discipline maximizes the average reward for any monotonic function of the sojourn times. In the second setting, jobs arrive according to some stochastic process with i.i.d. service requirements. This setting is significantly more challenging to analyze, and identifying an optimal discipline remains elusive. We introduce a new service discipline, shortest predicted sojourn time (SPST), and provide analytical guarantees under specific settings. Numerically, we demonstrate that SPST outperforms well-known disciplines across multiple settings.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-12 09:39:59','Active'),(99,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\"Synthetic Lipids with Tunable Polarity Characteristics for Drug Delivery Applications\"','Ms. Akshaya K V (CY17D025)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Muraleedharan K M, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/17 15:00','2024-04-17','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','Drug delivery vehicles are generally formed from lipids, polymers or metal-organic frameworks, and are used to modulate the ADMET profiles of therapeutic entities. Apart from being bio-compatible, supramolecular or macromolecular matrices thus formed should not only favour high drug entrapment but also allow the release of constituents in a controlled manner. Because of rapid resistance induction on using monotherapy, use of drug combination has become inevitable in most of the disease areas. This has necessitated the development of carriers which can entrap more than one drug. This is challenging since the final concentration of individual constituents at the target site depends on multiple factors which include their stability under physiological conditions, differences in release rates etc. Previous research from our laboratory has shown the potential of oxanorbornane-based amphiphiles for drug delivery applications.1 The present work focusses on specific modifications on the head group for achieving multi-drug delivery. Considering the therapeutic relevance of low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (gasotransmitter), we have conjugated 1,2-dithiol-3-thione unit to the head group of such synthetic lipids and have used the conjugate as a vehicle for ibuprofen.2a Conjugation of 5FA (Anti-cancer agent) to the head group and use of the conjugates for co-delivery of Doxorubicin, and alteration of the polarity characteristics of the head group to modulate the uptake and toxicity profile of Doxorubicin are the other areas investigated.2b\r\nReferences:\r\n1. a) Gadde, S.

Experiments are conducted in the Weber number\r\nrange of 179 - 929; the corresponding Reynolds numbers are 5253 - 12091. The profile\r\nof the droplet interface is studied. Assuming self-similarity in the internal flow at the\r\ndroplet interface, the profiles are scaled using appropriate scales. It is observed that\r\nthe profiles of the droplet interface at different points of time collapse close to each\r\nother when plotted in this manner. This observation is experimental evidence of the\r\nself-similarity of the internal flow in this phase. Based on this fact, kinetic\r\nenergy is estimated at the early stages of droplet impact. The surface energy is also estimated by assuming axisymmetric droplet profile obtained through back-light imaging. We observe that a considerable amount of kinetic energy is lost during the early stages of droplet impact. We believe that an accurate estimation of this deficit in kinetic energy at an early stage of impact will be necessary to account for the energy-based models for droplet impact. Also due to initial kinetic energy, the droplet rapidly spreads outward upon impact until the viscous dissipation and the surface tension force slow the spreading. After a period, the droplet spreads slower while the film thinning rate becomes stagnant, resulting in a residual thickness. A measurement technique using a Chromatic Confocal Sensor is used here for the thickness measurement. This sensor allows to measure droplet thickness with high precision. Using the information on early phase energy dissipation and experimental data on spreading diameter and thickness, a model can be developed to capture the temporal evolution of droplet diameter during spreading.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/bdx-wojv-dqa','','',1,'2024-04-12 10:07:25','Active'),(101,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\"Metal-Free Synthesis of Stable Imidazolium and Pyrrolium Salts: Comprehensive Investigation of their Chemical, Photophysical, and Redox Properties\"','Mr. Prathap R (CY19D006)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Dr. Kartik Chandra Mondal, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/17 16:00','2024-04-17','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','The Ïƒ-donor stable singlet CAAC/NHC carbene has been reacted with in situ generated electron hungry aryne leading to the formation of initial carbene-aryne intermediate which further undergoes aryl group migration from N-atom of carbene to arynes leading to air-stable cyclic imine/imidazole product with C2 blocking in very good to excellent yields.

Electrochemical energy storage systems such as supercapacitor present promising solutions for meeting the rising energy demands due to their high-power density and cyclic stability.1,2 There is a continuous quest for discovering new materials that can outperform conventional electrode materials, driving significant demand for researchers to explore nanoparticles.3 In this work, copper tellurate (Cu3TeO6) has been synthesized and investigated as novel active nanomaterial for electrode fabrication for energy storage device. Among various tellurium-based compounds, Cu3TeO6 nanoparticles show promise for high-performance battery-type supercapacitor.4 Combining the high electrical conductivity and tunability of copper with structural stability of tellurium holds promise for enhancing energy storage performance.5 The colloquium will cover a brief introduction on the working principle of supercapacitor, nanomaterials and their properties relevant to diverse energy applications. In the first part, synthesis, physicochemical characterization and application of Cu3TeO6 nanoparticles for charge storage will be discussed.6 In the later part, morphological variations of Cu3TeO6 induced by surfactants during the synthesis, and their effect on the size, shape, and porous structure, and finally on their performance as supercapacitor electrodes will be presented. Surfactants functionalize the surface of nanoparticles, altering their surface chemistry and improving their compatibility with electrolyte solutions. This enhances the overall electrochemical performance of the electrode material in terms of storage and long cycling life. Further, Cu3TeO6 composite with carbon is synthesized to further enhance the storage performance and stability.

A computational framework based on the open-source CFD library OpenFOAM to study these instabilities in the context of afterburners is developed. \r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on the numerical investigation of flame dynamics and the thermo-acoustic oscillations of the bluff body combustor known as the Single Flameholder Agumentor (SFA) test rig at the Georgia Institute of Technology. These experiments used vitiated and high-velocity inlet conditions (Oxygen 15%, T=800â° C, and M=0.2-0.4) with spray-injected non-premixed mode of combustion. In these experiments, longitudinal thermo-acoustic instabilities in the range of 200-250 Hz were encountered, along with high-frequency wake flame oscillations above 1000 Hz. First comparison of modelling results with experimental data from the non-reacting conditions from the SFA is presented. Following this, results for the reacting cases with three global equivalence ratios of 0.5, 0.7, and 1 are considered. The results are analyzed to get insights into the mean temperature profiles, flame structure, pressure oscillations, fuel penetration effects, and the amplitude of the BVK oscillations. In this work, the hybrid LES model is used; this offers the advantage of not necessitating extremely fine grids by switching to RANS-based models in the near-wall regions. The Lagrangian approach is used to track droplets from the liquid spray injection into the computational domain. The simulations are carried out using the compressible Navier-Stokes solver â€œsprayFoamâ€ which also allows for the modeling of Lagrangian parcel injection. \r\nThe non-reacting results show large velocities up to 400 m/s near the flameholder trailing edge in addition to a von Karman-type vortex shedding at a Strouhal number of 0.25.  The reacting flow results show variation in the flame topology depending on the fuel injection rates.  The simulations show large amplitude pressure oscillations at 250 Hz for the highest equivalence ratio case, mirroring the experimental observations. By applying the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) technique, we confirm the excitation of the Â¾ th longitudinal of the combustor during the instability. Furthermore, the DMD of the fuel mass fraction field also confirmed the oscillations in the spray stream at the thermoacoustic frequency, indicating a thermoacoustic coupling. Also, high frequency (>1200 Hz) oscillations of the wake flame due to flame holder vortex shedding are correctly reproduced in the simulations. \r\n\r\nThus, this part of the work forms a basis for the development of a comprehensive computational framework for predicting and diagnosing thermoacoustic instabilities in the context of afterburners using OpenFOAM. Further studies can build upon these findings to optimize afterburner design and mitigate thermo-acoustic instabilities.','Varunkumar S','varuns@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-14 06:27:23','Active'),(105,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','OFFSHORE TOPSIDE WITH STEEL AND FGM STIFFENED COPED BEAM','Mr. Thennavan M,OE21D004, Ph.D Scholar','Mr. Thennavan M,OE21D004, Ph.D Scholar','Prof. Srinivasan chandrasekaran - Guide','Ocean Engineering Department','2024/04/15 14:00','2024-04-15','','Seminar Hall, Department of Ocean Engineering','Coped steel beams are the preferred option for enhancing the functionality and structural integrity of an offshore topside. Implementing coping strategies helps prevent the accumulation of multiple pipelines and cables in the workspace. The steel coped beam experiences local yielding and buckling due to the combined effects of waves, wind, impact, and accidental loads, which result in high-stress concentration. Functionally-graded materials (FGM) are viable substitutes for structural components in unique circumstances. This study addresses the development of a new material for strengthening coped beams using functionally grading Stellite-6 steel, which is a highly corrosion-resistant alloy, with carbon-manganese steel. The mechanical properties of the newly developed FGM are evaluated and compared to those of the alloying materials to demonstrate their superiority. FGM samples are produced using Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM), a cost-effective method known for its high deposition rates. Tensile test specimens conforming to ASTM E8 standards are extracted from the FGM build to evaluate its structural properties. The newly developed FGM demonstrates approximately 50% higher yield strength and 48% higher ultimate strength compared to X52 steel. The suitability of FGM for offshore applications is confirmed by its advantages in terms of carbon equivalency and weldability. The FGM-stiffened coped beams are suggested as alternative options because of their improved structural characteristics and durable character. The current study utilizes FGM (Functionally Graded Materials) to reinforce the coped beam by incorporating stiffeners. The mechanical properties of the constituent materials, Stellite-6 and Carbon Manganese steel, are improved by functionally grading them to better suit structural engineering applications. This study investigates the microstructure evaluation and mechanical properties of FGMs (Functionally Graded Materials), specifically Stellite-6 and Carbon Manganese steel, which were produced using wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). Variation in thermal gradient during layer deposition affects microstructure, improving the novel FGM\'s structural properties over its constituents. The alloy grain structure, precipitated phases, and improved mechanical properties are evaluated using SEM analysis. Experimental investigations validate a notable decrease in the rate of corrosion in the functionally graded material (FGM) as a result of the inclusion of Stellite-6. Additionally, it enhances the strength and durability, qualities that are greatly desired for coped beam stiffeners. \r\nCoped beams are often used in the fabrication of land structures; however, the existence of coped regions significantly restricts the maximum load-bearing capacity and may even lead to unfavorable failure modes. This study aims to examine the recently introduced coped beam concept in offshore construction, as well as the failure modes of coped steel and FGM Stiffened beams. The steel beams with coping and the FGM-strengthened coped beam was produced and subjected to experimental evaluation. Furthermore, a finite element model was created and verified using the experimental data. Subsequently, a parametric analysis was performed to measure the impact of different cope geometries. The steel and FGM Stiffened coped beams were analyzed and compared using the 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method. The results were compared to both numerical and experimental data, and a strong correlation was observed. The maximum load for specimen CB-600 exceeds the maximum load for specimens CB-500 and CB-300 by 22% and 50% respectively. The duration of the post-peak and instability stages in specimen CP-600 is greater than that of specimens CB-500 and CB-300. The results demonstrate that the cope has an impact on the loading carrying capacity and buckling of coped beams with varying cope geometries. The parametric analysis results indicated that the shape of the cope had a significant impact on the structural performance of the steel beams. The Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique facilitated the quantification of strain and deformation in the steel-coped beams, yielding a valuable understanding of their response to various loading conditions. The comparison between numerical and experimental results further confirmed the precision of the finite element model, emphasizing its utility in predicting the performance of coped steel and FGM beams in offshore construction. The overall study highlights the importance of using new FGM materials in offshore topside and heavy industries that require coped beams to accommodate service mains.\r\n','Ocean Engineering Department','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-15 03:41:46','Active'),(106,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','\'\'PROFITABLE MARKET MECHANISM FOR PLATFORM, BASED AGGREGATOR TAXI SERVICES\'\'','Mr. SWAMINATHAN RAMMOHAN, MS16D009','Ph.D. SCHOLAR','Prof. RAHUL R .

While the pioneering works of M. K. Geraghty and W. J. Carroll provided a fundamental understanding of this field, a multitude of studies in the past two decades have aimed to improve the profitability of taxi services. We begin with an extensive examination of contemporary literature concerning RM practices specifically applied in the taxi industry. The literature review is centered around essential aspects such as pricing mechanisms, market structure, business models, technological innovations, and marketing strategies. Through a comprehensive analysis of relevant research articles, this study aims to unveil novel trends and progressive research avenues in the domain of the taxi industry RM. Additionally, the literature review aims to identify significant gaps in existing literature, thereby paving the way for future investigations and scholarly exploration.\r\nBased on the literature review, it was evident that the selection of sales channels plays a critical role in the context of platform-based taxi services (PATS). Notably, PATS recently incorporated a variant of opaque selling known as group rides, where passengers with nearby pick-up and drop-off locations and coinciding departure times are grouped together for a single ride. Typically, PATS employ a listed price strategy for both regular and opaque channels, which limits passengers and drivers to accept or decline rides without any scope for further negotiation or engagement. To address this limitation, we propose the introduction of an alternative channel called \'Name Your Own Price\' (NYOP). This novel channel introduces a certain level of opacity regarding ride features and additional waiting time, while efficiently capturing the preferences of both passengers and drivers. The introduction of NYOP presents a valuable opportunity to accommodate passengers with lower ride valuations, who were previously excluded due to higher fixed prices. By enabling passengers to suggest their own prices, the NYOP channel facilitates the provision of rides at reduced rates, making transportation more accessible and affordable for a wider range of passengers.\r\nIn our first analytical model, we demonstrate that the increased level of opacity and additional waiting times in sales channels provided by the NYOP leads to improved passenger segmentation, resulting in higher revenue for the platform. Moreover, the NYOP channel creates additional ride opportunities for drivers, enabling them to generate extra revenue and\r\nachieve the incentive threshold set by the platform. Furthermore, our research delves into the decision-making processes of drivers when faced with the option of an NYOP channel in the presence of target-based incentives, providing valuable insights into their bidding behaviour.\r\nSubsequently, our second analytical study delves into the examination of driver behavior through the lens of PATS in the presence of market competition. If a driver has the choice of selecting a taxi ride when there are two platforms available, it is worth investigating the driver\'s switching behavior, especially in the presence of incentives. In this study, we propose a framework for optimally designing the platform policies in a duopoly market in the presence of driver incentives for completing a threshold number of rides in a given time period. Our analysis has uncovered a pattern in the decision-making of platform 1, and our findings indicate that platform 1 maximizes its utility by prioritizing the ease of sending rides to a driver when she is commencing her day, thus aligning its interests with the driver\'s goal of accumulating rides. However, as the driver approaches the target-based threshold for incentives, platform 1 diminishes its motivation to provide additional ride opportunities to the driver.\r\nOur contributions in the field of operations management play a crucial role in enhancing taxi utilization rates. Further, we provide recommendations to platforms for increasing the taxi market efficiency, especially during non-peak hours. In addition, we focus on understanding customer behavior by segmenting passengers based on their valuation, opacity quotient, and waiting times. Further, we introduce alternative pricing strategies and devise revenue maximization techniques for PATS. These contributions are aimed at optimizing the overall performance and effectiveness of the taxi industry during periods of lower demand, ultimately benefiting passengers, taxi drivers, and platforms.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION.-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadr','','',1,'2024-04-15 04:43:57','Active'),(107,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Integrative biology approach to unravel the mechanism of immunogenic response and protein assembly in  Dengue and Zika viruses','Jaya Vasavi P (BT21D402)','Ph.D. scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Dr. Sanjib Senapati (BT)','Department of Biotechnology','2024/04/17 15:30','2024-04-17','','BT Seminar Hall','Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are most prevalent mosquito-borne pathogens belonging to the Flaviviridae family. Globally, about 400 million DENV infections and nearly 40,000 deaths are reported every year. In 2015 alone, ZIKV affected over 200,000 individuals, causing Microcephaly and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. Despite their severity in transmission, no approved drugs/vaccines are available, presumably due to the structural complexity and lack of molecular-level insights of the virus particles. During viral infection, innate immune cells present degraded viral proteins via MHC proteins. T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognize these antigens presented by MHC, initiating a T-cell immune response. However, the underlying mechanism of triggered immune response during MHC-antigen-TCR interaction is unknown. Using coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we explore conformational changes in TCR that lead to T-cell immunogenicity and introduce Machine Learning strategies to extract important features. This can aid in the in-silico identification of viable viral antigens priming vaccine design. Another approach to inhibit viral infection is to rupture the virion assembly. Here, we investigate the self-assembly process of viral E proteins through accelerated MD simulations. Elucidating the atomic details of E protein dimerization could pave ways to examine various pockets for drug binding and, thus, to design drugs to inhibit DENV and ZIKV.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-15 04:56:23','Active'),(108,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Modeling failure of solids in fluid-structure interaction problems','Mr. S P Krishna Phanindra,  ED19D750','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Engineering Design','Dr. Shankar Ram C S (Chair)\r\n\r\nDr. Srikanth Vedantam  (Guide)\r\n\r\nDr.  Sandipan Bandyopadhyay,\r\n\r\nDr. R Jayaganthan\r\n\r\nDr. Sarith P Sathian, AM','Engineering Design Department','2024/04/15 16:30','2024-04-15','','Google Meet joining info Video call link: https://meet.google.com/jss-stdc-oxh','Modeling fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems is of great importance in diverse engineering areas. Traditional grid-based frameworks are used to study such problems but have been found to suffer from various difficulties, especially in problems involving large deformations of the solid and structural failure. Particle-based approaches for modeling the fluid as well as the solid are gaining prominence due to their advantages in these settings. However, most of these approaches limit themselves to linear elastic solids. In this study, we present a novel particle-based fluid-structure interaction framework based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model for fluids and a recently developed constitutively informed particle dynamics (CPD) model for solids. We present the detailed methodology for coupling these approaches to solve FSI problems. The advantage of this framework is its ability to model failure and a wide range of solid constitutive behavior, which hasn\'t been studied earlier in the literature. Using the proposed model, we study the failure of notched hyperelastic obstacles impacted by fluid flow.','EDOffice','edoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-15 05:55:03','Active'),(109,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','â€œANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF OPERATING CONDITIONS ON LITHIUM-ION BATTERY DEGRADATIONâ€','MR.

The technology has established itself as a reliable energy storage mechanism over the past decade. Nevertheless, it continues to face challenges, including safety concerns, prolonged charging duration, and a decline in capacity over time. One of the major safety concerns is the lithium plating phenomenon encountered in lithium-ion batteries. Lithium plating is the reduction of lithium ions on the surface of the negative electrode while charging a lithium-ion battery. Lithium plating reaction can eventually lead to dendrite formation and shorting of the battery. The lithium plating phenomenon has been attributed to two major factors, viz. increased charging voltage and charging at low temperatures. Charging a battery under these conditions increases the concentration of lithium ions at the anode compared to what can be intercalated into the electrode. This leads to a drop in electrochemical potential, and the ions get reduced on the surface of the electrode.\r\n\r\nTo understand the degradation of lithium-ion batteries at different temperatures, a first-principles-based electro-thermal battery model was developed. The model incorporates two different parasitic side reactions: the lithium plating reaction and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer formation reaction. These two reactions consume the lithium ions in the battery, leading to its degradation. The first principles-based model can detect changes in desired and undesired reactions at different temperatures. The model can also quantify the amount of lithium lost to the parasitic side reactions. Understanding these side reactions in the battery will help develop methodologies to mitigate its degradation while improving its safety.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','The Ph.D. RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM SEMINAR in respect of Mr. ARUN MUTHUKKUMARAN (CH19D751) will be held o','seminar15-04-2024 06:09','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar15-04-2024 06:09',1,'2024-04-15 06:09:27','Active'),(110,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','\"Spectroscopic and Kinetic investigations of Aromatic, Aliphatic Volatile Organic Compounds, and Halogen Monoxide Using State-of-the-Art Experimental Techniques and Theoretical Methods\"','Mr. Prasanna Kumar Bej (CY18D098)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Rajakumar B, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/04/18 16:00','2024-04-18','yes','CB310, Seminar Hall','The atmospheric oxidants, such as OH, Cl, NOx, or ozone, react with the relevant atmospheric substrate or transient species, forming radicals and stable products, which could potentially impact the environment by creating soot particles or aerosols. The pollutants reportedly have an impact on the human respiratory system as well as on the biotic world1.\r\nAromatic hydrocarbons like benzene, toluene, and xylene are oxidized to form resonance-stabilized radicals in the atmosphere. Among all the isomers of xylene, o-xylene is one of the most widely used isomers, which finds its usage in paints, adhesives, coating, etc. When o-xylene gets emitted into the atmosphere, it reacts with atmospheric oxidants and forms the resonance stabilized o-xylyl radical. The study involving the measurement of the absolute absorption cross-section of o-xylyl radical in the wavelength range of 460.1â€“475.1 nm using CRDS will be discussed1. The five-membered hetero-aromatic compounds like pyrrole, furan, and thiophene play a critical role in cloud formation, influencing cloud properties like albedo, lifetime and consequently affect the Earth\'s radiative balance. The experimental and theoretical temperature-dependent reaction kinetics of Cl-atom and OH-radical with methyl thiophene will be discussed as one part of the study.\r\nThe reduction of the ozone layer in the stratosphere is effectively facilitated by the emission of halogen compounds (X=F, Cl, Br, and I) from anthropogenic and artificial resources, mostly in coastal areas (2,3). The oxide substituent of these compounds, especially monoxides (XO), has a significant role in ozone depletion. Peroxy radicals, RO2 (R=H, CH3, C2H5, C3H7, etc.) are the primary consumers of halogen monoxides in the atmosphere. Therefore, one of the studies will encompass a discussion on the experimental and theoretical determination of reaction rates between propyl peroxy and iso-propyl peroxy with BrO radical, facilitated by CRDS methodology. Furthermore, a theoretical kinetic study of isoprene (known as Bio VOCs) with XO (Cl, Br, I) will be discussed to analyze the oxidation impact of isoprene.\r\nReferences:\r\n1)	Bej, P.

It oxidizes saturated fatty acyl-CoAs at the 9th position to create a double bond to synthesize monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), e.g., Palmitoleate and oleate. Two different isoforms of SCD have been identified in human tissues: SCD1 and SCD5. SCD1 is the major isoform, ubiquitously expressed, with a prevalence in adipose tissues and various organs such as the heart, brain, liver, and lungs. MUFAs act as a substrate for the synthesis of various lipids, including phospholipids (PLs), diacylglycerols (DAGs), triacylglycerols (TAGs), and cholesteryl esters (CEs), which act as a reactant for many essential components of biological membranes, as well as a cellular energy source and intracellular signaling molecules. Overexpression of SCD1 has been correlated with cancer aggressiveness and poor prognosis across tumors. SCD1 promotes the maintenance/acquisition of stem-like features, including chemoresistance and self-renewal. A strong correlation between SCD1 and tumor signaling, cellular energetics, membrane maintenance, and anti-ferroptosis activity is demonstrated by various studies in the literature. We hypothesize that developing a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) molecule against the SCD1 protein is expected to degrade SCD1 selectively in cancer cells. PROTAC is a hetero-bifunctional small molecule comprising a ligand binding to the protein of interest (POI), which is linked with another small molecule binding to E3 ligase through the spacer. Upon binding with both partners, E3 ligase is expected to facilitate ubiquitinylation on the protein of interest (POI). After ubiquitinylation, POI would undergo degradation via the 26S proteasomal pathway. Targeted protein degradation of SCD-1 in cancer cells, would be achieved by linking small molecule ligand of E3 ligase which is expressed exclusively or overexpressed in cancer cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-16 04:06:24','Active'),(118,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Mpemba effect: An anomalous relaxation phenomenon','R.

Such research provides insights into the impacts of extreme weather events on shorelines, aiding in better preparedness and coastal management strategies. This research primarily aims to develop a statistical model that forecasts the potential peak surge height near to the landfall location of cyclone along the Bay of Bengal (BoB). The peak surge height at the landfall location leads to more extensive coastal flooding and increased damage to coastal structures. However, numerical models predict storm surges but are computationally expensive for just predicting peak surge height. Machine Learning (ML) is more efficient but demands vast datasets for accuracy. To resolve this, a new approach is essentialâ€”efficient and accurate with minimal data. Introducing the Tropical Cyclone Surge Potential Index (TCSPI) utilizes readily available real-time atmospheric data and bathymetric data. A retrospective analysis of TCSPI using Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) data from 1990â€“2021, effectively captures historical events in the Bay of Bengal. This study also incorporated various regression-based Machine Learning (ML) models, rapidly predicts the potential peak surge height across the coastal BoB region using same input parameters provided to the TCSPI. Comparing observed peak surges with observation, TCSPI demonstrates relatively lower errors as compared to best performing regression-based ML model. \r\nFurther, this study aims to improve the cyclonic wind field to better forecast the surge and inundation. Many literatures emphasized cyclonic wind field since cyclonic winds play a fundamental role in predicting surges and flooding. Therefore, a more accurate depiction of these wind fields is crucial. Further, estimating ocean wave parameters in tropical areas is difficult due to the complexity of wind fields associated with tropical cyclones (TCs). Usually, parametric and global model wind fields are the two primary sources to acquire wind and pressure fields to estimate the storm surges. The parametric models usually depict a better wind field near the cyclone center. Unlike the parametric models, the wind fields from global models have better accuracy in the areas far away from the eye of the cyclone. Owing to this inconsistency, a blended wind field approach has been introduced. \r\n','Ocean Engineering Department','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-16 04:27:19','Active'),(120,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','From multi-modal data to systems-level modeling of cellular processes','Mr. Nilesh Anantha Subramanian, CS20D300','PhD.

While established models of such bioprocesses under healthy and perturbed (disease) states exist, critical gaps around double-disease states and MMÃ GRN interactions remain. Towards this end, we propose computational frameworks based on statistical models and constraint-based (linear optimization) techniques in the context of these two studies: \r\n\r\nI)  A systematic methodology using linear models to quantify disease-disease interaction (DDI) effects in immune response: Studies have shown that immune responses in a person suffering from two diseases (comorbidity) could be more complex than the union of responses to each disease occurring separately. A data-driven quantification of this complexity is lacking though. We propose a three-step computational framework based on linear models with interaction terms to analyze data from multiple groups of individuals (healthy group, single-disease patients, and double-disease group), to identify, quantify, and interpret the double-disease (DDI) markers. Application of this framework to helminth infection and diabetes revealed DDI markers like TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, and IL-2, etc., and IL-4/13 and IL-10 immune signaling pathways to be enriched in the target genes of these DDI markers. Our approach is generic and can be applied to dissect DDI mechanisms behind other comorbid conditions as well.\r\n\r\nII) Iterative surgery on a probabilistic causal network to model MMÃ GRN feedback: Integrated MM and GRN models can help predict the behavior of a complex biological system. Several works capture the information flow from GRN to MM via Boolean rules, however none model the feedback from MM to GRN. I will present an iterative algorithm that models this feedback via causal surgeries on a probabilistic GRN network and combines inference on this network with a known linear program representation of MM. I will also present preliminary results from the application of this integrated GRNÃŸÃ MM model on simulated and real-world datasets.\r\n\r\nI will conclude the talk with a perspective on how methods and insights from the above studies encourage the development of multi-omic predictive models of bioprocesses.

Despite holding 18% of the world\'s population, India possesses only 4% of the world\'s water resources. Beyond agriculture, the most water-intensive industries include the fashion and petrochemical sectors. According to the 2019 report by the World Resources Institute (WRI), Indian textile industries consume 1.6 billion litres of water daily, with the production of a single pair of jeans requiring around 2000 litres of water. Concurrently, petrochemical wastewater production amounts to 1.3 billion litres per day, with petroleum refineries typically generating approximately 1.5 times the volume of wastewater per unit of refined petroleum oil. UN-Water forecasts a 55% increase in water demand by 2050, including a 400% rise in manufacturing water demand. Without intervention, by 2040, global water scarcity may impede both quenching the world population\'s thirst and sustaining current energy solutions. NITI Aayog warns that 21 major cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, and Chennai, face severe water crises in India. Therefore, urgent action is required for sustainable development, necessitating innovative water purification technologies to treat industrial effluents for reuse and recycling. Such technologies must overcome existing limitations and tackle emerging pollutants.\r\nGas hydrate-based water purification, an innovative technology, shows significant promise due to its unique characteristics, utilizing crystalline structures formed by water and gas molecules under specific conditions to effectively remove contaminants. These hydrates demonstrate notable purification by selectively eliminating contaminants from their structure. Additionally, aerogels have the ability to adsorb contaminants such as emerging pollutants, heavy metals, organic pollutants, and dyes from water, making them valuable in industrial water purification.

The battery serves as the energy source in an electric vehicle due to its high energy density. However, it has a limitation in terms of low power density. Battery life is reduced when exposed to high peak power demand brought on by frequent vehicle acceleration and deceleration. Therefore, the battery is integrated with a supercapacitor to fulfill the high-power requirement. A power management algorithm is needed to effectively utilize both the battery and supercapacitor. This work proposes a power management scheme based on a rule-based filtering technique. The algorithm uses the current division factor based on the instantaneous power loss minimization technique to reduce the system\'s energy loss. In addition, the algorithm uses a novel control approach, which includes a low-pass filtering approach to regulate the supercapacitor SoC. With the proposed algorithm, the improvement is seen in terms of battery power loss and energy loss compared to the existing rule-based algorithm. The algorithm\'s workings and the comparison study are validated through MATLAB/SIMULINK. The experimental studies validated the feasibility of the proposed scheme.','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/pvd-gcqs-ddb','','',1,'2024-04-16 10:17:07','Active'),(128,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','System-level Investigation of Multilayered-packed Bed Thermocline Tank for CSP Plants','Mr. Jawahar V (ME11D026)','Ph.D. Research Scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITM\r\n','Guide: Prof. K.

Centralized federated learning operates with a central server coordinating model updates across nodes, while decentralized federated learning operates in a peer-to-peer manner and models are trained by distributed stochastic gradient descent (DSGD). It is known that the success of DSGD depends critically on the underlying topology specified by a mixing matrix. Another factor that affects DSGS is data heterogeneity, a term used to denote the fact that the local data distribution of the individual nodes is different from the overall population distribution. Designing the right mixing matrix which balances such data heterogeneity is key for the success of DSGD. Recently an algorithm called Sparse Topology Learning - Frank Wolfe (STL-FW) was proposed to tackle data heterogeneity. At the start of training, STL-FW computes a sparse mixing matrix by optimizing an objective which combines the spectral gap and data heterogeneity.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we address two important shortcomings of STL-FW. Firstly, the topology returned by STL-FW may not be realizable in practice due to physical constraints. We propose a novel variant called Constrained Topology Learning - Frank Wolfe (CTL-FW) to compute an optimal mixing matrix which respects the underlying topological constraints. Secondly, during training, the local models exhibit heterogeneity. However, the mixing matrix computed by STL-FW at the start may not be sufficient to mitigate model heterogeneity occurring during training. We propose a novel variant called Dynamic Constrained Topology Learning - Frank Wolfe (DCTL-FW) which uses the test accuracies of the local models to compute a new mixing matrix every round. We show that DSGD performs better when it uses mixing matrices computed by CTL-FW and DCTL-FW in comparison to random mixing matrices (of the same topology) via experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets.','Hema G, CS Office','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-16 11:16:46','Active'),(130,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','â€œSOME NOVEL FRACTAL FUNCTIONS AND FRACTAL RADIAL BASIS FUNCTIONS: APPLICATIONS AND INSIGHTS â€ ','Mr. Deependra Kumar, MA19D014','Research Scholar, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','DC Members: Dr. Satyajit Roy Dr. Shruti Dubey / Dr. K.

Various oil extraction mechanisms are used for this purpose. Our study proposes an oil extraction structure and examines how channel parameters, especially height relative to droplet size, impact droplet clustering. Smaller droplets, relative to channel dimensions, follow continuous flow dynamics, allowing for simple hydrodynamic resistive modelling to estimate their parameters. However, when droplet diameter exceeds channel height, their dynamics deviate significantly, requiring a more complex modelling approach. The integration of sedimentation and hindrance theory, along with the consideration of relative hindrance (H) of a droplet due to its proximity to neighbouring droplets, has significantly improved the prediction of droplet parameters for densely packed droplets. Finally, the developed microfluidic platform enables high-throughput (200-400 droplets per second) droplet clustering for incubating (for about 30-70 minutes) a large number of cell-encapsulated droplets (about millions) efficiently.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/qgw-waew-jqr','','',1,'2024-04-17 04:37:35','Active'),(132,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Reduced-order models to predict mesoscale mechanical behavior of polycrystalline materials','Mr. K Vineet Kumar Reddy (AM17D026)','Ph.

The fatigue properties of polycrystalline metals are dictated by the mesoscale mechanical response (stress and strain) of the material to the applied load. Full-field solutions at the mesoscale, involving constitutive equations of crystal plasticity, are computationally expensive. Therefore, this dissertation aims to develop reduced-order models to efficiently: a) represent the material microstructure; and b) predict the mesoscale mechanical response of polycrystalline material.\r\n\r\nThe standard mathematical representation of polycrystalline microstructure comprises the lattice orientation field. For computational purposes, the microstructural domains are typically discretized into sub-grain size voxels, rendering the lattice orientation field a high-dimensional representation. The first part of this thesis explored two alternative low-dimensional representations based on: 1) input parameters associated with Voronoi tessellation; and 2) principal component analysis. However, both these approaches prove inadequate for the current purpose. In view of this observation, low-rank approximation (LRA), a technique suitable for high-dimensional inputs, was investigated. Specifically, a rank-one approximation of the localization tensor was developed to predict the mesoscale strain field within the elastic constitutive framework. The voxel-level strains predicted by the rank-one approximation closely match the crystal plasticity fast Fourier transform (CPFFT) solver.\r\n\r\nMetal fatigue is associated with the accumulation of plastic strains in grains. Thus, in fatigue-related applications, it is often necessary, and sufficient, to compute stresses and strains averaged over grains. Therefore, a data-science-based reduced-order model was developed to predict the grain-averaged state of stress. Towards this, a novel statistical representation called the grain-neighborhood function was constructed, which captures the occurrence frequency of various lattice orientations in the vicinity of the crystal grain of interest. The proposed methodology agrees with results obtained using crystal plasticity simulations for polycrystalline aggregates subjected to uniaxial deformation. The last part of the thesis shows that transfer learning can adapt the above model to new textures and morphologies using a limited amount of new training data.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle link : https://meet.google.com/civ-ugnb-yov','','',1,'2024-04-17 04:54:51','Active'),(133,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','INDOOR AIR POLLUTION CHARACTERISTICS, HEALTH IMPACTS AND MITIGATION OPTIONS FOR BIOMASS EMISSIONS FROM COOKING ACTIVITIES IN RURAL HOUSEHOLD KITCHENS IN INDIA','Ms. Gopika I, Roll No: CE18D405','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. S M Shiva Nagendra - Guide, Dr. Ligy Philip - DC Member, Dr. S Mathava Kumar - DC Member, Dr. Smita Srivastava, BT - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/04/23 11:15','2024-04-23','yes','Conference Room (BSB 104)','','Mathangi G','ceoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-17 05:16:20','Active'),(134,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Flexible antennas for targeted hyperthermia treatment of cervical cancer through microwave transparent intrauterine tandem','Mr. Shabeeb Ahamed KP (BT15D050)','Ph.D. Research Scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Prof. Kavitha Arunachalam\r\nCo-Guide: Dr. Thomas Samuel Ram (CMC Vellore)\r\n','Department of Biotechnology','2024/04/18 15:00','2024-04-18','','Google Meet - https://meet.google.com/jsh-moic-pog','Locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be a socio-economic burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as India, with poor disease prognosis, and it demands affordable adjuvant treatment options. Microwave (MW) hyperthermia (HT), which involves selective heating of malignant tumour to 40-44 â„ƒ for 60 minutes has shown to improve treatment outcomes for cervical cancer when combined with radiotherapy. Commercial phased array HT device is not affordable for LMICs. This thesis presents a custom designed microwave transparent intrauterine tandem and flexible antennas for delivering intracavitary HT (IHT) at the cervix as an adjuvant therapy for high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy (BT) to improve clinical outcomes for LACC patients in LMIC. \r\nMajor challenge addressed in this research is the design and development of low-profile coaxial flexible antennas with broadband choke and water circulation ports for guidance through an intrauterine tandem with bend angle for targeted IHT delivery at the cervix. In comparison with a conventional coaxial balun, ferrite sleeve as a choke offered larger bandwidth and localized specific absorption rate (SAR) within the -15 dB bandwidth of coaxial monopole antennas, but it with an 11% lower maximum SAR than the resonant coaxial balun. Coaxial antennas with 3ï¬/8 active length and localized power deposition characteristics were realized using broadband flexible ferrite sheet as the choke. Flexible single and multi-band antennas were developed to deliver spatially varying thermal dose to address the variatons in tumor dimensions and patient anatomy. The flexible ferrite sheet is electrically small (0.46ï¬ ) compared to the resonant balun designs reported in literature and was demonstrated to effectively choke the secondary current on the coaxial MW antennas over a broad operating frquency (700-2450 MHz), where ï¬ is the effective wavelength of the medium surrounding the antenna. The broadband operation of the low profile ferrite choke was demonstrated for flexible single and multiband resonant antennas operating over 700-2450 MHz. Hyperthermia treatment delivery technique with frequency hopping and control of dwell time and delivered power was proposed to realize spatially varying localized power deposition and steady state thermal dose using multiband flexible antennas. \r\nThe fabricated prototypes of the intrauterine tandem of 8 mm diameter and 250 mm length and flexible antennas were assessed on tissue phantoms and ex-vivo bovine muscle tissues. Phantom and ex vivo tissue heating experiments demonstrated that the intrauterine tandem applicator with flexible antennas is capable of delivering localized power deposition at the target in agreement with the numerical simulations. The target volume at the cervix was 62.5 cm3 at 700 MHz and 18.3 cm3 at 2450 MHz, respectively for antennas with single resonance. For dual band antenna with resonance at 700 and 1300 MHz, tumor target volume could be varied from 28.5 to 62.4 cm3 by controlling the excitation frequency, dwell time and delivered power.  It is concluded that the antenna designs and IHT treatment delivery technique developed in this research could be used to deliver targeted IHT to the cervix. Furthermore, the proposed MW antennas and treament technique could be used to design combined intrauterine tandem applicator for delivering MW IHT and HDR BT to the cervix in sequential mode.\r\nPublications:\r\n	K.

The parasite uses differential gene expression mechanisms as strategies to adapt to different niches. Among them, parasites rely heavily on epigenetic-mediated mechanisms for controlling chromatin organization, gene regulation, morphological differentiation, and antigenic variation. The epigenome of P. falciparum is distinct from mammals as it has few transcription factors, thus tight regulation of gene expression largely depends on the nature of the chromatin structure in the parasite. Most of the research has been focused on post-translational modifications in the N-terminal tail of histones, the PTMs present within the globular domain are less well understood. How the PTMs in these domains affect chromatin-templated processes is not clear. Emerging reports have confirmed that P. falciparum chromatin harbors many modifications at unconventional residues. Thus, a detailed investigation of these PTMs would help in understanding the chromatin dynamics mediated gene expression changes in a human malaria parasite.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-17 09:07:28','Active'),(136,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','From complex algebra to cancer imaging â€“ a journey in medical physics ','Dr. Anand Kumar','Dr. Anand Kumar is a physicist and engineer with training in optical physics, spectroscopy, optical communications and biomedical imaging.

High solubility is attributed to the small distortion oxygen interstitials exert \r\non these metals [2]. Similarly higher solubility of C in FCC Fe compared to BCC Fe is \r\nattributed to a small amount of strain exerted by C on Fe. But C and N interstitials prefer to be \r\nat the tetrahedral position compared to the octahedral position in metals like Pt [3]. Although \r\nthe lattice parameter of Pt is much smaller than that of Ti, N prefers to occupy an octahedral \r\nposition in Ti while it prefers to occupy a tetrahedral position in Pt. This observation is \r\ncounterintuitive to the established notion, that distortion plays a major role in the stability of \r\ninterstitials. In this work, we explore the role of the distortion and electronic binding energy of \r\nboron, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon interstitials and their relative stability in the octahedral \r\nand tetrahedral, and substitutional sites in bulk and at the surfaces. \r\nWe show that distortion alone does not play a role in the preference of a site of solute \r\natoms. These results help us understand the limitations of the thumb rule (larger atoms will \r\noccupy a larger site, and smaller ones will occupy smaller sites) and the size of space available \r\nat various sites in Fe. While B follows the thumb rule, the genesis of O\'s occupation of the Octa \r\nsite lies in the strong bonding to Fe in the Octa environment. We showed that B does not bind \r\nstrongly to Fe, and its stability is dictated by distortion alone, which could explain the \r\npreference of B to segregate at large open volumes, like grain boundary. C, N, and O form \r\nstrong bonds with Fe and have strong environmental dependence. O bonding at the Octa site is \r\nstrong enough to overcome the largest distortion among various sites in bulk Fe and stabilize \r\nthere. We also show that solute atoms could not be assumed to be a hard-sphere with fixed \r\nvolume as suggested by calculated radii. We show that the size of the atom changes when \r\nplaced in different sites in Fe, this is due to different amount of charge transfer from Fe to \r\nsolute atoms. \r\nInterstitial formation energy of oxygen atoms at their most preferred site in TM elements \r\nbecome more positive, as one move from left to right in the periodic table. Interstial formation \r\nenergy is positive for Ni, Cu, Mo, W, Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Pt, and Au. As the volume \r\navailable at either octahedral or tetrahedral site in TM decreases as one move from left to right, \r\none would expect that more positive interstitial formation energy is due to large distortion \r\nenergy. But we found that oxygen prefers tetrahedral sites in Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ta, W, Re, Os, \r\nIr, Pt, and Au, where distortion energy is higher. This suggest that distortion energy alone does \r\nnot control preference for a site. In fact, for In, Pt, and Au electronic binding energy is positive \r\nat both octahedral and tetrahedral site, oxygen is stable at tetrahedral site because electronic \r\nbinding energy is less positive at tetrahedral site. \r\nWe find that adsorption energy of oxygen, on the surfaces is more negative than their formation \r\nenergies at most stable site in the bulk. This is due to both low distortion energy at the surface \r\nand more negative electronic binding energy at the surface. This is particularly important for \r\nelements that have positive interstials formation energy in the bulk. Adsorption energy of \r\noxygen on surface of all these elements is negative. This suggests that oxygen will adsorb on \r\nthe surface but will not from interstial in the bulk. This explains why metals like, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, \r\nNb, Ta forms oxygen solid solution while other TM do not. But catalytic metals like, Pt, Pd, \r\nCu, Ni does facilitate catalytic reactions by adsorption of oxygen on the surface but oxygen \r\ndoes not get absorbed in the bulk.\r\n[1] R.W. Cahn, P.

This is primarily because it eliminates the need for the traditional method of functional group interconversion and permits the direct functionalization of the Câ€“H bond.1 With this strategy, a lot of multistep synthesis processes may be reduced to single steps; that is, a molecule\'s specific Câ€“H bond could be targeted and functionalized, providing direct access to late-stage functionalization and the synthesis of several bioactive and natural compounds. Aside from additives and solvents at a specific temperature, this technique also requires an external oxidant, typically a metal-based one. In this context, Redox-neutral C-H functionalization has emerged as a powerful tool in organic synthesis, enabling the direct installation of diverse functional groups without the need for external oxidants or reductants.2 Among all these transition metals, the charm of using cobalt complexes for catalysis has substantially increased as a result of high performance at low cost, and its combination with the internal oxidant strategy has been found wide applications for annulation reactions in the last few years.3 In this seminar, the developments made in high-valent Cp*Co(III) catalysis using the redox-neutral strategy will be discussed.\r\n \r\nReferences: \r\n1.

This work culminates these research efforts to construct a comprehensive and robust surrogate kinetic model for various biodiesel fuels. In order to accurately reproduce the combustion characteristics of biodiesel, methyl butanoate, methyl crotonate, 3-hexene, and n-dodecane are chosen as surrogate components. These molecules have been chosen to replicate the functional groups found in biodiesel methyl esters. Each surrogate component is firstly validated thoroughly against a wide array of experimental studies. The kinetics of each component are improved through careful rate assignments derived from various theoretical investigations available in the literature. Subsequently, a surrogate mixture comprising these selected components is formulated by matching the functional groups of target fuels. This surrogate mechanism is used to validate the experimental data associated with various biodiesel fuels, their constituents, and methyl esters exhibiting similar functional groups to those present in actual biodiesel. The current kinetic model has demonstrated good agreement for various biodiesel fuels and its surrogates for a range of experimental studies. This comprehensive model can be reduced to obtain shorter models for biodiesel kinetics as required for specific applications. Apart from biodiesel, the surrogate components investigated as a part of this work are also suitable as representative molecules for transportation fuels with similar functional groups.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/jfe-nwhp-kns','','',1,'2024-04-20 04:42:20','Active'),(148,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Failure Mechanisms and Long-Term Performance Parameters of Galvanic Anodes for Reinforced Concrete Applications','Ms. Ananya S Ajayan, Roll No. CE21S001','M.S Scholar','Dr. Radhakrishna G Pillai â€“ Guide, \r\nDr. Piyush Chaunsali â€“ GTC Member,\r\nDr. Nilanjan Saha, OE â€“ GTC Member\r\nDr. Benny Raphael â€“ Chairperson & Head\r\n','Civil Engineering','2024/04/23 16:00','2024-04-23','yes','BSB 104 (Conference Room)','Corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete is an alarming durability issue at present. According to the NACE Impact Report 2016, 4.2% of Indiaâ€™s GDP is spent on corrosion and its associated material loss, repair, and maintenance. Less durable and hence, repeated repair interventions without considering the root cause of failure also contribute to this cost and the associated material wastage. Electrochemical repair intervention using galvanic anodes is a promising solution to prevent/control corrosion in reinforced concrete.\r\n\r\nGalvanic anodes consist of a zinc piece, an encapsulating mortar, and metallic tie wires attached to the zinc. The encapsulating mortar should have a high pH (>13.1) to facilitate the active corrosion of zinc and to dissolve and transport zinc corrosion products away from it. It should be highly porous, with interconnected pores that accumulate the corrosion products. But, with the duration of exposure, the pH reduces, and corrosion products precipitate and clog the pores. This reduces the performance (output current) of anodesâ€”leading to premature failure of the repair. Premature failure is often seen with the use of inferior galvanic anodes in the market. To improve the design of galvanic anodes, more literature on the crucial parameters affecting their long-term performance is required. \r\n\r\nThis presentation will discuss the time-dependent performance of galvanic anodes extracted from field structures of ages 3, 12 and 18 years, and in chloride and low-pH conditions.

However, the dominant line of academic research in developing countries adopts an external lens linking institutional policies and stakeholder pressure to firmsâ€™ sustainability performance (Jabbour et al., 2020). Research efforts that examine the leveraging of intrinsic organizational capabilities to enhance sustainability performance are still insufficiently systematized (Bezerra et al., 2020; Buzzao & Rizzi, 2021). Although India â€œmissed the manufacturing busâ€ and transitioned to a service-based economy, much of the ecological footprint and resource consumption has been attributed to the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\nBased on a comprehensive literature review that helped formulate the research objectives, a series of independent studies were built around the theoretical framework of the Dynamic Capability View (Teece et al., 1997) to explore and examine how sustainability capabilities can be developed in the context of the Indian manufacturing sector. Study 1 employs a case study-based design and TISM-MICMAC to gain insights into how sustainability capabilities emerge in young manufacturing firms (N=12). Study 2 utilizes a cross-sectional survey in listed manufacturing firms (N=242) to examine how incumbent firms rejuvenate their sustainability capabilities by aligning their extant capabilities under diverse firm conditions. Study 3 uses a Policy Delphi instrument, which captures consensus and dissent among multiple stakeholders, namely entrepreneurs, corporate leaders in manufacturing, and other ecosystem enablers (N=60), to investigate how young and incumbent firms collaborate to foster sustainability.\r\n\r\nThese studies provide a picture of how building dynamic sustainability capabilities require resource recombination and co-specialization, and they also advance the paradigm that capability building is too complex to be viewed as a direct linear flow. The findings from the research can provide strategic direction to managers embracing sustainability capabilities as part of their firm strategy. For policymakers, these studies can act as a guide to identifying the right policy and intervention mix to balance triple bottom-line objectives.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','SEMINAR - II (RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM)-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-i','','',1,'2024-04-20 11:02:04','Active'),(151,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Embedded devices to identify and assist the hearing impaired','Velmurugan S','Velmurugan S has been a project staff at the Assistive Tech Lab, in EE, for the past few years while pursuing his MS.

The operational demands of machinery frequently result in speed fluctuations, leading to spectral smearing, thereby compromising the efficiency of the analysis methodology. Furthermore, the intricacies of parameter initialisation often increase the complexity of the analysis methods. The present study introduces a fault diagnosis algorithm that requires minimal initialisation and operates independently of tacho-pulses. The algorithm proposed in the study incorporates Variational Mode Extraction with the Maxima Tracking Algorithm for Instantaneous Frequency estimation. Hankel matrix-based selective spectral fusion is proposed to mitigate the impact of frequency tracking errors caused by transient noise.

The selective activation of ortho-methyl C(sp3)ï€­H bond instead of ortho-C(sp2)ï€­H bond is highly challenging due to the facile formation of a five-membered palladacycle as compared with a six-membered palladacycle. However, under a prominent reaction condition and by using an external ligand we have developed [3+2] annulation of substituted aromatic acids with maleimides which leads to tricyclic heterocyclic molecules with good to excellent yields.3a The reaction proceeds via a dual Cï€­H bond activation where the first C(sp3)ï€­H activation takes place selectively at the benzylic position followed by a second C(sp2)ï€­H bond activation at the meta-position to afford a five-membered cyclic ring. Similarly, weakly coordinating aromatic amides, ketones and ester have been successfully utilized for this [3+2] annulation reaction.3b In recent years, direct Câˆ’H functionalization of aliphatic carboxylic acids without incorporating any exogenous directing groups has shown significant progress.4 Moreover, the usage of less reactive allyl alcohols in aliphatic Câˆ’H functionalization is very scarce. Therefore, to increase the scope and practical application of allyl alcohols in C(sp3)âˆ’H activation, we started our investigation with ï¢-C(sp3)âˆ’H containing aliphatic acids. The reaction offered five-membered Î³-lactones containing an alkyl ketone moiety at the Î³-position and an external bis-coordinated ligand is crucial for the success of this protocol.\r\nReferences: [1] Yang, Y.; Lan, J.; You, J.

High efficiency, wider fuel flexibility, modular design and environment friendly exhaust make SOFCs favourite for auxiliary and stationary electric power generation. However, their high operating temperatures pose challenges to material selection, structural integrity, and performance consistency. Lowering the operating temperatures to intermediate ranges (~600-800Â°C) may resolve many of these issues and also allow use of metallic interconnects instead of ceramics. Hence, metallic interconnects are crucial components for SOFCs at such operation temperatures. Chromium containing alloys such as stainless steels are preferred as metallic interconnects due to their ability to form a protective oxide layer at the operating temperatures. Ferritic stainless steels are of particular interest for this purpose. However, chromium poisoning of the cathode due to formation of volatile chromium species at high temperatures is a challenge. Oxide dispersion is known to improve high temperature properties of metallic alloys. \r\nIn the present work, oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic stainless steel (AISI430) was explored as metallic interconnects. The ODS alloys were fabricated by two routes. First, a novel fabrication method, named reverse friction deposition (RFD), has been developed to process rod samples of AISI430 into tubular shaped ODS alloy interconnect. 8 wt% Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (8YSZ) powder was used as dispersoid. Second, spark plasma sintering (SPS) was employed to fabricate cylindrical ODS alloys of AISI430 by powder metallurgy route.\r\nIn the next phase of the work, oxidation behaviour of these alloy interconnects was studied at 800 Â°C for 100 h. The RFD alloy tubular product showed growth of Fe and Mn oxides on one side (top surface) and (Mn,Cr) spinels on the other side (inner surface) in accordance with the variation of oxide dispersoids. Further, interaction of both type of formed alloys was studied with the standard composite cathodic layer, 50 wt.% lanthanum strontium manganate (LSM) and 50 wt.% 8YSZ at 800 Â°C for 100 h to study the effect of volatile chromium species on the cathode degradation. High valence Cr+6 ion species block the triple phase boundaries or sites for electrochemical reduction of oxygen in the porous cathodes causing performance degradation in SOFCs. The cathodic layer was found to be structurally and chemically stable in the ODS metallic interconnects. Except trace amounts in some samples, no massive migration of Cr across the cathodic layer was observed in our experiments.','MME Office','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/vst-dukn-yko','','',1,'2024-04-22 04:25:33','Active'),(159,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','NeoHebbian Synapses for Accelerating Online Training of Neuromorphic Hardware ','Mr. Shubham R Pande (EE18D704)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. Anjan Chakravorthy\r\nCo-Guide: Dr. Bhaswar Chakrabarti\r\n\r\n','Electrical Engineering','2024/05/09 14:00','2024-05-09','yes','ESB 244','We propose and experimentally validate a neoHebbian artificial synapse based on ReRAM devices to enable the hardware implementation of a scalable online E-Prop learning algorithm. \r\nThis synapse features two state variables - a neuron coupling weight and an \"eligibility trace\" for updating the weight.

Both experimental and computational simulations are utilized to examine this process. The experimental model consists of a partially filled annular tank with a centrally located rotating shaft. By varying the rotational Reynolds number (Re), the researchers examine the resulting gas entrainment and characterize the different mechanisms involved. \r\n\r\nThe findings reveal that the fluid dynamics within the annular region can be categorized into four distinct regimes, each occurring as the Reynolds number increases. In the first regime, which occurs at low Re, there is no risk of gas entrainment. Moving into the second regime, mild gas entrainment occurs because of the shearing at the free surface between two opposing vortices. The third regime shows a significant reduction in gas entrainment due to the weakening of the flow mechanism observed in the second regime. Finally, the fourth regime exhibits vortex breakdown at the rotating shaft, leading to a substantial-scale gas entrainment.\r\n \r\nVarious mitigation techniques, such as baffle plates, hydrophobic/hydrophilic surfaces, and porous plates, were investigated. The results indicate that a vertical porous plate with 50% porosity effectively eliminates gas entrainment.\r\n','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','Key Words: Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor; Pool type SFR; Cold Pool; Primary Sodium Pump; Gas Entrainmen','','',1,'2024-04-22 04:53:35','Active'),(161,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','A THEORETICAL STUDY ON THE CHANNEL CHARACTERISTICS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF AN UNDERWATER-TO-AIR OPTICAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM','Mr. BHOGESWARA RAO ANGARA','PH.D SCHOLR, ROLL NO: OE17D302','PROF.

Research has shown that providing external arm weight support increases the armâ€™s range of motion, and training with graduated weight support can help break abnormal movement patterns. Arm rehabilitation robots can be used for training with adaptive arm weight support, but they tend to be complex and bulky for use in small clinics or homes. On the other hand, simple and compact passive arm weight support devices do not measure arm movements to provide feedback and require manual adjustments of springs/rubber bands for deweighting the arm. To this end, we propose a simple, single-actuated degree-of-freedom robot â€“ MARS (Motorized Arm Support) that can provide adaptive arm deweighting and measure arm movements to provide gamified feedback for in-clinic and at-home use. This seminar presents the mechanical design of MARS, the algorithms for estimating human joint kinematics from the robotâ€™s data, and the characterization of its two control modes: a) Fixed Support and b) Arm Weight Support. A three-actuated degree-of-freedom mechatronic model of the human arm was utilized to characterize MARS. The results indicate that, \r\nthe arm angles can be estimated with high accuracy (median error < 2 degrees) without any external sensors, \r\nthe transparency of MARS (~6 N interaction force) is comparable with existing arm rehabilitation robots, \r\nMARS can maintain a constant interaction force in dynamic conditions and \r\nthe adaptive weight support from MARS adjusts automatically to compensate for the weakness in the arm. \r\nWith the completion of the design and characterization of the robot, the next step is to evaluate MARSâ€™ usability on stroke survivors with arm impairments. \r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/azr-rpvx-taf','','',1,'2024-04-22 05:30:40','Active'),(163,'seminar','Technical Talk','NULL','Semiconductor Innovations for the AI Era','Dr. Vijay Narayanan ','Dr. Narayanan received his B.Tech. in Metallurgical Engineering  from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (1995), and his M.S.

Tremendous progress has since been made in expanding AI applications as well as the accuracy of AI models, often by generating massive models that are trained on large datasets. However, this explosive growth in model size and the concomitant increase in required compute is unsustainable without significant semiconductor innovations across the hardware stack from materials and devices at the transistor level up through packaging. In this talk, materials advances needed to sustain continued CMOS scaling will be discussed including advanced transistor gate stacks, novel interconnect materials, and next-generation photoresists for high-NA photolithography. In addition, architectural progress in devices that harness the third dimension will be reviewed and will be shown to be critical to propel transistor density scaling. In looking beyond transistor performance, a novel non-von Neumann computational approach will be introduced that envisions artificial neural networks mapped to arrays of non-volatile memory (NVM) elements. These NVM elements act as artificial synapses and encode the weights of a neural network that execute analog compute operations in-memory, thereby enabling significant power performance benefits. It will also be shown that co-optimization of materials, algorithms and architecture is needed to unlock the promise of analog in-memory compute. Lastly, enhanced connectivity and scalability using a chiplet approach will be described to allow for seamless integration of disparate compute components.

Public DNS resolvers have become more popular as the need for reliable and secure DNS resolution increases, making them an attractive choice for IoT and embedded systems with limited computing power. However, public DNS resolvers also introduce vulnerabilities as they utilize shared public caches. The adversary can use these shared public caches to build covert communication channels to retrieve security-critical information.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate this concern, we introduce YODA, a covert communication channel that operates over public DNS resolvers. We show how confidential data can be exfiltrated from compromised systems and transmitted to a remote adversary. Unlike the state-of-the-art, YODA cleverly utilizes DNS queries for well-known domains, ensuring that the adversary\'s identity remains hidden, which makes it challenging to block YODA through domain name filtering.

If the transmit signals are in different frequency bands, they require a large overall bandwidth. Instead, a set of pseudo-orthogonal waveforms derived from the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences could be accommodated in the same band, enabling the efficient use of available bandwidth for better range resolution. In such a design, special care must be given to the â€˜near-farâ€™ problem, where a reflection could possibly become difficult to detect due to the presence of stronger reflections. In this talk, a scheme to detect multiple targets in such distributed radar systems will be discussed. It performs successive cancellations (SC) starting from the strong, detectable reflections in the domain of the Discrete Chirp-Fourier Transform (DCFT) after compensating for Doppler shifts, enabling the subsequent detections of weaker targets which may not be easily detectable. Numerical simulations corroborate the efficacy and usefulness of the proposed method in detecting weak target reflections.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/kis-zupy-jva  ','','',1,'2024-04-22 07:00:34','Active'),(168,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','2D Heterostructure-Based Nanofluids for Tribological Applications','Mr. Amel Krishnan (MM19D301)','IDRP Ph.D. Scholar, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, Department of Physics','Dr. M.

Also, \r\nthere is an upsurge in electric vehicles in the global market, which requires high-performance \r\nlubricants. Such low viscous lubricants are prone to boundary lubrication and require additives \r\nto improve their friction reduction and wear resistance performance. Conventionally used \r\nextreme pressure and anti-wear additives have good tribological properties at boundary \r\nlubrication regimes. However, they are not environmentally friendly due to toxicity, releasing \r\nsulfated ash, phosphorus, and sulfur. Nanomaterial-based additives offer a potential alternative \r\nto conventional boundary additives, providing excellent tribological performance while being \r\nenvironmentally sustainable. \r\n2D nanomaterials such as graphene, boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides have a \r\nlayered structure with weak interlayer bonding and strong in-plane bonding properties. Due to \r\nthese characteristics, they possess beneficial properties for tribological applications. They can \r\neasily slide between contacts, reduce surface damage, and resist chemical corrosion of sliding \r\nsurfaces when used as lubricant additives. Experimental studies show interesting observations \r\nwhere ultra-low friction is developed when sliding occurs at 2D heterojunction interfaces, i.e., \r\nthe interface formed between junctions of different 2D materials. This is termed superlubricitywith friction coefficients observed to be less than 0.01. Such heterostructure sliding can create \r\nlower friction than individual 2D homojunction sliding owing to an incommensurate stacked \r\ninterface developed from the lattice mismatch at the heterojunctions. However, preparing \r\ndispersion-stable heterostructures in low viscous lubricants remains a significant challenge. \r\nThis study aims to develop 2D heterostructure-based nanofluids for electric vehicle \r\napplications.\r\nIn this talk, we will discuss the existing studies on the 2D heterostructure-based nanofluids and \r\nthe development of a novel MoO3-hBN heterostructure as friction modifier additives in \r\nPolyalphaolefin (PAO) base oil for boundary lubrication regime. Higher friction reduction has \r\nbeen observed for the prepared MoO3-hBN additive compared to MoO3 and hBN additives in \r\nPAO oil.

Fiber lasers have unique advantages compared to other types of laser systems including efficient electrical to optical conversion, excellent beam quality due to single transverse mode of operation and the option for power scaling through master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) schemes. Beyond kiloWatt power level, an attractive option for power scaling is beam combination of multiple fiber amplifiers. Various approaches to beam combining exist, such as spectral beam combining, coherent beam combining, and polarization beam combining. Among these, coherent beam combining (CBC) holds much promise for scaling to more than 100 beams. CBC can be achieved using either filled aperture or tiled aperture configurations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are primarily focused on exploring different coherent beam combination methods and optimization of those to achieve high efficiency and better beam quality. The phase locking between lasers for CBC has been implemented with Stochastic Parallel Gradient Descent (SPGD) algorithm with the help of on-loop phase modulators. In filled aperture-based CBC, diffractive optical element (DOE)-based combining is an attractive method due to its high beam quality and efficiency advantages. We have modeled and simulated different DOEs for various configurations and demonstrated a novel phase synchronization scheme based on minimizing higher diffraction orders in a 2 x 100 W CBC system. An alternate power scaling approach is polarization beam combining (PBC), in which nearly ideal efficiency (98%) has been demonstrated. High power CBC of a  4 x 300 W system also has been demonstrated using a DOE based filled aperture configuration.  We have also investigated the effect of different beam non-uniformities on CBC efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of scalability to achieve higher power levels, tiled aperture configuration (TAC) shows wide potential due to its simplistic design with fewer optical elements. Our efforts are focused on finding novel and reliable feedback points in the system for non-central feedback, to overcome the limitations of central lobe based feedback. We have simulated different non-central feedback point/area based phase locking methods considering the symmetry of far-field speckle patterns, and one-point based side area feedback phase locking has been experimentally validated in our 7-beam hexagonal TAC system. Additionally, we have investigated the effect of transverse phase aberrations and thermally induced pointing errors on our TAC 7 system. The potential of a dual-stage nested loop modular array configuration for further scaling while maintaining efficiency has also been explored through simulations.','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/uuc-tsyr-rat','','',1,'2024-04-22 08:21:08','Active'),(171,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','A THEORETICAL STUDY ON THE CHANNEL CHARACTERISTICS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF AN UNDERWATER-TO-AIR OPTICAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM','Mr. BHOGESWARA RAO ANGARA','ROLL NO: OE17D302','GUIDE- PROF.

Also, it has become imperative to resolve conventional diesel enginesâ€™ pollutant emission and performance problems. The present research investigated the advanced diesel combustion mode of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) by retrofitting an agricultural diesel engine. The HCCI engine was effectively operated using seven biofuels: methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, diisopropyl ether, acetone, and ethyl acetate. The HCCI engine reduced carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and soot emissions by 17%, 58%, and 98%, simultaneously increasing indicated thermal efficiency by 30% maximum and 3% on average compared to the conventional diesel engine. The 3-D computational fluid dynamics simulations of HCCI combustion in the test engine were conducted to elucidate the experimental findings. The validated CFD tool was used to select the most suitable ignition improver, piston bowl shape, and compression ratio. The optimal fuel parameters for HCCI combustion control were obtained using machine learning and statistical tools. Further, a dynamic fuel blending system was developed and implemented to supply the desired fuel blends to the engine according to the load and speed demand. Overall, the research provided a sustainable, practical solution for commercializing clean-burning and high-thermal efficiency agricultural diesel engines.','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/iir-qoit-gnz','','',1,'2024-04-22 12:28:22','Active'),(176,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Mpemba effect: An anomalous relaxation phenomenon','R.

Moreover, the treatment cost is one of the major factors that prevents treatment of many of these waste streams, leading to the pollution and unavailability of the water and land resources that can be utilized for production of useful commodities.  Therefore, for the sustenance of the environment and thriving of humanity, cost-effective treatment strategies are needed. Resource recovery is one of the perspectives whose adoption in our treatment philosophy can bring down the treatment cost and would augment the available resources for further utilization. In this paradigm, waste streams are not considered waste but as a repository of rich resources that can be profitably recovered. In our lab, we have been consistently working on integrating resource recovery strategies in developing the treatment processes. We are specifically working on perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) removal from aqueous streams using naturally-derived waste material as adsorbents, resource recovery from seawater desalination plant reverse osmosis concentrate, developing electrospun nanofiber air filters using food waste, phosphorus recovery from poultry litter waste and treatment of oil field wastewater (produced water). We are observing that resource recovery strategies can offer a sustainable alternative to the existing treatment methods by providing economic benefits of waste treatment and also creating an alternative source of raw materials for manufacturing processes.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','EVENT HOST: Dr Himanshu Goyal, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Madras-web confernce link','seminar23-04-2024 07:20','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar23-04-2024 07:20',1,'2024-04-23 07:20:31','Active'),(184,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Gendering the Small Town: Globalization and Representation of Women in post-2010 Hindi cinema','Ms. Sayanty Chatterjee','PhD research scholar, HS15D026','Prof. Aysha Viswamohan (Guide), Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras','HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES','2024/05/07 17:00','2024-05-07','','Google meet [Online]  Link: meet.google.com/kho-wwpd-oxg','    This research attempts to understand the representation of female identity, aspiration and desire in selected post-2010 Hindi cinema situated in Hindi-speaking small-town India, while interrogating the larger negotiation of â€˜traditionâ€™ and â€˜modernityâ€™. The study is interested in addressing the questions of aspirational social mobility among small town women in the globalized Hindi heartland. In order to understand the exploration of female sexuality grappling with the gendered construction of a small town in the larger context of modernity and the several offshoots of globalization, the work focuses on films where  â€˜the woman question(s)â€™ are addressed against the backdrop of neoliberal times.\r\n\r\n     Drawing on the theories of Arjun Appadurai, Partha Chatterjee, Laura Mulvey and Judith Butler, the research investigates the mediated constructs of global modernity and space.

However, controlling the chemo- and regioselectivity is an important consideration for the success of this type of annulation reaction due to the presence of two Ï€-components. Realizing the need for a viable synthetic transformation for selective functionalization, we have demonstrated transition-metal-catalyzed site-selective tandem annulation of 1,6-diynes with various substituted indolines, indoles, pyridones, and amides through consecutive dual C H bond activation for the synthesis of various polycyclic molecules in a highly regioselective manner.5 Further, we explored selective C-H functionalization of sulfoxonium ylide with 1,3 diynes to synthesize highly useful substituted 3-alkynelated-1-naphthol derivatives.6 In addition, we have also reported the synthesis of biologically important 3,4-dihydroisoquinolinone via Co(III)-catalyzed annulation of substituted N-Cl benzamides with various allylic coupling partners in a redox-neutral manner.7\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

Potential strategies like carbon capture, storage, and utilization have been explored to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic CO2. The current work focuses on the thermocatalytic conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals like methanol using metal-metal oxide catalysts, which can be upgraded further to hydrocarbons using metal oxide/zeolite catalysts. Cu/ZnO/ZrO2-based catalysts are widely explored for CO2 conversion to methanol due to their high activity and stability. However, experiments in the literature show high variability in the performance of the Cu/ZnO/ZrO2-based catalysts owing to differences in the catalyst structure. Additionally, a mechanistic understanding of the performance of such multifunctional catalysts is lacking due to ambiguity regarding the actual active sites. In this context, a thermodynamically consistent microkinetic model was developed by analyzing the complex reaction network and the associated energetics using density functional theory (DFT) simulations for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol on Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3. This study focuses on unraveling the role of interfaces on Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3  catalyst by detailed mechanistic investigations using the DFT framework. This study also involves evaluating the facet-dependent activity of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst on all the catalytically relevant surfaces of ZnOx/Cu(hkl) considering low indexed facets such as (111), (110), (100), (211) of Cu. \r\nThe second part of the work focuses on the influence of metal oxides on the proximity-dependent reactivity and hydrocarbon selectivity of tandem MeOx/HZSM-5 (MeOx â€“ ZnO, ZrO2, In2O3, Cr2O3, ZnZrOx) catalyst. Experimental evidence suggests ion exchange of BAS of HZSM-5 catalyst with cationic species from the MeOx. The metal vacancy formation energy on MeOx catalysts was investigated to help deduce the likelihood of ion exchange with BAS of HZSM-5. Experiments show the reactivity and hydrocarbon distribution in such cases varies for different MeOx/ZSM-5 catalysts. Mechanistic details of the modification of methanol conversion to gasoline range hydrocarbons due to the ion exchange will be investigated on the metal-modified/HZSM-5 catalyst to understand the reactivity and hydrocarbon distribution differences. \r\nOverall, this work offers a comprehensive exploration of CO2 utilization to hydrocarbons, employing first principles DFT simulations in understanding the mechanisms and reaction behavior. This work would help in developing strategies for catalyst design for CO2 conversion to value-added chemicals towards a sustainable low-carbon future.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/pdn-qkyz-hyq','seminar24-04-2024 04:35','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar24-04-2024 04:35',1,'2024-04-24 04:35:17','Active'),(190,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','â€œEXPLORING THE CONTENT DIVERSITY OF MARKETER-GENERATED FOOD POSTS ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND USER MOTIVATIONS IN ENGAGING WITH THEM.â€','Ms. CHRISTY MARIA TS, Roll no.

Marketing of unhealthy food, particularly through social media platforms, is recognized as a significant contributor to this issue. Food brands are heavily investing in social media platforms, generating a substantial volume of marketer-generated content (MGC) to enhance consumer engagement. Thus, understanding consumer engagement and its underlying motivations is paramount to comprehending consumer behaviour. However, limited research exists regarding the motivations driving consumer engagement with marketer-generated food content, particularly across social media platforms. Additionally, only sparse studies compare content types between healthy and unhealthy food brands and their impact on consumer engagement. This study is undertaken to fulfil two objectives: firstly, to examine the content diversity and engagement patterns of MGC between healthy and unhealthy food brands across social media platforms, and secondly, to explore consumer motivations in engaging with such content. The findings of this research will contribute to both theoretical knowledge and practical insights, enabling healthy food brands and policymakers to develop effective consumer engagement strategies aimed at promoting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','--web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadras/j.php?MTID=m66d5d55e9f91','','',1,'2024-04-24 04:41:06','Active'),(191,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Association in like-charged surfactant-nanoparticle systems: Interfacial and Bulk effects',' Manaswini (ch21s004)  ',' Manaswini (ch21s004)  ','Dr. Basavaraja Madivala Gurappa (Guide)\r\n\r\nDr. Sumesh P Thampi (Co - Guide)','Department of Chemical Engineering','2024/04/24 14:00','2024-04-24','yes','Online','Surfactant-nanoparticle systems have been extensively studied both from a fundamental standpoint and due to their industrial relevance. While the interactions between charged nanoparticles and oppositely charged or non-ionic surfactants have been well understood, the association of similarly charged surfactants and nanoparticles in an aqueous solution still needs to be solved, and the understandings reported in the literature are conflicting. To address this issue, we undertake a fundamental study to investigate bulk and interfacial phenomena in binary mixtures of (i) positively charged nanoparticles and cationic surfactants, and (ii) negatively charged nanoparticles (of different sizes) and anionic surfactants. We find that the surfactant molecules adsorb on the surface of the nanoparticle despite similar charge leading to super-charging of particles and simultaneously driving more surfactant molecules to the interface, lowering the surface tension. This effect is more pronounced at low surfactant concentrations and is observed irrespective of size of nanoparticles and surfactant-particle combination. Further, we elucidate the important role of electrostatic interactions in the surfactant-particle complexation process by varying the pH of the dispersions. Contrary to changes in the properties of the dispersed species and interface, the presence of particles does not appreciably change the bulk property such as critical micellar concentration. Additionally, fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to gain insights into the nature of the dispersed species at surfactant concentrations higher than the CMC.','Chemical Engineering Office','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/fvp-rejc-wts','','',1,'2024-04-24 04:45:09','Active'),(192,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Food Sovereignty and the Changing Agrarian and Socio-Economic Life of Kondhs in Rayagada','MS.Abhinita Mohanty','Ph.D Research Scholar [HSD16D029]','Prof.Sudhir Chella Rajan, Guide','HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES','2024/04/25 16:00','2024-04-25','','Google meet [Online]https://meet.google.com/unw-scbb-xud.','This thesis uses a political ecology framework to examine the co-existence of swidden and capitalist agriculture among the Dongaria Kondhs in Rayagada District, Odisha, India. Political ecology is helpful in understanding the relationship between humans and nature, which is affected by power imbalances in resource distribution. The study explores the impact of capitalism and neoliberal markets on tribal food, ecosystems and the emergence of a novel expression of the global food sovereignty movement. The research reveals that the Dongaria Kondhs can navigate capitalism while preserving traditional practices, agroecology and food diversity. The study also analyses the relationships among different social classes, including Kondhs, Dalits, OBCs, and non-tribal classes, to interpret the complex interplay of class, caste, and tribe in the context of capitalist transitions. Ultimately, the research unveils the resilience and adaptation of tribal communities within the changing socio-economic and ecological landscape. It argues that a broader conception of what constitutes food sovereignty movements and necessary adaption to local realities are crucial to determine the long-term success of such forms of resistance. \r\n ','HSS OFFICE','hsoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/unw-scbb-xud.','','',1,'2024-04-24 05:18:07','Active'),(193,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Relative Freshness Stochastic Hybrid Systems Markov Chain (RF-SHS-MC) model for the study of Age of information','Mr. Y.

AoI  is the time elapsed since the generation of the latest successfully received update at the destination. Specifically, at time t, if the monitor received an update with time-stamp u(t), AoI is the random process âˆ†(t) = t âˆ’ u(t). AoI can be analyzed by modeling status update systems as queuing systems. AoI is helpful in many applications like safety alarms, autonomous driving,  stock market, remote health monitoring, navigation Maps, aviation etc.,.  In status-update systems featuring parallel servers between the source and destination, the received packets at the destination may arrive out of sequence. Such situations complicate the analysis of AoI using conventional methods.  In the seminar, we propose a novel method of defining the discrete states of the stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) Markov Chain by using the relative freshness of packets in a queuing system that makes the analysis of the SHS easier compared to conventional methods. The proposed Relative Freshness Stochastic Hybrid Systems Markov Chain (RF-SHS-MC) model has been verified for the M/M/1/1 , M/M/1/2 queues with FCFS queuing discipline and the dual queue status update system.\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/iuh-fmgg-qip','','',1,'2024-04-24 06:08:37','Active'),(194,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Mechanical Strength Characterization of Plant Fiber Hybrid Composite','Mr.Sharad Shukla (AE21S045)','M.S.

Numerical modelling of the extreme wave interaction with a floating body for fully non-linear cases has been done within the framework of Weakly Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH). SPH is a meshless Lagrangian method that has gained popularity for modelling free surface flows and fluid-structure interaction problems due to its ability to handle large deformations and complex geometries. Studying steep wave interaction with a floating body using WCSPH involves simulation of the complex fluid-body interactions with accuracy. In order to evaluate the accuracy and to improve the computational cost of SPH, variable mass particle distributions is employed. The SPH method is implemented using suitable numerical techniques, such as neighbour search algorithms, time integration schemes, and artificial viscosity formulations, to solve the discretized SPH equations efficiently. An appropriate boundary condition is defined to generate steep waves in the computational domain to represent its interaction with the floating body. The study of regular wave interaction with a floating body has also been done, to show that the variable mass particle distribution on the preselected free surface region models the wave evolution sufficiently well to compare with the experimental results and also to verify the accuracy and convergence of the numerical results.\r\n\r\n','Department of Ocean Engineering','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-24 10:03:01','Active'),(198,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Development of Formulation and Processes for Full Scale Inclusion of Nano-Aluminium in Industrial Grade Solid Rocket Propellants','Mr.Bedabrata Sanyal (AE14D414)','PhD Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering.','Prof. S R Chakravarthy - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/04/26 15:00','2024-04-26','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/yni-euod-oqk','','',1,'2024-04-25 04:27:28','Active'),(199,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Role of catestatin and its naturally-occurring variant Gly364Ser in regulating endothelial function','Kajal Rathod (BT22D006)','PhD scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Research supervisor: Prof. Nitish R Mahapatra','Department of Biotechnology','2024/04/29 15:30','2024-04-29','','BT Seminar Hall','The endothelium, which forms the inner lining of all the blood and lymphatic vessels, from the aorta to tiny capillaries, is the primary regulator of vascular homeostasis.

Deleterious modifications in endothelial physiology or morphology that impact the vasoprotective homeostatic function may lead to endothelial dysfunction (ED), which is associated with the emergence and progression of several cardiovascular disorders (CVDs) such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, etc. Catestatin (CST) is an endogenously derived peptide from the proteolytic cleavage of the neuroendocrine hormone - Chromogranin A (CHGA). Several studies by us and others demonstrated the cardioprotective roles of CST in various cardiometabolic disease states, whereas its naturally occurring human Gly364Ser variant exhibited a higher risk for hypertension and coronary disease in the Indian population. This study seeks to comprehensively investigate the differential impact of the wild-type and variant CST on endothelial dysfunction through a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches.

These techniques rely on understanding the optical properties of tissues, which are closely tied to their structure and cellular composition, enabling the detection of diseases like cancer. Mueller matrix polarimetry, in particular, stands out for its capability to offer detailed tissue information vital for diagnosing tissue diseases, leveraging the polarization nature of light to analyse how light\'s polarization changes after interacting with the sample.  However, fully utilizing its potential requires integrating AI to improve detection accuracy beyond manual interpretation. Achieving optimal AI performance requires a substantial dataset, which is challenging to obtain solely from real tissue samples. To overcome this hurdle, we propose refining the modelling of polarized light and tissue interaction by introducing heterogeneity into the sample model to closely replicate real tissue structure. By utilizing this approach, we aim to address the data insufficiency issue and enhance AI performance. Consequently, we propose a methodology that combines computational modelling, experimental validation, and AI algorithms for automated diagnosis, focusing on optimizing Mueller matrix polarimetry for detecting skin, endometrial, and breast cancer.

Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a widely used method to reduce the oxygen content of polyols. However, converting polyols into diols is challenging due to the formation of undesired by-products, especially with long-chain polyols. Selective diol formation requires specialized catalysts and precise reaction conditions. Cu-based metallic catalysts show promise in cleaving primary hydroxyl groups, while HDO on inverse metal oxide-on-metal catalysts like Pt-WOx and Ir-ReOx facilitates secondary C-O cleavage. In this context, our Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations predicted glycerol\'s C-O bond cleavage on BrÃ¸nsted acidic Pt-WOx catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere to proceed via a \"protonation dehydration\" mechanism. We showed that that the Pt-WOx interface ensures BrÃ¸nsted acid (BA) regeneration during HDO. Strong BA sites on Pt-WOx facilitate selective 1,3-PDO formation due to significant differences in primary and secondary C-O bond cleavage barriers. DFT simulations also predicted a similar kinetic preference for secondary C-O cleavage in erythritol, a longer chain molecule than glycerol, on Ir-ReOx and Pt-WOx catalysts, explaining the predominant formation of 1,2,4-butanetriol (1,2,4-BTO) and 1,4-BDO during erythritol HDO reaction.  Our simulations suggests that fine dispersion of WOx to trimeric units on Pt nanoparticles, preventing W doping and WOx and agglomeration to 3D WO3 on small Pt nanoparticles, are desirable for high BA strength. Such catalysts are expected to boost selective secondary C-O cleavage in polyols. Identifying thermodynamically stable WxOy clusters on the Pt surface and BA concentration on the WOx unit is crucial in catalyst design. However, the high computational costs of DFT restrict the exhaustive exploration space, limiting insights into the catalyst structure and hindering rational catalyst design. To overcome this, we developed and deploy a Machine-Learned-Force-Field (MLFF) driven approach to elucidate the complex structure of Pt-WOx catalyst. Additionally, an MLFF was used to investigate the complex reaction mechanisms involved in glycerol hydrodeoxygenation on Cu(111), allowing for the exploration of additional conformational space of the intermediates. This provided insights into the selective formation of 1,2-PDO through the glyceraldehyde-hydroxy acetone route on Cu catalyst. This study addresses existing knowledge deficits and could motivate the development of non-precious catalysts for selective polyol HDO.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/skw-khct-abnâ€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬','seminar25-04-2024 09:10','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar25-04-2024 09:10',1,'2024-04-25 09:10:16','Active'),(204,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Development of Formulation and Processes for Full Scale Inclusion of Nano-Aluminium in Industrial Grade Solid Rocket Propellants','Mr.Bedabrata Sanyal (AE14D414)','PhD Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering.','Prof. S R Chakravarthy - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/04/26 15:00','2024-04-26','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/yni-euod-oqk','','',1,'2024-04-25 10:13:52','Active'),(205,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','SiOx  based RRAMs for brain-inspired Computation','Mr. Sourodeep Roy (EE19D414) ','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. Enakshi Bhattacharya\r\nCo-Guide:  Bhaswar Chakrabarti ','Electrical Engineering','2024/05/16 15:00','2024-05-16','yes','ESB 244/Online','Resistive Random-Access Memories (RRAMs), among the emerging non-volatile memory technologies, have received interest as components in circuits designed for brain-inspired computation, offering an alternative to systems based on Von Neumann\'s architecture.

RP allele-specific strains and populations were phenotyped in different environments, and their relative fitness was compared. This study revealed the effect of RP alleles to differentially modulate phenotype in a genetic context and environment-dependent manner. To study the potential mechanism of phenotypic regulation, an analysis of cellular translation dynamics by SUnSET assay and polysome profiling was performed. The SUnSET assay showed that these RP alleles can differentially modulate efficiency in different environments. Currently, I am carrying our RNAseq in monosomal and polysomal fractions to identify the transcripts that are prefrentially translated by the RP alleles, leading to phenotypic plasticity.

Therefore, for the sustenance of the environment and thriving of humanity, cost-effective treatment strategies are needed. Resource recovery is one of the perspectives whose adoption in our treatment philosophy can bring down the treatment cost and would augment the available resources for further utilization. In this paradigm, waste streams are not considered waste but as a repository of rich resources that can be profitably recovered.

In this work, gas hydrate based Hythane storage and transportation has been studied with three different Hythane gas mixtures ranging in hydrogen concentrations from 8-30 % in methane. Further, to improve hydrate growth, the influence of specific chemical additives to promote the gas hydrate formation was investigated, including surfactants (kinetic hydrate promoters) and tetrahydrofuran (thermodynamic hydrate promoters). Separately, nanohybrids and biosurfactants were synthesized to reduce the foam generation during the use of surfactants. A thermodynamic study was performed for every system, followed by a hydrate growth kinetics study to understand mole consumption and induction time distributions for all the systems. Finally, hydrogen storage capacity in Hythane hydrate at a moderate pressure of 6 MPa and 274.15 K temperature has been reported. The highest hydrogen storage and faster kinetics of hydrate growth were observed with THF as an additive. Hythane gas hydrate pellets were made and stored at 1 MPa and 283.15 K for extended periods without any significant loss of hydrogen from the hydrate phase.

This type of functionalization faces a lot of challenges as C(sp3)âˆ’H bonds are ubiquitous in nature. The difficulty in selective activation of the ortho-methyl C(sp3)âˆ’H bond over the ortho-aromatic C(sp2)âˆ’H bond arises due to the facile formation of a five-membered palladacycle as compared with a six membered one.1 The only strategy to address this issue is directing group assisted transition-metal catalyzed benzylic C(sp3)âˆ’H bond activation, where an exogenous group or native directing group orients the transition metal catalyst towards the particular Cï€­H bond in a highly selective manner.2 In this research proposal seminar, a comprehensive survey on various directing group assisted Pd-metal catalyzed benzylic C(sp3)âˆ’H functionalization will be discussed along with future prospects of the Pd-catalyzed  benzylic C(sp3)âˆ’H alkylation and annulation with alkenes via Cï€­H activation.\r\n \r\nReferences: 1.

The pivotal breakthrough in isolating stable NHCs facilitated their comprehensive characterization, including the quantification of their diverse chemical and structural attributes. The pronounced Ïƒ-donor capability of NHCs, coupled with the facile modification of their electronic and steric characteristics, has rendered them a preferred option across various domains of metal-based chemistry.1 The key applications of NHC ligands lies in the area of homogeneous catalysis although, recently found suitable for the construction of metal assisted three-dimensional assemblies. These assemblies find potential applications in host-guest/medicinal chemistry, while the specially designed hetero-/homobimetallic catalysts with their cooperative potential can be used for orthogonal tandem catalysis.2 Recent studies suggest that unsymmetrical bis(azolium) salts serve as excellent NHC precursors for the construction of above-mentioned assemblies as well as hetero/homo-bimetallic catalysts as they can provide the selectivity as well as rigid platform required for fixing the two metals effectively.3-5 Accordingly, we have synthesized various types of unsymmetrical bis(NHC) precursors based on (benz)imidazolylidene and 1,2,4-triazolylidene donors to employ them in the formation of coinage metal assisted self-assembled structures as well as hetero/homo-bimetallic complexes. Utilizing these unsymmetrical ligands, several hetero/homo-bimetallic complexes have been synthesized involving various metals (IrIII, PdII, AuI etc.) and some of these complexes have been studied as effective catalysts in various tandem catalytic transformations as well as challenging hydrodefluorination (HDF) reactions. Moreover, these ligands have also been instrumental in the synthesis of unique multinuclear MI-polycarbene complexes (M = AgI/CuI/AuI). A comprehensive discussion of these catalytic processes and multinuclear molecular self-assembly will be presented during the seminar.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.	a) Huynh, H. V. Chem.

Designing electrocatalysts for the reduction of these small molecules is of prime importance in the renewable energy domain. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a slow reaction at the cathode side that limits the performance of fuel cells and metal-air batteries for a variety of power applications. The Pt/C is the best electrocatalyst for ORR [1-4]. Manganese oxide phases (MnO, Mn2O3 and Mn3O4) are rich in redox chemistry, which have been explored as non-noble metal oxide electrocatalysts for ORR [5]. In addition, manganese oxide-based electrocatalysts are known to decompose H2O2 intermediate disproportionately to facilitate 4-electron ORR pathway [6]. We have investigated manganous oxide/activated charcoal nanocomposites as potential materials for ORR activity and established a volcanic trend with 18 wt% MnO as the best composite.  \r\nHaber-Bosch process is an established energy intensive industrial process for converting nitrogen to ammonia [7,8]. The Nâ‰¡N bond activation on metal surfaces has been studied using surface spectroscopy techniques to understand the mechanism of ammonia synthesis [9]. Electrocatalytic N2 reduction to NH3 under ambient conditions is emerging as an alternative to HB process [10-12]. However, the low conversion rate, poor Faradaic efficiency and concurrent HER process are some of the drawbacks identified [13]. Introducing Lewis acidic sites in the electrocatalyst can cause preferential adsorption of nitrogen over H+ enhancing the yield and Faradaic efficiency of NH3 formation [14]. In our work, bimetallic iron cobalt borate and 2D molybdenum boride (MBene) electrocatalysts are designed and tested for N2 reduction to NH3 under ambient conditions. These catalysts have produced NH3 in higher yields with good Faradaic efficiencies. These results will be presented in this colloquium.  \r\nReferences:\r\n(1)	P. Justin, P.H.K. Charan, G.

Li-ion batteries (LIBs) play a crucial role in energy storage, leading to a significant increase in their usage and, consequently, a rise in scrap generation1. Considering the environmental consequences and the high cost of lithium and heavy metals found in spent LIBs, it is essential to pursue a sustainable and effective recovery process. Recently, Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES), a type of biocompatible solvents has emerged as a category of biocompatible solvents, offering promise as effective lixiviants for leaching applications. DES are low-melting mixtures composed of a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) in a particular ratio2. Herein, we investigated the use of DES composed of choline chloride (ChCl) and Î±-Keto Carboxylic Acids as a potential alternative to the conventional mineral acids for the extraction of metals from spent LIB cathode materials3. Adding water as a co-solvent enhances the extraction efficiency by reducing the viscosity of the system and promoting mass transfer. The presence of water alters the molecular environment of DES through the establishment of hydrogen bonds with its constituent elements. Molecular Dynamics (MD) has been employed to investigate the molecular environment of aqueous DES systems with varying amounts of water. Additionally, investigations into the physicochemical characteristics of aqueous DES mixtures have been conducted to forecast structural modifications within the DES. This is accomplished by scrutinizing the volumetric and excess thermodynamic properties of the DES: H2O system. \r\nReferences:\r\n1. P. Meshram, R. V. Jaiswal, Abhilash, C. Baiju and R. L.

Existing 3-10GHz UWB channel model parameters are adapted for 0.5-2GHz IEMI transmission and verified experimentally.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the experimental observations, we effectively detect ultra wideband (UWB) IEMI using multiband spectrum sensing techniques. We devise a system-level IEMI receiver to facilitate this detection. The frequency band is segmented into eight sub-bands, and a software-defined radio ADRV9009 is employed to downconvert and digitize each sub-band. A comparative study of receiving and combining the eight sub-bands simultaneously and in a time-interleaved manner is presented.\r\n\r\nThe challenge of receiving a high power wide bandwidth signal is addressed by designing a highly linear receiver front-end IC in TSMC 65nm CMOS to process the wideband simultaneously. First, a single-ended 1-28dB tunable attenuator matched to antenna 50-Ohms impedance drives an active balun with minimal gain and phase mismatch across the wide bandwidth (BW). Second, the output of balun is filtered and downconverted separately in eight sub-bands with 200MHz bandwidth. Harmonic mixing and crosstalk are minimized during the simultaneous processing of eight sub-bands. The fabricated prototype operates on a 1.2V supply, consuming 264mW power to output the down-converted sub-bands from the specified frequency range. Subsequently, these down-converted sub-bands are digitized and processed off-chip to retrieve the IEMI signal accurately.\r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/cow-mwzy-qnu','','',1,'2024-04-26 09:44:47','Active'),(221,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','\"Evolution of Computational Chemistry - Understanding Concept to Expediting Commercialization\" ','Dr.Rajappan Vetrivel, PoornaPrajna Institute of Scientific Research,Bengaluru&Sravathi AI Technology Private Limited,Bengaluru ','Dr. Rajappan Vetrivel, an Honorary Professor at Poorna Prajna Institute of Science\r\nand Technology, Bangalore, is a distinguished Computational Chemist.

Its natural frequency of vibration is higher than the peak ocean wave frequency. Generally, the response of the jacket structure platform is significantly small in comparison to other floating offshore structures. But the small response is good enough to generate significant stress at the joint level of jacket members. This is due to the rigid connection between the members at the joint level. In literature also, itâ€™s well-studied that the joint of the jacket structure is vulnerable to stress developed and shows fatigue damage. Further, a reduction in the response of jacket structure using conventional design procedures may have a huge financial burden. So, dynamic response control of such a structure to reduce the effect of fatigue damage at the joint of members is the most economical and practical approach.\r\nA tuned liquid column damper (TLCD) is used as a passive control device to control the response of the jacket structure. The control in response is achieved by tuning the TLCD at the natural frequency of the Jacket structure. This gives control only at the natural frequency of the structure. This way, the total control achieved is not good enough. Further, TLCD is converted to semi-active TLCD by changing the pressure at the column.  The pressure in TLCD column is governed by the frequency change in the displacement response of jacket structure. So, liquid sloshing frequency should match with real time displacement frequency. Further, the robustness of Semi-active TLCD is also shown based on a change in the nature of excitation. \r\n','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-26 12:21:43','Active'),(226,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Topological Data Analysis, Basics, Computation and Applications','Prof. Siddharth Pritam','Siddharth Pritam is a faculty member in the computer science group at Chennai Mathematical Institute.

Given a sequence of simplicial complexes (filtered simplicial complex) applying a homology functor yields a sequence/chain of vector spaces with linear maps between two consecutive vector spaces. We call such sequences a persistence module. A persistence module captures the evolution of the topology of the filtered simplicial complex. It is a dynamic variant of the classical homology theory. The theory of persistent homology has found many applications and has become an important tool in scientific investigation. Due to the huge size and large dimensions of data, computation of persistent homology has been a central challenge.

Also, it has become imperative to resolve conventional diesel enginesâ€™ pollutant emission and performance problems. The present research investigated the advanced diesel combustion mode of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) by retrofitting an agricultural diesel engine. The HCCI engine was effectively operated using seven biofuels: methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, diisopropyl ether, acetone, and ethyl acetate. The HCCI engine reduced carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and soot emissions by 17%, 58%, and 98%, simultaneously increasing indicated thermal efficiency by 30% maximum and 3% on average compared to the conventional diesel engine. The 3-D computational fluid dynamics simulations of HCCI combustion in the test engine were conducted to elucidate the experimental findings. The validated CFD tool was used to select the most suitable ignition improver, piston bowl shape, and compression ratio. The optimal fuel parameters for HCCI combustion control were obtained using machine learning and statistical tools. Further, a dynamic fuel blending system was developed and implemented to supply the desired fuel blends to the engine according to the load and speed demand.

Dumping the pollutant directly into water sources is a major environmental concern because Cr(VI) is carcinogenic, highly toxic, and can enter the food chain. The permissible limit of chromium in drinking water is 0.05 mg/L, beyond which, if consumed, may cause cancer, organ damage, or other life-threatening problems. Several methods are available to treat chromium-contaminated wastewater, like adsorption, chemical precipitation, ion exchange separation, membrane filtration, electrocoagulation, and electrochemical processes. Among all techniques, the electrochemical remediation of Cr(VI) has received significant attention due to ease of operation, no chemical requirement, and no residual contamination.\r\n \r\nCarbon derived from biomass is among the promising materials for electrochemical reduction, which is explored in different forms in this study. Moreover, biomass derived carbon acts as a suitable adsorbent, trapping chromium from the water matrix. A low-cost but efficient composite generated from water hyacinth biomass is explored for its contribution to the electrochemical reduction of Cr(VI). The combination of water hyacinth carbon, catalysts, and additives showed increased reduction efficacy due to simultaneous adsorption and electrochemical reduction.

Among DP steels, DP 980 grade steel is gaining wide acceptance. However, DP steels fail easily during stamping operations due to their poor stretch flangeability. Stretch flangeability of a material is the resistance to through-thickness crack propagation during edge stretching. Hole expansion testing (HET) is successfully used to predict tendency for edge cracking. There are various heat treatment methods available to improve stretch flangeability. The current research uses localized heat treatment of specimen edges on DP980 steel sheets to increase formability which prevents edge cracking during forming operations like the stamping process. Therefore, in the current study, techniques have been developed to improve the stretch flangeability of DP 980 steel by locally modifying the microstructure at the hole edge using a microplasma heat source. Standard HET specimens 90 mm x 90 mm square with a 10 mm diameter central hole were prepared A microplasma torch with a controlled heat input was used to locally heat treat the edge of the hole. This ensures local softening around the circumference of the circle. The hole expansion test (as per standard ISO 16630) was carried out to identify the stretch flangeability of DP 980 steel. It is found that at optimized heat input of microplasma power source, the hole expansion ratio is increased.','MME Office','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-29 04:08:20','Active'),(231,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL',' \"Palladium-Catalyzed Atroposelective Câ€‘H Bond Functionalization via Transient Directing Group Strategy â€','Mr. Arjun V(CY21D014)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-prof.

This encompasses asymmetric cross-coupling reactions, enzyme-catalyzed kinetic resolutions, asymmetric cycloaddition reactions, asymmetric transfer hydrogenations, and asymmetric reduction reactions.3 Nevertheless, the practicality of these strategies has been hampered by the necessity of prefunctionalized substrates, poor competence and limited stereoselectivity. Consequently, the requirement of peculiar and streamlined asymmetric catalytic approach to access valuable axially chiral biaryls is highly coveted. In recent years, due to the atom-economical features, the atroposelective Câˆ’H functionalization has surfaced as an innovative and a robust strategy for the expeditious acquisition of axially chiral biaryl scaffolds.4 However, despite the remarkable progress made for atroposelective Câˆ’H functionalization, the extra synthetic steps required to install and cleave the directing group on the molecules. To avoid the extra synthetic steps, the concept of transient directing group (TDG) has been developed. Encouraged by this new synthetic tool, the scientific community showed a real endeavor toward the design and use of chiral transient directing groups to achieve the highly challenging atroposelective Câˆ’H bond functionalization reactions.5 In this seminar, the recent developments made in palladium-catalyzed atroposelective Câˆ’H bond functionalization reactions by using directing group and TDG strategy will be discussed.

They exhibit several advantages, such as being flexible, low-weight, low-cost, semi-transparent, and so on.1 However, till 2017, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs were only 10%, which is way behind the PCEs of silicon solar cells (30%).2 In the last five years, the PCEs of OSCs have improved from 10% to ~ 20%, mainly due to the replacement of traditional fullerene acceptors with non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).3 Among the NFAs, molecules like â€˜Y6â€™ with donor (D) and acceptor (A/AÊ¹) units arranged in a configuration of A-D-AÊ¹-D-A are being widely studied due to their enhanced photovoltaic performance.4 However, to commercialize Y6-based OSCs, further improving their PCEs is needed. In this seminar, first we will discuss the existing methods in the literature for improving PCEs, such as replacing the core moiety, end groups, chalcogen atoms, and alkyl chain length of the Y6 molecule.5â€“8 Next, we will introduce a few crucial experimental parameters governing the PCE, namely, the open circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, and fill factor.9,10 We will show how some of these factors can be computed using first-principle calculations for donor-acceptor complexes. In this context, we will discuss the results of our recent work, where we studied the effects of replacing various moieties of the Y6 molecule, namely, the pyrrole units with phospholes,11 the terminal F-atoms with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like Cl, CF3, and NO2, and substituting S with Se, and computed the PCEs for each case using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) simulations. In general, we find that the modified acceptors exhibit red-shifted absorption spectra and enhanced short circuit current density. However, the open circuit voltage of the modified acceptors (computed using the well-studied PM6 as the complementary donor) is lower than the unsubstituted Y6, leading to only a nominal increase in the PCEs. Since all the experimental parameters governing the PCE cannot be computed from first-principles, we computed charge transfer (CT) rates between the donor and acceptor complexes, which can be measured experimentally. To compute the CT rates from first-principles, we employed both Marcus theory12 and real-time time-dependent density functional tight binding theory (RT-TD-DFTB),13 where the latter is a semi-empirical alternative to RT-TD-DFT, and it can be used to simulate the CT rates of mesoscale systems. Using Marcus theory, we were able to reproduce the results outlined in Ref 14.14 We are in the process of assessing the RT-TD-DFTB predicted rates with the experimental results. After establishing the validity of these methods, we would like to explore several donor-acceptor complexes.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n(1)	Colsmann, A.; RÃ¶hm, H.; Sprau, C.

Depending on the number of crossings, they are subdivided into 31, 41, 52, 61, etc. Albeit populating ~1% of known PDB structure1, their role in protein is still a riddle to solve. However, some initial studies propose that knots may provide protein with enhanced mechanical stability against cellular degradation2, while another proposes that it depends on the direction of degradation3. In the proposed research, we look deeply into the degradation of various knotted protein substrates by ATP-dependent proteases ClpXP and ClpAP. In our study, we found that the degradation of 41 knotted miRFP proceeds smoothly with ClpXP, while ClpAP fails to degrade it. Such behavior can arise due to knot jamming in the translocation chamber of the ClpAP protease chamber. Employing a single-molecule optical tweezers-based assay, we propose to look deeply into the mechanism of degradation by these ATP-dependent proteases, as it is impossible to do so from bulk degradation assays.\r\nIn addition, the folding mechanisms of knotted proteins are ambiguous. The fate of a knot in a folded protein remains unclear when folded domains hinder the free termini. Initial investigations show that folded proteins can form knots despite bulky folded proteins at their termini4. Although these studies provide the idea of the simplest 31-knotted protein folding, the folding of complex higher-order knots remains elusive. In the proposed research, we will explore the possibility of knot formation in such chimeric protein constructs employing single molecule force spectroscopy by AFM to detect the knots.\r\nReferences:\r\n1) FaÃ­sca, P.

The emergence of metamaterials has offered a new route to control material properties and a novel way of interacting waves with matter. Metamaterials constituting artificial sub-wavelength inclusions are macroscopically treated as a bulk material and can be characterized by a set of effective parameters. Tailoring these effective parameters by engineering the constituent artificial structures holds great promise for applications, including absorbers and polarization manipulation. The first part of the work consists of the realization of a broadband, bidirectional absorber. Subduing the inherent narrow bandwidth of absorbers is the prime goal in metamaterial absorber research, as this can widen the application areas. A more significant challenge is to construct a bidirectional absorber, which provides direction-insensitive absorption, as most of the existing designs exhibit single-sided absorption due to the complete metal film used in the design. The second part of the work explores a polarization sensitive transmission effect called asymmetric transmission, which is the property of a structure to allow the radiation to pass through in one direction while restricting it in the opposite direction. The third part of the work involves the realization of a bandwidth-enhanced, linear to circular polarization converter using a simple, planar structure utilizing chirality and asymmetry. This talk will explain the design aspects, mechanism and experimental results of these metamaterial devices.  \r\nPublications forming part of the thesis:\r\n1.  L. Stephen, N. Yogesh, and V.

Several methods are available to treat chromium-contaminated wastewater, like adsorption, chemical precipitation, ion exchange separation, membrane filtration, electrocoagulation, and electrochemical processes. Among all techniques, the electrochemical remediation of Cr(VI) has received significant attention due to ease of operation, no chemical requirement, and no residual contamination.\r\n \r\nCarbon derived from biomass is among the promising materials for electrochemical reduction, which is explored in different forms in this study. Moreover, biomass derived carbon acts as a suitable adsorbent, trapping chromium from the water matrix. A low-cost but efficient composite generated from water hyacinth biomass is explored for its contribution to the electrochemical reduction of Cr(VI). The combination of water hyacinth carbon, catalysts, and additives showed increased reduction efficacy due to simultaneous adsorption and electrochemical reduction. This work offers a facile method for complete Cr(VI) removal and proposes a reduction mechanism that helps in cell design for large-scale applications.\r\n ','Chemical Engineering Office','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkLink https://meet.google.com/fqb-zzus-rsv','','',1,'2024-04-29 05:26:04','Active'),(237,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','\" Time series models with additive noise with finite- and infinite- variance distributions - statistical and AI based approaches â€œ','Mr. Sayantan Banerjee, MA19D201','Research Scholar, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','DC Members: Dr. M.

However, many factors heavily impact Wi-Fi performance, such as WLAN standards, radio capabilities, bandwidth, operating band, channel quality, interference, noise, rate adaptation, hardware, infrastructure, client type, and others. Therefore, it is crucial to understand Wi-Fi performance for effective planning and management of Wi-Fi deployment. Our work aims to study Wi-Fi performance under various scenarios through in-site measurements and develop a recommendation mechanism for real-time deployment that guarantees the desired quality of service. Our primary focus is on passive in-site experiments and measurements in Indian homes to evaluate Wi-Fi parameters at low-layer levels and comprehend their impact on performance in terms of coverage, throughput, speed, and channel utilization. This work creates a new dataset for WLAN network performance recorded from more than 15 Indian homes, performing thousands of experiments with various traffic protocols and application bandwidths in a clean and static environment. The dataset allows us to understand the performance of Wi-Fi at various layers and its effect on overall performance. The dataset also enables us to predict real-time expected throughput, retries, and coverage at Indian homes.

Several types of polymer-modified clays have been developed, and the present study focuses on the use of superabsorbent polymer to modify bentonite clay by in-situ polymerization. To address the problem of polymer elution, the response surface method was employed to formulate a new optimized polymer composition for developing polymerized bentonites. The hydraulic performance of the developed polymerized bentonite was assessed by using a newly designed constant flow permeameter. Hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted using various inundating pore fluids mimicking the field scenario. A low-cost Arduino based data acquisition system was developed to log the data during the permeation experiment. Further, the durability of polymerized bentonites under cyclic wet-dry cycles was also investigated.

Ships with limited maneuverability must find safe routes that are free from collisions well ahead of time while operating between confined waters and the open sea. In tandem with this, the development of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) for large vessels to conduct commercial activities is also gaining momentum. In this article, we bring out a methodology for operating a MASS of an oil tanker class type KVLCC2 vessel by introducing a Collision Avoidance Module (CAM) in an autopilot design. The CAM is based on a cooperative Velocity and Heading Set approach in a dynamic marine environment. It is developed to perform in compliance with the COLREGs formulated by IMO for the prevention of collision at sea. It delivers the required course and speed to be maintained considering the maneuvering characteristics of the vessel for a collision-free path. The proposed method is validated by simulating it in several conventional colliding scenarios, including head-on, crossing, over-taking and close-quarter conditions for a single target ship as well as multiple target ship encounter situations. It is observed that the vessel can circumvent the target ships and converge back to its path in a closed-loop autonomous mode of operation.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-04-30 02:51:57','Active'),(247,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','A novel snubber circuit and Active gate driving  technique for SiC MOSFET','Mr. Vamshi Krishna Miryala (EE14D010) ','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr.Kamalesh Hatua ','Electrical Engineering','2024/05/15 14:00','2024-05-15','yes','Online','SiC MOSFETs have emerged as the latest technology switching devices replacing Si-IGBTs in 600V to 1.7kV voltage range. Its worth noting here that SiC MOSFETs can switch five to ten times faster than conventional Si-IGBTs. So extracting the full switching potential of SiC MOSFETs is still a challenging task. The current work proposes a simple passive snubber that enables SiC MOSFETs to switch at its full speed. It also recovers the switching losses in SiC MOSFET with the help of layout inductance present in the converter. The performance of the proposed snubber method is verified in boost converter setup at various loading conditions and its  performance is found to be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, current work also discloses an active gate driving technique to series connect multiple SiC MOSFETs. Series connection of SiC MOSFETs enables power electronic designers to provide the benefits of SiC MOSFET technology to medium voltage converter applications as well. The proposed active gate driver (AGD) is designed to reduce turn-off losses and achieve voltage balancing even in the presence of moderate gate pulse delay mismatches.  The proposed gate driving technique is verified in hardware setups that had  SiC MOSFETs connected in series.\r\n\r\n','EE Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link https://meet.google.com/zwh-pjag-vpg','','',1,'2024-04-30 04:38:57','Active'),(248,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Metamaterial based devices for microwave applications','Ms. LINCY STEPHEN, (PH13D006)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide: Dr. Subramanian V','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/04/30 16:00','2024-04-30','yes','https://meet.google.com/qvy-qpej-hyc','The human quest for understanding material properties and manipulating them for various applications dates back to ancient times. The emergence of metamaterials has offered a new route to control material properties and a novel way of interacting waves with matter. Metamaterials constituting artificial sub-wavelength inclusions are macroscopically treated as a bulk material and can be characterized by a set of effective parameters. Tailoring these effective parameters by engineering the constituent artificial structures holds great promise for applications, including absorbers and polarization manipulation. The first part of the work consists of the realization of a broadband, bidirectional absorber. Subduing the inherent narrow bandwidth of absorbers is the prime goal in metamaterial absorber research, as this can widen the application areas. A more significant challenge is to construct a bidirectional absorber, which provides direction-insensitive absorption, as most of the existing designs exhibit single-sided absorption due to the complete metal film used in the design. The second part of the work explores a polarization sensitive transmission effect called asymmetric transmission, which is the property of a structure to allow the radiation to pass through in one direction while restricting it in the opposite direction. The third part of the work involves the realization of a bandwidth-enhanced, linear to circular polarization converter using a simple, planar structure utilizing chirality and asymmetry. This talk will explain the design aspects, mechanism and experimental results of these metamaterial devices.  \r\nPublications forming part of the thesis:\r\n1.  L. Stephen, N. Yogesh, and V.

This flexibility in system design can be utilized to incorporate several custom features. Security is one such feature that plays a crucial role in the modern era of connected devices. Ever since the era of the Internet began, the number of security breaches across computers worldwide has increased enormously. Deploying countermeasures for security threats in the hardware promises to be more efficient than the software-only counterparts. This thesis begins with a survey of the security features incorporated in hardware over the last five decades. We observe that two categories of security vulnerabilities have gained recurring attention over the years. They are, what we term as Memory vulnerabilities and Micro-architecture based vulnerabilities. Around 47% of the total works surveyed deal with Memory vulnerabilities, while around 25% of them deal with Micro-architecture based vulnerabilities. Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), a forum that ranks security threats, ranks Memory Vulnerability and Micro-Architecture based vulnerabilities among the top ten software and hardware weaknesses respectively. In this thesis, we present countermeasures for attacks from each of the two categories. We propose a framework to analyze micro-architecture based vulnerabilities over branch predictors and establish a tuneable scheme of defense to satisfy the orthogonal constraints of security and performance. In the later part of the thesis, we present solutions that thwart memory vulnerabilities that arise out of unsafe coding practices in languages such as C and C++. Our comprehensive solution for memory vulnerabilities exhibits very low performance and area overheads. All our solutions are implemented on open-source processors and verified on FPGA platforms.','CS Office','csoffice@cse.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/sij-jpdv-rex','','',1,'2024-04-30 11:28:04','Active'),(253,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','\"Computational Advancement towards Efficient Catalytic Materials: Connecting a Few Dots\"','Dr. Sudip Chakraborty, Reader F, Materials Theory for Energy Scavenging (MATES) Lab, Harish-Chandra Research Institute (HRI) Allahabad, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), India','Dr. Sudip Chakraborty is leading Materials Theory for Energy Scavenging (MATES Lab)\r\ngroup(http://www.hri.res.in/~sudipchakraborty/) in Indiaâ€™s premier theoretical research Institute Harish-\r\nChandra Research Institute (HRI) Allahabad (Prayagraj), Department of Atomic Energy, Govt. of India.\r\nAfter completing his Ph.D. in collaboration between Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and\r\nUniversity of Pune, India, he moved to Max Planck Institute, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany in March, 2011 as a Max\r\nPlanck Postdoctoral Fellow.

Bacteria form swarm and biofilm colonies on hydrated surfaces. These processes are significantly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, pH, nutrient availability, substratum properties, and the physiological state of the bacteria. \r\nIn this study, we develop a comprehensive two-phase model to analyze the dynamics of bacterial swarming on porous substrates. The two distinct phases under consideration are the cell and aqueous phases. We use the thin-film approximation, as the characteristic height of the swarm is significantly lower than its characteristic radius. Our model incorporates surfactant generation by microorganisms, drag forces between the cell and aqueous phases, osmotic influx, and Marangoni stresses. The disjoining pressure is included to account for substrate wettability, and a precursor film is employed to address the contact line singularity. Several morphologies of bacterial swarms, such as arrested, circular, modulated, branching, droplet, fingering, and dendrite, have been observed experimentally. The model developed is capable of predicting all these shapes. An increase in the wettability of the substrate leads to faster expansion, while increased surface tension helps redistribute biomass radially. The role of biomass growth and surfactant production rate, surfactant diffusivity, and osmotic influx on the morphology of bacterial swarm colonies are explored. \r\nAdditionally, we investigate the growth kinetics of bacterial biofilms on porous substrates. A three-phase model is developed, which accounts explicitly for the cell phase, extracellular matrix (ECM), and nutrient-rich aqueous phase. Here, again, we use the thin-film approximation. We use the 2D axisymmetric model to capture biofilm growth on a porous agar substrate. Our model accounts for osmotic flux and predicts the spatiotemporal variations of the volume fractions of the different phases and the nutrient concentrations in the biofilm and the substrate. An increase in surface tension helps redistribute biomass radially. Our model captures the behavior of different kinds of biofilms: films characterized by low (yeast) and high (bacterial) ECM content. The predictions of our model are quantitatively validated with the experimental data from the literature. Our model provides insights into the role of different parameters on biofilm growth, which can be used to develop strategies to prevent or accelerate biofilm formation on surfaces.','NATTAR MUTHU, SUPERINTENDENT','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/zjv-hooi-ztaâ€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬â€¬','seminar01-05-2024 03:19','10.24.8.213/seminar/upload/seminar01-05-2024 03:19',1,'2024-05-01 03:19:57','Active'),(255,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Efficient Representation, Coding and Streaming of Light field Videos for Glasses-free 3D Displays ','Ms. Joshitha R (EE19D701)','Ph.D Scholar, Department of Electrical Engineering','Guide: Dr. Mansi Sharma\r\nCo-Guide: Dr. Kaushik Mitra ','Electrical Engineering','2024/05/07 10:00','2024-05-07','yes','ESB 244/Online','Applications of light fields for autostereoscopic or glasses-free displays have gained interest in the research community off-late since computational multi-view light field displays can enhance the viewing experience by providing a more immersive and realistic view. A richer 3D representation of a moving environment can be obtained from a dynamic light field or light field videos. However, unlike conventional videos, working with dynamic light fields necessitates additional storage and transmission requirements, and entails longer processing times. This results in higher data rates across all devices and services utilized for light field exchange and display. Thus, efficient representation and coding of light field videos capitalizing on the inherent redundancies in the spatial, angular, and temporal domains is necessary for streaming and display applications.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I shall discuss data-driven algorithms that efficiently represent and encode dynamic light field data. An integrated deep learning network that synchronously applies aperture coding and pixel-wise exposure coding on light field video to produce a single acquired image within a single exposure time, will be presented. The underlying spatial, angular, and temporal correlations are effectively exploited by a data-driven dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) based approach on these learnt acquired images arranged as time snapshots. In addition, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) removes intra-frame, inter-frame, and other intrinsic redundancies while maintaining reconstruction quality across various quantization parameters. Thus, the proposed scheme treats dynamic light fields as mathematical dynamical systems and  leverages on dynamic modes of acquired images obtained via coded-aperture patterns. I will also present a comparison of the scheme with other data-driven methods (involving (a) block singular value decomposition in a Krylov subspace and (b) Tucker decomposition with tensor sketching) to encode light fields.\r\n\r\nOverall, the algorithms exploit intra-view, inter-view, and other redundancies among light field views in spatial, angular and temporal directions to allow scalable light field video coding. The schemes provide flexible encoding of the input dynamic light field to satisfy diverse data rates for various approximation ranks and quantization parameters. Compression rates can be tailored to meet specific storage needs or bandwidths without compromising the quality of reconstructed light field video. The proposed scheme can be incorporated as a complement to other existing or future light field coding or video processing methods. The coding approaches are also applicable for light field streaming applications in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), or 3D platforms.

Therefore, restoring the structural integrity of the components is critically imperative. Repairing the damaged component is the most feasible solution compared to replacement when the damage is not extensive. This work presents a detailed investigation of patch repair on Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) laminate composites and enhancement in impact strength of post-repaired laminates by utilizing various stacking sequences of patch and parent laminates. Additionally, this study also provides a comprehensive investigation of the damage behaviour of laminate under impact loading with the aid of the Acoustic Emission (AE) technique. Four different combinations of patch-repaired laminates were considered, with two distinct configurations of patch and parent laminates each, and subjected to quasi-static indentation loading. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the repair method, with all repaired laminates showcasing superior impact resistance compared to their pristine counterparts. Patch laminates consisting of both 45Â° and 0Â° plies were observed to withstand a higher impact load, whereas patches with all plies at 45Â° exhibited the most gradual decrease in load over time. Moreover, a parametric study was also performed to determine the optimum size of the patch by utilizing the finite element numerical technique in ABAQUS software.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline Meeting Link : https://meet.google.com/pme-vick-kvj','','',1,'2024-05-01 11:03:40','Active'),(258,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Diffusion and search in complex media - examples from biology','Mithun Kumar Mitra','Department of Physics','IIT Bombay','Center for Soft and Biological Matter (CSBM)','2024/05/14 15:00','2024-05-14','','HSB 209, IITMadras','Transport and search processes are often crucial in biological systems.

We will consider experimental data to situate our theoretical results in the context of the protein search problem.

This plasticity helps the organisms adapt to various conditions, allowing them to thrive and reproduce. Over time, individuals with advantageous traits are favoured by natural selection, leading to the development of more robust phenotypes. Knowing how genetics and physiology drive adaptation in different environments is crucial. \r\nAnalysis of yeast ribosomal protein (RP) sequences shows that despite being highly conserved, they have non-synonymous variants in multiple genes and strains, indicating that these variants may play a role in adaptation. Previous results from our laboratory found that the variants of the RP gene, RPL8A, can modulate phenotypic plasticity in a genetic and environment-specific manner. These results lead us to hypothesise that these variants in their genetic context could confer a fitness advantage in their adapted environment. Therefore, to explore the adaptive potential of RP variants, I will select two non-synonymous variants of RPL8A and create two pairs of strains such that the variant is either in a native or an alternative genetic background. These pairs of isogenic strains with alternative alleles will be evolved in single constant and alternating environments, such as rich growth conditions followed by stress conditions (genotoxic stress and antifungal drugs) and back to rich conditions and so on. The constant environment will allow us to understand the consequence of adaptation between the two strains in a pair. The fluctuating environment will reveal how dynamically changing environments can change the rate of evolution and adaptation when the variant is in a native or alternative background. Comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of the evolved strains will reveal the molecular mechanisms behind the variant-specific adaptation in particular environmental conditions. Studying the impact of RP variation can contribute to understanding how RP genes can play a crucial role in adaptation to different environmental conditions, including drug resistance. \r\n\r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-02 03:36:31','Active'),(260,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Structural and functional characterisation of apelin receptor system','M.

Apelin receptor (APJR) is a class-A GPCR that regulates a wide range of intracellular signalling cascades. In response to its endogenous peptide ligands, apelin and elabela, APJR modulates blood pressure, cardiac output, and fluid homeostasis. The apelin ligand system itself exhibits versatility, with isoforms like apelin-13, -17, and -36 potentially eliciting distinct cellular responses. In class-A GPCRs, conserved motifs mediate conformational changes of the active states of the receptor, and signal transduction is achieved by selectively binding to GÎ± proteins and/or adapter protein, arrestin. However, a significant knowledge gap persists regarding how these conserved motifs within APJR govern receptor activation and dictate signaling specificity.  Investigating the role of these conserved motifs in APJR can provide us with a better understanding of the structural basis of receptor activation and G-protein coupling to transduce signals into the cells. Furthermore, while the presence of APJR and its ligands (apelin and elabela) is well-established across various vertebrates, a comprehensive understanding of how their structures and binding interactions diverge across species remains elusive. Addressing this knowledge gap would not only enhance our understanding of APJR signaling but also provide valuable insights into potential species-specific functionalities.\r\nThe functional roles of the DRY and NPxxY motifs within APJR were explored by analyzing their effects on downstream signaling pathways across the receptor\'s conformational landscape. Our findings demonstrate that mutations within these motifs lock the receptor in distinct conformations. Specifically, altering the DRY motif disrupts G-protein coupling, while mutations in the NPxxY motif abolish Î²-arrestin-2 recruitment. These observations illuminate the critical roles of these motifs in APJR activation and their potential for achieving functional selectivity. We propose that DRY and NPxxY motifs function as conformational switches, dictating APJR signaling outcomes. Additionally, the evolutionary relationship between apelin peptides and their binding mode to APJR was also explored. We focused on potential variations in ligand binding across different species, comparing lower organisms to humans.\r\n\r\n','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-02 03:49:35','Active'),(261,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Studies of the dynamics of some soft matter systems using optical tweezers','Mr. AMRENDRA KUMAR, (PH18D055)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide: Dr. Basudev Roy','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/05/06 15:00','2024-05-06','yes','https://meet.google.com/xdo-kvrf-nci','Optical tweezers are versatile tools that use a highly tightly focused laser beam to trap, hold, and manipulate small particles without physical contact.

These flows are typically modeled as partial differential equations (PDEs), which are solved numerically using PDE solvers. In general, these simulations are extremely computationally expensive and are performed on massively parallel supercomputers. However, at extreme scales, the scalability of a PDE solver is significantly affected by the communication overhead. This work proposes an asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin (ADG) method that relaxes communication at a mathematical level and has the potential to provide high-order accurate solutions for various flow problems on both structured and unstructured meshes. We first propose a new approach to couple asynchrony-tolerant schemes with low-storage explicit RK schemes with reduced communication efforts. We evaluate the accuracy of this method both theoretically and numerically and demonstrate its scalability through simulations of decaying turbulence. Subsequently, we introduce the asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin (ADG) method, which combines the benefits of the DG method with asynchronous computing. We investigate the numerical properties of the proposed method, including local conservation, stability, and accuracy, and show that it is at most first-order accurate. To recover accuracy, we develop new asynchrony-tolerant (AT) fluxes that utilize data from multiple time levels. Several numerical experiments are conducted based on linear and nonlinear problems to validate these theoretical findings. Finally, a parallel PDE solver based on the ADG method is developed within an open-source finite element library deal.II, using a communication-avoiding algorithm. The accuracy of the solver is validated for compressible Euler equations, and scalability benchmarks demonstrate a speedup of up to 80% with the ADG method at an extreme scale with 9216 cores.','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-02 05:07:54','Active'),(263,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','A coupled fluid-flow and geomechanics modelling to access the advantage of CO2 as the working fluid and impact of fracture aperture alteration on energy production of EGS','Mr. Shradharghya Shankar Adhikary (AM20S023) ','Guide: Dr. M Manivannan','M S research scholar, Dept. of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering, IIT Madras','Department of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering','2024/05/07 15:00','2024-05-07','yes','Online Meeting Link: https://meet.google.com/ziy-dkza-vsa','Geothermal reservoirs are often fractured rock medium.

A three-dimensional model of fractured enhanced geothermal system is developed to simulate the coupled multiphase flow, heat transfer, and thermo-poro-elastic deformation. Randomly oriented rectangular fractures with different sizes and dip angles are created using ADFNE Matlab code. FEHM code and a structural computational mesh are employed for multiphase flow, heat transfer, and stress dependent simulations of the reservoir. The energy extraction using supercritical CO2 as the working fluid is advantageous due to high mobility and high thermal expansivity. The density difference between brine and CO2 is higher for higher temperatures and lower pressure. In the present study we first investigate the energy production rate in moderate to high enthalpy reservoirs using both water and CO2 as working fluids, considering factors such as different reservoir temperature and injection pressure, fracture network connectivity and rock matrix permeability to compare the energy production rate. In the second part of this study, the influence of thermo-poro-elastic stresses on fracture aperture, permeability, and geothermal energy extraction is investigated. The study incorporates the correlation between fracture permeability variation and local stress tensor changes. The nodes belonging to the fractures are assigned appropriate permeability and mechanical properties depending on the fracture aperture. The values of these properties are subjected to alteration based on local stress values.

However, the conventional mode of refrigerated preservation of DNA has detrimental effects to its stability and remain a cost ineffective way of preservation. Ionic liquids (ILs), comprised of organic cations and organic/inorganic anions are promising solvent media for preservation of biomolecules. In this work, we attempt to understand the role of different classes of ILs: aprotic and protic in stabilizing DNA through a series of biophysical experiments. Our experimental findings suggested that protic ILs significantly elevate the DNA melting temperature, while the native B-conformation of DNA remains unaltered in all ILs. Further, we employed MD simulations and quantum calculations to understand the mechanism of interaction of ILs with DNA which revealed that protic ILs bring about a stronger H-bonding network through its ability of making multiple intermolecular H-bonds with the nucleobases and among the IL ions. Subsequently, we evaluated the structural integrity of plasmid DNA (pDNA) in the presence of ILs, while subjecting it to diverse stress conditions to ascertain its enhanced stability. Furthermore, we conducted bacterial transformation and transfection studies using pDNA in ILs to assess the functional activity. The results indicated that ILs confer protection to pDNA in ILs.','BT Office','btoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttp://meet.google.com/num-ebta-hvk','','',1,'2024-05-02 09:11:07','Active'),(272,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Development of Formulation and Processes for Full Scale Inclusion of Nano-Aluminium in Industrial Grade Solid Rocket Propellants','Mr.Bedabrata Sanyal (AE14D414)','Phd Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engg.','Prof.Chakravarthy S R - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/05/03 15:00','2024-05-03','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/scm-pzzy-nza','','',1,'2024-05-02 10:50:11','Active'),(273,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','â€œDesign and Synthesis of Aggregation Induced Emissive Gels and Application towards Fluorescence Sensing of Volatile Acids and Biologically Important Ionsâ€   ','Mr. Srikanta Kumar Patra (CY15D095)','Ph.D Research Scholar, Department of Chemistry','Guide-Prof. Edamana Prasad, Department of Chemistry','Department of Chemistry','2024/05/08 11:00','2024-05-08','yes','CB-310','There is an increasing interest in developing analytical methods for the detection of environmentally and biologically important chemical species as they have vital roles in many physiological and biochemical processes in both plants and animals, regulating their growth, developments and vital metabolic activities. However, they become toxic at high concentrations and their deficiency also creates health problem in living species. Compared to methods like inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), electrochemical methods and atomic spectroscopy, colorimetric and fluorometric methods have attracted wide attention because of their high selectivity, high responsiveness, low detection limits and onsite monitoring. Low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs) upon aggregation can result in enhanced fluorescence signals, which is termed as aggregation induced emission (AIE) and this phenomenon can be used to design fluorescent self-assembled systems such as gels for the detection of biologically important analytes.\r\nIn the present study, poly(aryl ether) dendron based molecular systems were designed and synthesized which contain different fluorophore core units (acridine, indole and tetraphenyl ethylene), through an aldimine coupling reaction.  The poly(aryl ether) dendron derivatives self-assemble and form gels, exhibiting AIE behavior, and they have been used for sensing Fe3+, Al3+, Cu2+, iodide and volatile organic acids for real-time monitoring.1-4 The gelator molecules were characterized using NMR, HRMS, XRD, HR-SEM and rheology techniques. Typically, the gel formation was carried out in DMF/water mixture (1:1, v/v) and the AIE property of gels were investigated using steady-state absorption and emission spectroscopic techniques. The sensory response of the gelator was tested with a wide range of acids, amines, cations and anions, both in solution as well as solid films. The results indicated that the acridine cored poly(aryl ether) dendron (APD) exhibited selective response towards acid vapours through fluorescence quenching and the detection limits (DL) of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and nitric acid (HNO3) vapors were found to be as low as 0.22, 0.90 and 0.30 ppm, respectively. Interestingly, the indole cored poly(aryl ether) dendron (IPD) and tetraphenyl ethynyl cored poly(aryl ether) dendron (TPD) exhibited â€œdual-detectionâ€ towards cations and anions (Fe3+ ion and I- for IPD and Cu2+, Al3+, F- and Cl- for TPD) through fluorescence â€œturn-onâ€ sensing. All the designed molecular probes exhibit stability and reversibility, enabling them for real world applications. The details of the work will be presented during the seminar.\r\nReference:\r\n1.	S.

However, due to some of its short-comings and the need to meet specific requirements, it has been derivatized extensively throughout the literature. Its derivatives are highly tunable and small changes in their substituents or Ï€-conjugation can drastically change the optical properties. It has been shown that triple bonds protect anthracene greatly against photo-oxidation and impart incredible stability. [1] Among such derivatives, 9,10-bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BPEA) is a very well-known industrial dye. BPEA and its derivatives have been widely studied and have been functionally employed in various fields such as photovoltaics, organic light-emitting diodes, fluorescent sensors, optical waveguides as well as in bio-applications. [2,3,4] Nevertheless, their monosubstituted analogues are an overlooked class of molecules. Hence, the primary focus of this work is to understand the photophysics of these basic building blocks by studying a class of similar molecules with different donor and acceptor substituents. It was found that these push-pull molecules exhibit significant charge transfer characteristics with wide emission window and excellent fluorescence quantum yields. [5] Various experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that their excited state structures and characteristics are strongly influenced by the specific donor or acceptor substituent, which gives them a high degree of tunability. Their uses in white light emission and moisture sensing; along with their remarkable emission responses towards environment polarity, temperature and viscosity make them an attractive class of molecules. The detailed investigations, including the experimental details and results, will be discussed during the seminar.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.	W. Fudickar et. al., J. Am. Chem.

This research aims to chemically modify few biopolymers and one commonly used functional polymer (PVA) using solvent-free methods, including vapor-phase and solid-state techniques. The first study involved the carboxymethylation of chitosan through solvent-free mixing with monochloroacetic acid and heating, leading to extensive crosslinking via electrostatic interactions between carboxylic acid and amine groups.[2] The resulting crosslinked carboxymethyl chitosan shows promise for applications in dye adsorption from acidic media and as a recoverable organocatalyst for organic reactions requiring acid stability. In the second study, PVOH was modified through heating with dichloroacetic acid without any additional reagents, resulting in the formation of an organo-soluble poly(vinyl alcohol-co-vinyl dichloroacetate) copolymer.[3] This water-insoluble copolymer was self-extinguishing, did not melt-drip or glow upon combustion, and could coat dummy currency notes to impart flame-retardant properties, highlighting its potential for flame-retardant applications. In the third study, nucleophilic biopolymers such as alkaline lignin and chitosan were modified by exposure to organohalide vapors, specifically allyl bromide and epichlorohydrin, without any catalysts or pretreatments. Fuming with epichlorohydrin introduced 1,3-glyceryl bridges and significantly crosslinked the biopolymers, while allyl bromide vapors facilitated O- or N-allylation. These modifications render the biopolymers suitable as versatile materials for further reactions or stabilize the various physical forms. Lastly, hydroxyl-rich polymers, including cellulose and chitin as well as agricultural residues like sawdust, coconut fibers, and rice husks, were successfully carbonized at low temperatures using novel carbonizing agents. The resulting carbonaceous materials showcase immense environmental remediation potential, and the developed solid-state, low-temperature methodology also presents a novel route to synthesize fluorescent carbon nanoparticles.\r\n[1] J.

However, though chatbots are making progress in having human-like conversations, there is a gap in research regarding enhancing the user experience through the form-based (visual and anthropomorphic) cues of the chatbot. This dissertation aims to address the research question regarding the impact of these design cues on user experience through the perspective of flow theory. \r\nThis study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 involved two survey-based studies (Study 1 â€“ moderate risk, Leviâ€™s, and Study 2 â€“ High risk, Jeep India) to  understand the correlations between the different design cues, antecedents and factors associated with flow under two scenarios of perceived risk. The results from Phase 1 showed that irrespective of the level of perceived risk, the functional design cues are fundamental to the chatbot. Of the two form-based design cues, in moderate-risk scenarios, such as purchasing a pair of jeans, conversational anthropomorphic cues are positively related to social presence and perceived challenge. At the same time, they increase perceived social presence and ease of use in high-risk scenarios, such as purchasing a car. \r\nIn Phase 2, two experimental studies were conducted. For the moderate-risk scenario, a 2 (Aesthetics: High, Low) x 2(Conversational Anthropomorphism: High, Low) full factorial experimental design was used. For the high-risk scenario, we conducted a one-shot field experiment where 134 real-time potential Hyundai / Volkswagen car customers were asked to interact with the respective chatbot. The results of Phase 2 comment further on combating the negative impact of aesthetic cues on user experience with chatbots. The results show that in moderately risky scenarios, aesthetics does not always have a negative impact on flow but only has a negative impact when the level of conversational anthropomorphic cues is higher. However, as the risk increases, it is seen that aesthetics have a negative impact on flow irrespective of the level of conversational anthropomorphic cues. However, results also show that in the case of high-risk chatbots, expressive aesthetic cues, or cues that contribute to the sophistication and creativity of the chatbot rather than to its organization, impact flow positively.\r\nThis study offers important implications for academicians and practitioners alike. The results of this thesis contribute to a growing body of academic research and literature on chatbots and integrate concepts from fundamental disciplines such as design science and user experience by opening up research on the topic. This research also has several critical managerial implications. This paper acts as a guide for chatbot designers and throws caution to practitioners regarding the use of highly visually appealing chatbots at different levels of risk and provides a way to mitigate this negative effect. With the advent of generative AI and the chatbot boom, this research becomes an essential piece of insight into designing and developing highly functional and human-like chatbots that provide optimal user experience.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION.-web confernce link https://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmad','','',1,'2024-05-02 12:27:49','Active'),(278,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','Compact Model Validation and Extraction of Accurate Thermal Resistance of GaN HEMTs','Mr. Ajay Shanbhag Govindray (EE18D415) ','Ph.D Scholar Department of Electrical Engineering ','Guide: Dr. Amitava DasGupta','Electrical Engineering','2024/05/10 16:00','2024-05-10','yes','Online','We present the IIT Madras Compact Model (ICM) for GaN HEMTs, a comprehensive charge-based compact model that accurately captures DC, transient, and RF characteristics, including secondary effects like traps, access-region behavior, and self-heating.

A fixed offshore platform is typically designed for 25 years using the working stress design principle as per API RP 2A (WSD). The usage of the jacket structures may be extended due to the availability of oil and gas. Normally the life extension beyond original design will be 1 to 10 years. The design environmental period for the corresponding extended life is estimated using the encounter probability method. Then the structural integrity of the jacket structures is assessed using the ultimate strength assessment and the system reliability analysis methods. The ultimate strength assessment is defined in terms of Reserve Strength Ratio (RSR) of the jacket structures. The Reserve Strength Ratio (RSR) is a ratio of reserve capacity of the jacket structure to the design level environmental loads. However, the risk-based assessment of the jacket structures is evaluated based on the system probability of failure. \r\nIn this study, a typical jacket structure is selected, and the ultimate strength assessment of the jacket structure is evaluated using the push over analysis. The fault tree analysis method has been used to determine the critical member failure path of the jacket structure. Then the system probability of failure of the jacket structures has been computed using the First Order Reliability Method (FORM). Further this study aims to evaluate the required extended life of the aged jacket structure based on the encounter probability method. Finally, the present study proposes the acceptance criteria, recertification guidelines and the life extension recommendation of the jacket structure using the structural integrity and life extension assessment.\r\n','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-03 07:14:20','Active'),(282,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Supporting complex simulations with open source software','Prof. Wolfgang Bangerth ','Prof. Wolfgang Bangerth is currently a professor in the Department of Mathematics and a professor (by courtesy) in the Department of Geosciences at Colorado State University.

The major requirements for 3D concrete printing (3DCP) are dependent on pumpability, extrudability, buildability, and open time (all together called as printability). To achieve the rheological requirements for these design parameters, 3DCP mixture composition are designed with more binder content than conventional concrete. However, using a higher binder percentage in 3DCP creates challenges associated with sustainability. So, there is a need to use sustainable binder systems to reduce the environmental impact caused due to large scale carbon-dioxide emissions. Therefore, developing a low-carbon printable mixtures with the use of different alternative cementitious binders is important. Although, due to the use of sustainable binders, fast changing material properties at fresh state is observed which need to be studied. The use of sustainable binders in 3DCP has driven research into adapting various suites of test methods to assess these rigorous requirements. The current study presents a methodology to achieve a printable mix design for different sustainable binders used in construction industry. This study focuses on defining a range of test methods and its permissible suits of values which aims to measure different parameters such as flow spread value at fresh state, open time, setting time, static and dynamic yield stress growth with respect to time and phase separation assessment.','R.

This seminar will highlight the synthesis and application of innovative sustainable nanocomposites for the adsorptive removal of heavy metals from wastewater.1 Utilizing a combination of biodegradable polymers and environmentally benign nanoparticles, these nanocomposites offer a dual advantage of high adsorption capacity and ecological safety. The research methodology involved the synthesis of nanocomposites using materials such as chitosan, cellulose, and graphene oxide, which were then functionalized with metal oxide nanoparticles to enhance their affinity towards specific heavy metals like arsenic, fluoride, and uranium.2,3 Batch adsorption experiments demonstrated that these nanocomposites achieve superior removal efficiencies, attributable to their large surface area and the specific interaction between the metal ions and functional groups on the nanocomposites.4 The findings suggest that sustainable nanocomposites represent a promising, cost-effective, and eco-friendly approach for the removal of heavy metals from contaminated water sources, aligning with the goals of environmental sustainability and pollution mitigation. Future studies are recommended to explore the scalability of this technology and its efficacy in diverse real-world wastewater treatment scenarios. \r\nReferences:\r\n(1)	Taghipour, S.; Hosseini, S.

When the alphabet size is large compared to the number of samples, a portion of the distribution is highly likely to be unobserved or sparsely observed, and the error of the empirical distribution estimator is bounded below by missing mass, defined as the sum of probabilities over the missing letters. The Good-Turing (GT) estimator for missing mass is the ratio of the number of letters occuring once in the samples to the sample size. GT estimator is an important tool in large-alphabet distribution estimation and is widely used in natural language modelling for smoothing the empirical estimates. In this work, we propose various new notions and generalizations of missing mass that are useful to infer the missing parts of distributions from samples and characterize the minimax squared error risk of estimating these new types of missing mass under different sampling models, including those with memory. We show that the GT estimator or its appropriate modifications are minimax rate optimal for the proposed types of missing mass. We also propose new notions of concentration that provide better tail probability bounds, than sub-Gaussian concentration, for missing mass and its generalizations.

However, this process of reproductive angiogenesis is compromised in woman suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) leading to recurrent pregnancy loss and infertility in them. Studies have shown that circulating leukocytes are indispensable for reproductive angiogenesis, wherein, they participate by either trans-differentiating into endothelial-like cells or by secreting angiogenic factors. Previous study from our lab demonstrated that the circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from insulin resistant PCOS women exhibit defective adherence to fibronectin, one of the earliest steps necessary for leukocyte mediated homing and remodelling. Unlike Caucasians, Indian PCOS women do not exhibit overt hyperandrogenism, and instead, appearance of insulin resistance is more prevalent them. This is also corroborated by the fact that the use of insulin sensitizer, metformin, improves menstrual cyclicity, ovulation, fertility and endometrial receptivity in them, thereby demonstrating a strong link between Insulin resistance and female reproduction. The present study aims at unravelling the molecular reasons for impaired vasculogenic ability of PBMCS in PCOS women. Age matched PCOS and control women were recruited based on the Rotterdam criteria in this study. PCOS women exhibited higher fasting glucose and were found to be insulin resistant when compared to control subjects. These women also showed enlargement in their left ovary and increased endometrial thickness. PBMCs from PCOS women showed defective adherence on fibronectin, collagen and laminin but not on gelatin. Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) based proteomics was performed on PBMC fractions of recruited subjects to determine differential protein expression in these cells. Although the proteomic analysis did not show any change in the abundance of integrins between control and PCOS women, cell surface analysis using flow cytometry demonstrated a decrease in number of PBMCs positive for fibronectin binding integrins in PCOS women. The mechanism behind this still needs to be investigated. Since there is no established cell culture-based model available to mimic the endocrine imbalance observed during PCOS, attempts were made to establish a high fat high sucrose (HFHS) based PCOS model in C57BL6J mice.  HFHS based diet model of PCOS in C57BL6J female mice did not show any alterations in glucose metabolism but showed 50% success rate in development of polycystic ovaries. These mice also developed dyslipidaemia and altered liver function. The talk will summarize the observations obtained from aforementioned human and mice studies.

These nanoclusters exhibit quantum behavior, such as discrete electronic energy levels and size-dependent optical properties, like molecules, due to their small size and precise structure.1 Nanoclusters, typically made up of a few to several tens of atoms, display unique electrical,2 optical,3 magnetic,4 and catalytic5 properties that significantly distinguish them from both molecules and larger nanoparticles. These properties of nanoclusters make them ideal for various applications, ranging from highly efficient catalysts for chemical reactions to ultra-sensitive sensors and novel electronic devices. Furthermore, atomically precise nanoclusters offer tunability in structure and properties that are hard to achieve with larger nanoparticles and bulk materials. Because traditional materials currently in use are unable to maintain their stability and the attributes at very tiny scales,2 functional materials made of nanoclusters are highly desirable for a variety of applications. Because of their easy tuneability, understanding these traits in detail will aid in the design and synthesis of nanocluster materials with desired qualities. My proposal entails exploring the different features of nanoclusters and associated crystals, with the goal of employing them for a range of applications. I will be exploring the mechanical properties (to understand behaviour of clusters under stress), gas adsorption characteristics (for catalysis and gas storage), electrical transport (aiding in nanodevice development) and magnetic properties (to propose new class of molecular magnets). I will go over a thorough review of the literature in this seminar, along with some ideas on how to advance the subject of nanocluster research in the future.\r\nReferences\r\n(1)	Chakraborty, I.; Pradeep, T.

To this end, we distinguish spillover effects into horizontal (intra-industry linkages) and vertical (backward or downstream and forward or upstream inter-industry linkages) spillovers. As a first step, semi-parametric methods are used to estimate firm level productivity. Further, we investigate productivity spillover across industries based on their technology intensity. The study finds that backward spillovers from the downstream MNEs is the only source of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) gains. Findings also suggest that industry heterogeneity is a key driver of FDI spillovers. As a second objective, this study analyze effects of firm capabilities on FDI spillover. We examines linear relation between absorptive capacity and technology spillover and further test the presence of nonlinear threshold effects. We find that the intermediate technology gap between domestic and foreign firms substantiates favorable impact of FDI spillovers on high-tech industries. As a final objective, we distinguish foreign subsidiaries based on their innovative activities into knowledge creator (KC) and knowledge user (KU) types. Econometric analysis shows that domestic suppliers of intermediate inputs benefit by interacting with the knowledge-creating subsidiaries. Notably, the backward-vertical linkage is primarily strong in the case of knowledge creators.\r\n','HSS OFFICE','hsoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkMeet link: meet.google.com/szm-refx-vej','','',1,'2024-05-06 05:13:51','Active'),(294,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','Prediction And Reduction of Flow Induced Sound Generated by Cross Flow Past Circular Cylinders','Mr. Karthik K, Ph.D. scholar, Roll No. OE14D023 ','Mr. Karthik K, Ph.D. scholar, Roll No. OE14D023 ','DR.

Typically formed under high-pressure, low-temperature conditions and naturally found on deep ocean floors.1 However, their formation under low-temperature, high-vacuum laboratory conditions raises questions about their existence in the interstellar medium (ISM). Over 300 simple and complex molecules, including water, have been detected in the ISM in gas/solid phases. The extreme conditions of low temperature and pressure in the ISM prompt inquiries into the complex chemistry occurring through thermal and energetic processes in space.2 Here, we focused on the study simulating ISM conditions (P ~ 10-10 mbar, T~10-100 K) using a custom-built ultra-high vacuum (UHV) instrument. Our investigation primarily targets the formation of CHs and the evolution of molecules within their cages through thermal and photochemical processes utilizing techniques such as reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy, reflection high-energy electron diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. We showed the formation of ethane, dimethyl ether (DME), tetrahydrofuran THF, and 1,3- dioxalane CHs at temperatures of 60,125 and 135 K, respectively, in UHV. Additionally, thermally annealing mixed CHs of THF, DME, and carbon dioxide (CO2) induces the transformation of CO2 from sI to sII hydrate structures.3,4 Moreover, the investigation into the photolysis of DME CH underscores the importance of radical recombination processes within water cages, suggesting a mechanism for the selective formation of photoproducts. Our findings provide insights into the complex chemistry occurring in space environments, shedding light on the potential formation mechanisms of CHs and the evolution of molecules within them in the ISM.\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

To improve the response time of the relief operations, the ground vehicles are integrated with unmanned aerial vehicles to distribute the relief kits to communities in the event of a disaster. The problem discussed solves the routing and scheduling of heterogeneous vehicles and drones in a disaster-hit region considering split delivery. The second problem that we consider is the optimization of the solid waste management network in a city in India to minimize the total costs.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a sustainable method of converting solar energy into hydrogen.1 PEC involves two set of reactions hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The n-type metal-based semiconductors such as TiO2, SrTiO3, Ta2O5 can be tuned as photoanode materials to carry out oxygen evolution reaction. These materials can be easily synthesized by anodization and hydrothermal methods.2,3 However, OER is a 4-electron process and occurs at high potential of 1.23 VRHE. This makes OER a sluggish and energy intensive process. Conversely, HER is a two-electron mechanism that only happens at 0 VRHE. p-type semiconductors work best as photocathodes3. But obtaining p-type metal oxides with high hole mobility is difficult due to the considerable localization of holes around valence band edge of the metal oxides because of their ionicity. As a potential cure, covalency might be introduced to the metal-oxygen bonding to promote the formation of an enlarged valence-band structure. However, the synthesised p-type (Cu2O, CaFe2O4) semiconductors either exhibit photo-corrosion or have extremely limited charge mobility.4,5 The efficiency of the photoelectrochemical cell can be raised by using inexpensive, photostable photoelectrodes if n-type semiconductors are able to function as both photocathodes and photoanodes. To use n-type semiconductors as photocathodes, shallow trap levels must be introduced in order to capture photoexcited electrons and perform photoreduction6. It has been observed that doping with transition metals, such as Fe3+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Cr3+, is an effective way to create impurity levels, or trap states, in an array of metal oxides. Additionally, the doped transition metals aid in lowering the rate of recombination, which raises the efficiency of metal oxide7. Inducing defects is another excellent method of creating trap states below the conduction band of semiconductors. Role of N-defects in photocathodic behaviour of g-C3N4 has been successfully explored6. Based on these considerations, we have synthesised n-type semiconductors, Mn/Fe-TNT@Ti-500, N-doped SrTiO3, SBA-15/Mn/Fe-TNT@Ti-500, N-doped g-C3N4 and examined their potential use as photoelectrodes for overall water splitting.8 The results obtained on these photoactive materials will be discussed in this colloquium. \r\nReferences\r\n1.

The opportunities arise out of the potential to reduce undesirable and detrimental environmental changes and challenges in the form of excess load on the electricity transmission networks. This energy shift when supported by solar power, which is already emerging as a big contributor to the generation of electricity in the Indian ecosystem can be sustained. There is, however, a need to study how these changes to supply and demand align and the adaptations needed to ensure successful integration of the new. In this study, we, therefore, investigate how EVs change the electricity distribution scenarios in the Indian market. First, We look at the question of when to charge an electric vehicle by simulating the different scenarios and optimising for best distribution of demand. Next, we identify contract structures that would incentivise owners to follow the identified charging patterns. Finally, we explore whether the design would work as intended by validating the user behaviour via surveys and qualitative interviews.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','RESEARCH PROPOSAL SEMINAR -web confernce link https://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadra','','',1,'2024-05-06 13:40:55','Active'),(300,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','A Systematic Investigation of Detectors for Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio EMG Signals for application in EMG driven robot assisted therapy for severe stroke.','Ms. Monisha Yuvaraj (AM20D750)','Guide(s): Dr. S K M Varadhan & Dr. Sivakumar Balasubramanian, CMC, Vellore','Ph.

About 30% of stroke survivors are severely impaired and require physical assistance to actively engage in movement training. Robotic assistance can motivate such patients to attempt and train movements. When the robotic assistance is contingent on the intention to move, it may be an effective way to guide neuroplasticity. For severely impaired stroke patients with no residual movements, a surface electromyogram (EMG) is a viable option for detecting movement intention. Although numerous algorithms for EMG detection exist, the detector with the highest accuracy and lowest latency for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals remains unknown. Therefore, there is a need to identify an optimal EMG detector that can provide seamless, naturalistic human-machine interaction during robot-assisted therapy.\r\nTo this end, we investigated the performance of 13 existing EMG detection algorithms on simulated low SNR (0 dB and -3 dB) EMG signals generated using three different EMG signal models: Gaussian, Laplacian, and biophysical models. The detector performance was quantified using the false positive rate (FPR), false negative rate (FNR), and detection latency. Any detector that consistently showed FPR and FNR of no more than 20%, and latency of no more than 50 ms, was considered an appropriate detector for use in robot-assisted therapy.\r\nThe results indicate that the Modified Hodges detector â€“ a simplified version of the threshold-based Hodges detector â€“ introduced in the current work, was the most consistent detector across the different signal models and SNRs. It consistently performed for ~90% and ~40% of the tested trials for 0 dB and -3 dB SNR, respectively. The two statistical detectors (Gaussian and Laplacian Approximate Generalized Likelihood Ratio) and the Fuzzy Entropy detectors have a slightly lower performance than Modified Hodges.\r\nOverall, the Modified Hodges, Gaussian and Laplacian Approximate Generalized Likelihood Ratio, and the Fuzzy Entropy detectors were identified as the potential candidates that warrant further investigation with real surface EMG data since they had consistent detection performance on low SNR EMG data.\r\n','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline Meeting link: https://meet.google.com/ert-dvas-fnm','','',1,'2024-05-07 04:24:22','Active'),(301,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Physically derived instantaneous modelling of complex current-voltage waveform-controlled arc-wire DED process - Residual stress and distortion analysis.','Mr. Pradeep.

One of the key challenges of DED-made components is related to the thermally induced\r\nresidual stresses and distortion. The temperature gradient is caused mainly due localized heat input, and\r\nan accumulation of excessive heat in the fabricated part often leads to undesirable failures, such as poor\r\ndimensional tolerances due to the generation of residual stresses and degradation of mechanical\r\nproperties. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the influencing factors that impact the generation and\r\ndistribution of residual stress in DED-made components. In this work, numerical investigations to\r\nanalyse the evolution of the thermal profile, residual stress, and distortion during the deposition of\r\naluminium alloy 4047 wire on aluminium alloy (A1050, A6060) substrates were examined using a finite\r\nelement-based analysis. A novel Data-Driven Model approach described by the physically derived\r\ninstantaneous process parameters was used with the existing FE approach to model the multilayer\r\ndeposition by the wire-arc DED process. The temperature distribution, residual stress generation, and\r\ndistortion were investigated in three different substrates: a block (Case I), a large plate (Case II), and a\r\nsmall plate (Case III). The numerical results were validated with experimentally measured data. The\r\nproposed DDM-based thermo-mechanical simulation predicted the peak temperature with a mean\r\nrelative error of 3.3 %, 4.8 %, and 3.4 % for the three cases considered, respectively. Furthermore, the\r\nmagnitude and variation trend of the residual stress and distortion near the deposited region in Case III\r\nagreed well with the experimental results. The simulated results of the DDM approach show the\r\nsignificance of the boundary conditions, especially the clamping, in mitigating the residual stressinduced distortion of DED-processed parts.\r\n','EDOffice','edoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-07 06:57:44','Active'),(302,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','â€œClassification of multi symmetric products of a curve and its applications\"','Dr.Arijit Mukherjee ','IPDF, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras.','.','Department of Mathematics','2024/05/08 15:00','2024-05-08','yes','NAC Room No.519, 5th Floor.',': In this talk, we completely classify multi symmetric products, i.e product of symmetric products, of a curve.

These coping mechanisms are called hardship financing practices, such as selling assets or livestock and borrowing from friends, family, or money lenders to smoothen consumption expenditure. Examining data from two waves of the NSSO (71st and 75th rounds), this thesis delves into the scope and drivers of hardship financing and its resultant financial strain in India. Logistic regression analysis reveals cancer as the predominant cause of hardship financing among the study population. Over time, there\'s a decrease in hardship financing for inpatients but an increase for outpatients. Employing a multivariate decomposition analysis, we investigate the factors driving the decline in inpatient hardship financing, noting that while factors such as catastrophic health expenditure have impoverishing effects on hardship financing, there is evidence of a potential to slow down this negative impact. Furthermore, significant rural-urban disparities in hardship financing are uncovered. The Fairlie decomposition analysis underscores income status and living conditions as pivotal factors exacerbating rural disadvantage in hardship financing. A qualitative analysis in Kerala\'s Pathanamthitta district highlights inadequate government interventions, subpar conditions in government hospitals, poor savings practices, and loss of employment due to illness as key contributors to hardship financing.

This study aims to locate the ways in which photographs became part of the processes of survival and resurgence for the exiled Sri Lankan Tamil community settled in Tamil Nadu, India. Addressing a notable lacuna in scholarly discourse concerning the Sri Lankan refugee community in India and the limited corpus of photographic documentation, this study proposes a comprehensive inquiry into visual materials using the tools of socio-cultural and visual anthropology. By focusing on family albums as primary source material, this ethnographic investigation seeks to unravel the intricate interplay between photography and the lived experiences of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, probing the complexities of displacement and resilience amid protracted conflict dynamics. This narrative extends beyond sensationalized images, embracing the quotidian experiences of ordinary individuals impacted by the conflict.\r\n\r\nAcknowledging the dynamic nature of photographs, this research attempts to decipher the nuanced meanings embedded within images amidst war. Beyond mere visual representation, the inquiry delves into the multifaceted processes encompassing the production, dissemination, circulation, preservation, and even obliteration of photographs. Central to this exploration is the theme of displaced imagery, particularly the photographs carried by Sri Lankan Tamil refugees fleeing their homeland, which encapsulate narratives persisting despite displacement. Within this framework, attention is directed towards elucidating the phenomenon of lost or damaged images, illuminating the poignant narratives and memories immortalized therein, even in their absence. Specifically, this study scrutinizes the significance of seemingly mundane photographs originating from everyday life, which assume pivotal roles in the cultural, social, and legal spheres of the refugee community, fostering notions of identity and evidentiary citizenship. Extending this discourse, the analyzed images are positioned within the broader photographic history of Sri Lanka and South Asia, underscoring their enduring relevance. Through this inquiry, the aim is to solicit narratives encapsulated within images, interwoven with themes of displacement, identity, memory, home, encampment, and culture.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Photography; Memory; Refugee; Visual Anthropology','HSS OFFICE','hsoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-07 08:37:10','Active'),(306,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL',' GENTLE REMINDER - Supporting complex simulations with open source software','Prof. Wolfgang Bangerth','Prof. Wolfgang Bangerth is currently a professor in the Department of Mathematics and a professor (by courtesy) in the Department of Geosciences at Colorado State University.

Each subject has specific patterns because of the spatial origin, change in amplitude and brain signals thus calibration process is necessary. In present BCI systems, calibration is often tedious process which cause mental fatigue for the subject. The extended calibration time has thus become a significant drawback of BCI systems. Furthermore, for real-time BCI applications, it is imperative to enhance classification accuracy and reduce the complexity of deep learning models used for classifying MI-EEG signals. To address these challenges, we employed a genetic algorithm-based transfer learning approach to transfer knowledge from known subjects to unknown subjects. Additionally, we introduced an EEG channel-wise attention module and a hard trial removal methodology to improve classification accuracy of the deep learning model.

SNS provides a platform for various communities and creates a dark world of cybercrimes. Cybercriminals utilize social media to gather information, plan, and commit offenses. The increasing occurrence of cybercrimes on SNS platforms has drawn growing research interest. Consequently,  a systematic analysis was conducted using 26 research articles from reputed journals, predominantly from Information Systems. From this analysis, we identified three primary themes concerning cybercrimes: first is direct cybercrimes, where offenders directly harm victims (such as cyberbullying and cyberstalking); second is indirect cybercrimes, where offenders influence targets to engage in criminal activities (including cyberactivism and crime sensing); and third is the impact of cybercrime on SNS users. We also propose a conceptual framework grounded in the Routine Activity Theory (RAT) for analyzing cybercrimes. These themes and theoretical foundation address cybercrime from offendersâ€™ perspectives and their behavior. However, little attention has been given to constructing a cybercrime typology from the victim\'s perspective and assessing the severity of cybercrime. For this mapping of a set of reported cybercrimes to the formal crime types defined in the Indian Penal Code, IT Act 2000, and the amendments thereof is proposed. Further, a measurement process will be developed to score cybercrimes based on their severity. This will involve pilot testing, establishing baseline scores, formal scoring by various subject groups, and tests for reliability and validity. In order to establish internal consistency, two scales will be used: an interval scale and a ratio scale with a standard crime item for scoring. To establish validity and reliability through correlations,  four different subject groups were engaged related to cybercrimes. This research will contribute to the IS body of knowledge in cybercrimes by developing a measurement process to generate actionable information.

The use of such systems all across the world\r\nhighlights the need for understanding their behavior and response across a wide range of system\r\ndetails and sea conditions. Various parameters such as water depth, mooring line length, direction\r\nof wave incidence, significant wave height, truncation of mooring lines, 3D sea state environment\r\netc. have significant impact on the dynamic behavior of FPSOs and on the fatigue lives of their\r\nmooring lines. A study on summarizing the effect of changes in the above mentioned parameters\r\nis the focus of the present work. A standard FPSO (300m long; 1000m water depth) is modelled\r\nand analyzed using ANSYS AQWA. Then, using this as the base model, multiple variations of it\r\nare created to capture and study the effects of changes in parameters.\r\nThe first part of the study is about revisiting the concept of truncation of mooring lines. A\r\ntruncated model is created which effectively reduces the water depth from 1000m in the real world\r\nto a truncated water depth of 300m. This procedure finds significance in wave basin studies. The\r\neffect of the changes in the behavior of FPSOs upon truncating its mooring lines are studied and\r\ndocumented. The results showcase the effectiveness of the truncation procedure upon a standard\r\nFPSO system. The second part of the study is a broad parametric study of the FPSO system.\r\nVariations of the base model are created with changes in various parameters such as water depth,\r\nmooring line length, direction of wave incidence, significant wave height, 2D to 3D sea state\r\nenvironment etc. The respective models are then compared to one another. The results here\r\nshowcase the trends in the behavior of FPSOs across changes in each particular parameter. The\r\nthird part of the study is a fatigue analysis.

Variations\r\nof the base model are created with changes in various parameters such as water depth, mooring\r\nline length, direction of wave incidence, significant wave height, 3D to 2D sea state environment,\r\ntruncation of mooring lines etc. A sea state is modelled for fatigue analysis, which constitutes of a\r\n3D JONSWAP wave loading along with appropriate wind and current loading. A deterministic\r\nfatigue analysis is conducted to calculate the fatigue damage. The damage is then expressed in\r\nterms of fatigue lives of the respective mooring lines, and compared from model to model.

A typical body-in-white of a passenger car may contain up to 6000 similar and dissimilar resistance spot welds. These welded structures undergo vibration from road surface, engine, floor panel, etc., and the resultant cyclic loading on the spot welds leads to fatigue failure. The performance of the welds under dynamic and static loading is therefore crucial to ensure the long-life of an automotive vehicle. Recently, ultrahigh strength steel sheets with lesser thicknesses are being used in the automobile industries to fabricate car bodies. The current research is on the understanding of fatigue failure mechanisms in similar and dissimilar resistance spot welded joints of DP 980 steel and boron-added ultrahigh strength steel.\r\n\r\nSpot welding was done with welding parameters optimized for industrially accepted nugget diameter. DP 980 steel â€“ DP 980 steel joints, boron steel â€“ boron steel joints and DP 980 steel â€“ boron steel joints were made. A few sheets of DP 980 steel were deformed in uniaxial tension to different levels and then the sheets were spot welded. Also, double pulsed resistance spot welding was used to weld DP 980 steel and boron steel. Microstructural observations were made on the welds and microhardness was measured. Tensile testing was done on the spot-welded specimens in lap shear mode. Fatigue testing was conducted on the spot-welded specimens in lap shear mode at different maximum load levels (5 to 40 % of weld strength) with the load ratio of 0.1. Fracture surfaces of the tested samples were observed using a scanning electron microscope.\r\n\r\nThree different types of fatigue failure mechanisms are observed for the welded joints of DP 980 steel and boron steel: eyebrow shape failure at low loads, partial plug failure at intermediate loads and plug failure at high loads. The transition in the fatigue failure mechanism from the eyebrow shape failure to the partial plug failure was observed when the maximum cyclic load was corresponding to 25 % of weld strength.

Cavitation represents a specific form of damage wherein pre-existing micro-voids or defects rapidly expand into voids and cavities of comparable sizes when stress is applied, ultimately leading to structural failure. This phenomenon results in localized reductions in density at those locations. Leveraging this understanding, we conceptualize pre-existing defects within elastomeric bodies as regions of lower density and ascertain the initiation of damage by monitoring density reductions across different locations within the body under varying loads. To validate this approach, we formulated and solved various boundary value problems to simulate the loading conditions experienced by elastomeric components containing weld lines. \r\nA weldline emerges as a defect in molding when two or more polymeric melt fronts meet and solidify during the mold filling process. Due to factors such as limited molecular chain diffusion across the interface, weak bonding between the joined skin layers, and the presence of air traps, the mechanical properties of the weldline region are inferior to those of the parent material. Consequently, the density in the weldline region is slightly lower. In our research, we model the weldline region with reduced density compared to the rest of the body and define material parameters as functions of this non-uniform density field. By applying load, we monitor density reductions at different locations to pinpoint the initiation of damage within the body. We employ an inhomogeneous compressible isotropic Gent model to represent the elastomeric material. Our analysis involves subjecting an elastomeric plate with a hole containing a weld line to various loading conditions and examining the initiation of damage in each scenario. Furthermore, when examining the problem of a plate containing a weldline, we explore how geometric characteristics such as orientation, length, and curvature of the weldline impact the initiation of damage.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-07 11:01:34','Active'),(313,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Development of Earth-Abundant Transition Metal-Based Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Rechargeable Zinc-Air Batteries','Ms. Terlapu Sai Vani (MM18D703)','Ph.D Scholar, Dept. of MME','Guide: Dr. Ranjit Bauri','Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering','2024/05/08 15:00','2024-05-08','yes','Seminar Hall (NAC 222)','The escalating global energy demand and environmental pollution have necessitated the \r\ndevelopment of advanced energy storage and conversion technologies.

Nevertheless, the challenges associated with variations in lithological distributions associated with the presence of shale layers, fractures, faults and leaky wells can affect the storage and the operational aspects of CO2 sequestration in these formations. The present work focuses on developing a mathematical model for understanding CO2 migration in different deep saline aquifers, such as heterogeneous and leaky deep saline aquifers. The present study is carried out to understand the impact of different petro-physical parameters of the deep saline aquifers on the migration and dissolution of CO2 gas in brine during sequestration operations. Further, the present model is extended with a thermo-hydraulic coupling to understand the effect of the degree of heterogeneity in porosity and permeability evolution and leakage rates from a leakage path during CO2 injection into a deep saline aquifer. The results depict that the plume length of CO2 gas is significantly influenced by changes in permeability, injection velocity, capillarity and interfacial tension. During sequestration, the permeability of the heterogeneous aquifer is observed to vary, which is expressed in terms of the permeability ratio (k/k0) by about 1.07 to 1.01 magnitudes in the low permeable conditions. Similarly, a significant modification in the average porosity is also observed, varying from a minimum of 0.791 % to a maximum of 3.136 %. Further, during CO2 injection into the leaky aquifer, variations in leakage path distance from the injection source, the thickness of the leakage path, permeability, and depth of the aquifer and leakage path system are observed to affect the CO2 migration. It is critically observed that a variation in leakage thickness from 0.1 to 0.5 m and a decrease in the permeability from 10-13 m2 to 10-15 m2  projected a significant variation in normalised leakage rate from 0.04 to 0.38 and 0.22 to 0.004. Hence, the present studies help mitigate gas and optimise injection and monitoring strategies during field development for effective storage and ensure safe gas storage for longer durations.      \r\n\r\n','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-07 11:06:24','Active'),(315,'','Workshop',NULL,'Basics and Applications of EELS in Materials Science',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,'Please register here, which is mandatory:\r\n \r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M7uwZQJ2xT18iR7kDfa22tp_Pkmjpmi7wTkuHszLLXU/edit?usp=sharing\r\n \r\nThe registration fee is Rs. 2500 + GST, please find the payment gateway here https://code.iitm.ac.in/code-programs/ADSTT2024/','S.

Most of the existing classification algorithms for the MI based BCI systems use EEG data from multiple channels for decoding the MI tasks, which increase the computational complexity of the system, thereby expending a higher time. The aim of this research is to effectively classify the MI tasks by utilizing the EEG data acquired from a minimal number of channels. As the brainâ€™s oscillations are transient, there is a need to analyse the EEG signals in both time and frequency domains. But the existing time-frequency methods provide a suboptimal trade-off between the time and frequency resolutions, thereby hindering the analysis of the neuronal signals. A novel method using a set of Complex Morlet Wavelets (CMW), having frequency dependent widths is used in this work to generate high-resolution time-frequency representations (TFR) of the MI EEG signals. These TFRs are further given to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), built with minimal number of layers for classification. Generally, a CNN model requires a large amount of training data and needs to learn many hyperparameters to give an optimal performance. Simple CNN models having lesser hyperparameters are built in this work for classifying the MI data from a smaller dataset. The acquired results show that the proposed CNN models are able to classify the high-resolution TFRs of the MI tasks with a higher classification accuracy using data from a lesser number of channels.

Some of the popular HP methods include (i) the compensation heat pulse (CHP) method, (ii) the T-max method, and (iii) the heat ratio (HR) method. Most other sap flow methods use some variations of these basic methods. Although all these methods are based on the same theory, in practice, their accuracy varies depending on the estimated HP velocity. Some of the often-cited reasons for the differences in the performance of these methods are (i) wound effect, (ii) asymmetrical spacing of temperature probes, (iii) low logging frequency, (iv) sensor resolution, (v) electronic noise, (vi) drift in temperature measurements, etc. However, it is unclear why these error artifacts affect the performance of different methods at different HP velocity ranges. Here, we use mathematical model simulations to show that the presence of noise in temperature measurements constrains the measurable range of HP velocities of these different methods depending on the noise intensity. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we quantitatively assess the accuracy of these methods. While typical HP measurements log temperature data every second for about 3 min, most HP methods only use a few data points. We show that when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of these chosen data points is small, the accuracy suffers. By employing a sum of squares error minimization (SSEM) approach that minimizes the errors between observed and model-predicted temperatures using all the observed data points, we show that noise induced errors in sap flow measurement can be virtually eliminated over a range of conditions. At the same time, our research explores the thermal dynamics involved in sap flow estimation. By utilizing porous media concepts such as mechanical dispersion, we simplify the diurnal fluctuation of thermal diffusivity in sapwood. Employing a non-empirical method for parameter estimation from temperature curves, we demonstrate a significant reduction in estimation errors. Our study not only advances the mechanistic understanding of noise-induced errors in sap flow measurements but also introduces a novel approach to improve estimation accuracy through the integration of porous media principles. \r\n\r\n\r\n','R.

A number of physiological sensors are known to develop a BCI system, out of which electroencephalogram (EEG) is popular among practitioners as it is convenient and effective. Motor Imagery (MI) is defined as the â€œmental rehearsal of movements without the movements being executedâ€. BCI systems have utilized MI to control the action of devices such as wheelchairs or an object on the monitor (e.g., cursor). To date, most BCI systems research focused on synchronous control applications, where the system initiates the time period during which the user is expected to perform the MI task. Alternatively, asynchronous BCI systems are way close to the ideal conditions, where the users donâ€™t need to follow systems instructions, and they can intend MI activity whenever they want. In such systems, detecting a non-intentional activity period (i.e., no-control state) is equally important. Developing a classifier that classifies MI tasks efficiently and discriminates intentional MI tasks from the no-control state activity without having training samples for the no-control state is always critical. The aim of this work is to develop a self-paced asynchronous BCI system with robust non-control state detection using an endogenous brain switch, which can determine if the user wants to use the system, thereby reducing the number of false positive operations significantly. The details of the model formulation, salient results, and significance of the study will be presented in this seminar.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline Meeting link: https://meet.google.com/ago-vtgg-eex','','',1,'2024-05-08 06:34:49','Active'),(319,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Light-matter interaction in nanoscale and condensed phase media: spectroscopy, dynamics and applications','Mr. ANUBHAB SAHOO, (PH15D025)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide(s): Dr. Sivarama Krishnan & Dr. Ramachandra Rao M S','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/05/10 15:00','2024-05-10','yes','HSB - 209, Seminar Hall, Department of Physics ','Large band gap materials are transparent to low-intensity near-infrared (NIR) light. However, at sufficiently higher intensities, nonlinear absorption takes place by multiphoton processes and field-assisted collisional ionization. For longer pulse durations (Ï„_p), Ï„_p > 200 fs, laser-driven electrons can gain large kinetic energies by mechanisms such as inverse bremsstrahlung and electron avalanches, in short pulses, Ï„_p < 200 fs, these electrons are excited to the conduction band by multiphoton absorption [1]. In order to study field-dependent ionization processes, we have measured single-shot nonlinear transmission from the quartz crystal. The pulsewidth (50 fs - 1 ps) dependence of nonlinear transmission for laser pulses from a Ti: Sapphire femtosecond laser, tightly focused into quartz is discussed. The change in the absorption threshold as a function of pulsewidth and polarization is explained using the nonlinear ionization mechanism involved during the interaction [2].\r\nAs an application to the intense field interaction with materials we have established fs-pulsed laser ablation in liquid (fs-PLAL) technique to synthesize and control the optical properties of quantum dots (QDs). We have chosen ZnO, Mg-ZnO and MoS2 for studying the optical properties by varying the laser parameters i.e. pulsewidth and average power. Using this method, we have demonstrated the single-step reagent free synthesis of pristine ZnO QDs with selective tuning of emission properties by controlling the deep level defects. We have demonstrated the emission properties that can be used for fluorescent ink for anticounterfeit and pH sensing. Additionally, we have also demonstrated the enhancement of UV absorption and near band emission properties by doping Mg into the ZnO QDs [3]. During our investigation of the photoluminescence (PL) emission properties in MoS2 QDs synthesised using fs-PLAL method, we have discovered that the Stokes shift of ~ 1 eV is caused by the formation of a heterostructure between MoS2 and MoO3-x. To explain the large Stokes shift, a mechanism is proposed based on the electron transfer from MoS2 to MoO3-x, which is validated from excitation wavelength dependent PL and PL lifetime measurements [4].\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1]	P.

These rotor-shaft tilt angles are necessary for avoidance of tower strike of blades. Therefore, in modern wind turbines, a nacelle offset is present. Three different rotor-shaft tilt angles, viz, 3Âº, 5Âº, and 8Âº are chosen for the study. Firstly, a range of uniform wind speeds (seven values from below-rated to cut-out) is considered along with a significant wave height of 6m and peak period of 10s. The monopile with a rigid foundation (without soil effects) at the water depth of 20m is considered for the given turbine configuration. The analysis of the tower base moments, tip clearance, and blade pitch angle for these degrees of misalignment at different wind speeds has been made. In the process, the variation caused by this effect is shown. From the analysis, it is observed that the blade pitch angle is not much affected by the shaft misalignment, also it has been found that with an increase in the degree of misalignment tip clearance increases. The tower base roll moment and tower base torsion are significantly increased at the rated wind speed. The tower base torsion is significantly affected by shaft misalignment as compared to other loads and this loading effect is defined by the torsional load factor. This analysis is further extended to include the turbulent wind condition in the range of wind speeds from below-rated (i.e., 5m/s, 8m/s) to above-rated (i.e., 14m/s, 18m/s) to achieve more accurate prediction of loading patterns across various components of wind turbine. The effect of rotor-shaft tilt angle, and wind speed at different turbulence intensities, viz, A, B, C on various parameters have been analysed for the above-mentioned wind turbine configuration. The parameters that are analysed are loads entering the drivetrain i.e., rotor thrust, rotor torque, loads acting at the blade root system, loads that are acting on blades, Blade pitch angle, blade tip to tower clearance, and tower base loads. The effect of turbulence in the wind and rotor shaft tilt angle is analysed on the above-mentioned parameters. The change in rotor-shaft tilt angle could occur during installation and set-up activities, dynamics at the rotor-nacelle assembly sometimes cause the shaft to move out of the alignment. Hence, the effect of tilt angle on different parameters has been studied at various wind speeds with different turbulent intensities. Different turbulence intensities lead to different loading patterns on the wind turbine. It has been found that some parameters such as yaw bearing loads, and tower base moments have been significantly affected by both rotor-shaft tilt angle and turbulent wind speed conditions. Blade tip to tower clearance is varying by the change in rotor-shaft tilt angle. The blade pitch angle is greatly affected by the different turbulent intensities in the wind speed.\r\n\r\n','Department of Ocean Engineering','oeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-09 12:31:30','Active'),(326,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Computational investigation of liquid phase partial oxidation of methane to methanol on atomically dispersed catalysts.','MS.

Recently, there has been attention on atomically dispersed catalysts in metal oxide/zeolite supports for the aqueous phase partial oxidation of methane, using liquid hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant.\r\n\r\nAtomically dispersed Rh on t-ZrO2 and CeO2 nanowires (NWs) can convert methane to methanol using H2O2 as the oxidant and also form other products like CH3OOH and CO2. Here the objectives of this investigation are 1) to establish the active site characteristics of the 0.3 wt% of Rh on ZrO2 and 0.29 wt% of Rh on CeO2 NWs, satisfying all the experimental catalyst characterization data, 2) to identify an appropriate value of the Hubbard U correction for use with the Zr 4d states, and 3) to unravel the reaction mechanism and pathways for the formation of CH3OH and CH3OOH during methane oxidation on Rh/t-ZrO2 with hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. This investigation employed computational IR spectroscopy using CO as the probe molecule to identify the active site characteristics of supported Rh SAs on t-ZrO2 and CeO2 NWs. t-Rh0.03Zr0.97O2(200) and Rh0.02Ce0.98O2(110) surfaces show the formation of the geminal di-carbonyl with the computed vibrational frequencies closely matching those from the DRIFTS experiments in the literature. However, the widely studied t-Rh0.03Zr0.97O2(101) and Rh0.03Ce0.97O2(111) surfaces in the literature donâ€™t form geminal di-carbonyl on the surface. Investigations reinforce the need to carefully assess the characteristic active site motifs in single-atom catalysts formed in metal oxides. Additionally, CH4 and H2O probe molecules were utilized to estimate the Hubbard U for use with t-ZrO2, and Hubbard-U on Zr was obtained to be 2.5 eV. The mechanistic analysis of methane partial oxidation on t-Rh0.02Zr0.98O2(200) with U=2.5 eV on Zr revealed the critical role of CO in the formation of CH3OOH, which is one of the key products observed during the partial oxidation reaction.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the catalytic systems investigated in the literature use water as the solvent, a study on Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst showed that the use of a mixture of sulfolane and water as solvent enhanced methanol selectivity compared to water. Classical MD simulations of the reactants and the products in these solvents showed a substantial difference in transport properties, compared to water. The observed higher selectivity of methanol on the Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst in sulfolane and its aqueous mixtures could potentially be because of a combination of the effects on transport of the reactants and products, and their involvement in the elementary reactions. The current studies would be extended to predict the roles of solvent sulfolane in altering reaction mechanisms and energetics on t-Rh/ZrO2 as the catalytic system.','K P Geetha','choffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkONLINE: https://meet.google.com/fsk-vnta-bnuâ€¬â€¬','','',1,'2024-05-10 04:04:59','Active'),(327,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Ph.D SEMINAR TALK -II -  A System-Thinking-Based Synthesis of Critical Factors Influencing the Pathways to Resilient Safety Culture for Construction Projects of Different Sizes','Mr. Kaushik Bhattacharjee, Roll No. CE20D008','Ph.D Scholar','Dr. Nikhil Bugalia - Guide, Dr. Ashwin Mahalingam - Co-Guide, Dr. Koshy Varghese - DC Member, Dr. Sivakumar Palaniappan - DC Member, Dr. Shankar Narasimhan S (CH) - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head','Civil Engineering','2024/05/13 15:00','2024-05-13','yes','BSB 104 (Conference Room)','The varied nature of the construction industry, involving projects of different sizes, poses significant challenges to improving its Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) performance. One of the most prominent solutions is to develop a positive safety culture on construction projects.  Moreover, most existing literature analyzing the safety culture for construction projects either focuses on larger projects or does not distinguish the results for projects of varying sizes. However, the scarce existing literature identifying strategies for improving the safety culture of smaller construction projects has focused on a deterministic and reactive view of safety. The recent paradigms for safety management recognize the construction sector as a complex socio-technical system, producing \'irregularâ€™ or â€˜unexpected unknownâ€™ safety risks. Therefore, as an alternative, the Resilient Safety Culture (RSC) model, which focuses on developing adaptive capabilities to manage the ever-changing irregular and unforeseen safety risks, is deemed suitable. However, limited academic attention has been paid to identifying the pathways construction projects of different sizes need to follow to achieve RSC dimensions, through RSC-based practices. Therefore, the current study tries to answer the fundamental question â€œDo construction projects of different sizes have a uniform pathway to safety culture?â€ Literature also suggests that national-level safety governance structure plays a crucial role in promoting safety practices and, consequently, the safety culture of an organization. Safety governance structure represents how the laws and regulations surge through the different hierarchy levels of the construction industry by distributing the responsibility, accountability, and authority of the public and private safety stakeholders, leading to better safety management. Therefore, the role of the safety governance structure may also be crucial in achieving the RSC for construction projects of different sizes. However, the extant literature on identifying the features of a safety governance structure has been limited to unstructured and not necessarily rooted in theoretical frameworks for analyzing the governance structure of the construction industry. Hence, the current study also tries to address the important question â€œWhat are the characteristics of the existing construction safety governance structure that can affect the pathway to safety culture?â€\r\nTo assess the pathways toward safety culture, the current study has adopted an RSC-based questionnaire to which 180 survey responses from site professionals were obtained. A concurrent triangulation mixed method was used to analyze this data, supplemented with 16 interviews and field observations from 27 building construction projects in India. The \'contract value\' was used as a metric to aggregate the responses for three project types, i.e., \'small\', \'medium\', and \'large\'. Consequently, the current study first identified the significant differences in safety practices through a Resilience Engineering (RE) based analytical framework. Further, the current study uses Structural Equation Modelling to identify whether safety practices have a uniform effect on the dimensions of RSC, leading to uniform pathways for construction projects of different sizes. Whereas, to analyze the safety governance structure, the current study relies on Systems Theoretical Processes Analysis (STPA), a system-thinking-based approach proven effective in analyzing the stakeholders and their relationships in the construction sector. Analysis of existing Laws, Regulations, and Subject matter expertsâ€™ interviews were collected and synthesized for identifying the Safety Control Structure (SCS). Further, a generic analysis of SCS and a detailed analysis of each hierarchy-level actor were conducted to identify possible human and organizational errors.\r\nThe findings reveal that construction projects of different sizes have significant differences in their safety practices. However, unlike those reported in the previous literature, the results indicate that smaller projects do not consistently perform poorly than larger projects across safety practices. Moreover, the study reveals that the effect of similar safety practices in improving the RSC dimensions is not uniform across projects of different sizes. This finding contrasts with much of the existing literature that recommends emulating successful pathways from larger construction projects for smaller projects. The study results also provide novel implications for safety practitioners in identifying different strategic pathways for attaining RSC for projects of different sizes. Moreover, an understanding of the causes of a dysfunctional safety governance structure is provided by the STPA analysis, which highlights a gap in the feedback processes and relationships between the actors across different hierarchy levels. This could influence the norms of the organizations by slashing the safety practices necessary for minimum compliance, which would result in a degraded pathway toward RSC. Lastly, to strengthen the safety governance structure of the construction industry, the current study identifies likely organizational and human errors, which can help improve the intended critical roles and responsibilities of construction stakeholders, promoting better safety practices and consequently driving toward improved pathways toward resilient safety culture.\r\n','R.

The \r\nsteelmaking processes at the industry scale are very complex in nature and highly \r\ninhomogeneous and work under non-equilibrium conditions. A modeling approach has been \r\nemployed in this work by dividing the process regions into different zones, where highly mixed \r\nareas are considered in thermodynamic equilibrium and connected through the flow of streams \r\nwith each other. The model developed with such consideration employs a multi-zone reactor \r\napproach, considering thermochemical and kinetic factors to predict the liquid steel and slag \r\nphases\' temperature, composition, and volume. The study explicitly investigates decarburization \r\nrates and their contributions from various zones, including the hotspot generated by the jet \r\nimpact, the slag-metal-gas emulsion zone, and the bath boiling region. Modified kinetic \r\nparameters (represented as parameters inialpha, inibeta, and inigamma) were adjusted within \r\nappropriate ranges, using the hotspot temperature as a reference point, ranging from 2000 to \r\n3000Â°C, to assess the mixing levels in the metal bath. Remarkably, the current model aligns \r\nclosely with actual observations concerning carbon removal during the process. According to the \r\nmodel\'s findings, the most substantial contribution to decarburization predominantly occurs \r\nduring the initial phases of blowing, primarily driven by reactions in the hotspot. However, as the \r\nprocess progresses, it becomes increasingly influenced by the emulsion zone. This model \r\nprovides reasonable predictions for carbon removal rates under operating conditions in the steel \r\nindustry. The purpose of the current model was to understand decarburization phenomena in \r\nBOF converter. The model is also integrated with other sub-models like scarp, iron ore, flux \r\ndissolution, and heat loss models. Therefore, we also introduced additional sub-models for flux \r\ndissolution and heat loss calculations. The comprehensive model extends its predictive \r\ncapabilities to encompass decarburization, desiliconization, demanganization, and \r\ndephosphorization removal rates in impact (gas-metal) and emulsion (slag-metal-gas) zones \r\nunder real-world, full-scale operating conditions. Within the lime dissolution sub-model, the \r\ndissolution rate of flux is calculated, accounting for variations in slag viscosity, composition, and \r\ntemperature. This model\'s predictions for removing carbon, silicon, manganese, and phosphorus, \r\nas well as the temperature of the metal bath, agreed with actual observations from plant \r\noperations over the blowing process. The model is still progressing to incorporate other submodels like the scarp dissolution model. Therefore, the expanded model enhances its predictive \r\ncapacity by incorporating scrap dissolution dynamics. Analysis of the model\'s predictions reveals \r\na gradual melting of the scrap material within the initial phase (0-120 seconds), followed by a \r\nnotable acceleration in the subsequent stage (>120 seconds) attributed to the heightened \r\ntemperature of the liquid metal. Specifically, the scrap dissolution time was determined to be 510 \r\ns for a scrap radius of 0.25 m, 400 s for a radius of 0.18 m, and 300 s for a radius of 0.14 m. \r\nFurthermore, the model successfully forecasted that the metal bath temperatures were \r\nconsistently 60-85Â°C higher than the slag bath temperature during the middle part of the \r\nblowing; however, by the end of the blowing, it reverses, and the slag temperature is higher by \r\n40 to 60Â°C, demonstrating a remarkable agreement with the temperature measurements observed \r\nin the BOF converter.\r\nFinally, the model is a valuable tool for guiding plant operations, offering reasonable forecasts \r\nfor parameters such as carbon, silicon, manganese, and phosphorus removal rates, as well as slag \r\ncompositions and slag weights. The model includes sub-models for lime dissolution, scrap \r\ndissolution, and heat loss calculation. Scientifically, developing this comprehensive model for \r\nthe basic oxygen steelmaking process enhances our theoretical comprehension of the process. \r\nFurthermore, it offers the means to control the refining process when dealing with diverse raw \r\nmaterials and various operating conditions.','MME Office','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/tcw-xqkg-kan','','',1,'2024-05-10 05:34:18','Active'),(329,'seminar','Special Seminar','NULL','AS6999 Bioinspired fiber-reinforced polymer composites and their  mechanical properties  / AS7999 Three-point Bending, Interlaminar Shear, and Impact Strength in Bioinspired Helicoidal Basalt Fiber/Epoxy Composites: A Comparative  Experimental Analysis','Ms.Shreya Rai (AE20D405)','Ph D research Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','Dr.Prashant Rawat - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/05/10 15:00','2024-05-10','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/tzu-faya-jqg','','',1,'2024-05-10 05:45:12','Active'),(330,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','MKT1 allelic regulation of stress responses involves post-transcriptional modulation of Puf3 targets in budding yeast','Mr. Koppisetty Viswa Chaithanya (BT16D023)','Ph.D. Research Scholar, Department of Biotechnology','Guide: Dr Himanshu Sinha','Department of Biotechnology','2024/05/14 11:00','2024-05-14','','Google Meet','MKT1, a pleiotropic stress response gene identified by several quantitative trait studies, regulates HO endonuclease via the Pbp1-Pab1 complex post-transcriptionally. In addition, MKT1A89G polymorphism was identified to contribute differentially to stress resistance. MKT189G, as a causal variant, determined growth advantage in multiple environments and was hypothesised to regulate differential expression during stress conditions. RNA-binding protein Puf3 modulates a set of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial transcripts whose expression was found to be affected by the MKT1 alleles. This study attempted to correlate the MKT1 allele-derived growth advantage with the stability of Puf3 targets during stress and elucidated the roles of Pbp1 and Puf3 in this mechanism. We compared the mRNA decay kinetics of a set of Puf3 targets in multiple environments to understand the allele-specific regulation by MKT1. Our results indicated that variation in post-transcriptional regulation between MKT1 alleles caused this differential expression of Puf3 targets in a stress-specific manner. Additionally, MKT1 allelic interactions with Pbp1 and Puf3 were necessary to stabilise Puf3 targets, and this regulation was specific to the MKT189G background. Phenotypic analysis of these stress-specific Puf3 targets â€“ COX17, IVY1, and RDL2 showed that they selectively affect growth in MKT189G background in oxidative stress.

The rising concerns about pollution, caused by vehicular emissions, are being resolved by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). EVs are superior to internal combustion (IC) engine vehicles, which are fuelled by fossil fuels, in two important dimensions--fuel efficiency and exhaust emission. The heart of the EV is the energy storage system, and the popular choice is lithium-ion battery (LIB) due to high gravimetric energy density volumetric energy density, power density, good cyclability, high operating voltage, and low self-discharging compared to other rechargeable systems. EVs use different LIB variants that vary in LIB capacity, electrode and electrolyte raw material compositions, architecture, and form factors.  \r\nGovernment policy support (subsidies) for EV adoption, LIB manufacturing infrastructure, and raw material mining impacts LIB demand. However, gradual subsidy withdrawal, increasing pressure on geographical constraints, raw material supply chain complexity, and economic uncertainties due to increasing LIB demand inhibit LIB adoption. Additionally, geopolitical constraints, artisanal mining, limited manufacturing infrastructure, raw material price fluctuations, and the need for clarity in government policies impact the LIB demand. Supply pressure on raw material and LIB can be alleviated by adequately handling end-of-life (EOL) LIB that allows the recovery of raw material and the supply of repurposed LIB. \r\nThe above discussion points out that an in-depth understanding of the complexity of LIB demand is imperative to accelerate the electric mobility transition. Analysing the LIB demand variability and impact of EOL LIB handling processes requires a system-wide analysis rather than inspecting the individual components. The objective of this research is to develop a system dynamics model to understand the dynamics of LIB demand.  \r\nIn the first model, causal linkage among different subsystems of the LIB ecosystem, namely, raw material supply chain, manufacturing infrastructure, and EOL LIB management infrastructure and processes, is explored using system dynamics modelling. The model highlights the importance of government policies in analysing the LIB ecosystem. Government policy support helps in developing new raw material mines, battery R&D, LIB manufacturing, and EOL LIB handling process infrastructure. LIB demand depends on raw material mining, LIB cost, manufacturing infrastructure, EOL LIB handling process, LIB technological improvement, and different LIB variants demand. It is shown that LIB demand depends on interaction among multiple factors interlinked through multiloop feedback systems. We develop a system dynamics model to analyse the interrelationship between battery capacity (Battery OEMs), battery electrode composition (varies with different LIB variants), range anxiety (EV owners), subsidy (Government), and their effect on LIB cost (per kWh) and market demand. The results indicate that LIB cost per kWh attains the value between (99â€“135) USD/kWh in 2031-2032 depending upon the difference in scenarios. The results also highlight the trade-offs between the LIB cost and the LIB capacity while addressing the issue of range anxiety which helps battery product segmentation for consumers. LIB demand is substantially high in scenarios where higher subsidies are given on EV purchases in the initial phase and then gradually withdrawn during the simulation time frame. \r\nModel results also highlights that LIB variant demand variability impacts the EOL supply when LIB reaches EOL. Raw material demand and recovery depend on the LIB variants. System dynamics model is developed to address the complexity of the raw material recovery process by analysing the interrelationship between collection rate (government), LIB variant proportion in EOL LIB (consumer preference), and EOL LIB allocation to recycling and repurposing (Battery OEMs). Model results highlight recycling can reduce the demand for total raw material by 8-10%, reducing the virgin raw material for new batteries. Our analysis also reveals that a high EOL collection rate and recycling reduces the raw material (Nickel and Cobalt) demand by 2-17%. Hence, countries like India, with scarce strategic raw materials sources, framed policies that incentivized EOL LIB collection and recycling to alleviate raw materials scarcity.\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadra','','',1,'2024-05-10 07:05:23','Active'),(332,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Physics-informed Neural Networks for Heterogeneous Poroelastic Media','Mr. Sumanta Kumar Roy, Roll No. CE22S003','M.S Research Scholar','Dr. Chandrasekhar Annavarapu - Guide, Dr. Benny Raphael - GTC Member, Dr. Sundararajan Natarajan (ME) - GTC Member, Dr. Robinson R G - Chairperson','Civil Engineering','2024/05/16 14:30','2024-05-16','yes','BSB 104 (Conference Room)','Subsurface systems are inherently complex, with intricate coupling among various physical processes, often necessitating computational modeling due to the impracticality or expense of direct measurements. Traditionally, these coupled processes are represented mathematically through partial differential equations (PDEs) which are solved using mesh-based numerical methods like the finite element method. However, these mesh-based numerical methods require the generation of meshes that conform with the geometrically complex subsurface features. This pre-processing step is often non-trivial and comparable in its computational expense with the analysis phase. Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative to address this computational bottleneck. These methods construct a neural network approximation to the field variables by minimizing an objective functional been built from the residual of the governing PDEs, boundary conditions, and/or observed data. Although PINNs have demonstrated promise in several domains, their applications to model poroelasticity in heterogeneous media are limited because of two fundamental challenges. Firstly, sharp changes in material properties result in weakly discontinuous solutions, and PINNs are not naturally good at approximating such functions. Secondly, poroelasticity involves the solution of a coupled system of PDEs. This study addresses both of these challenges by proposing two novel architectures of PINNs: â€œInterface-PINNsâ€ (I-PINNs) for approximating discontinuous fields and a â€œcomposite neural networkâ€ (CNN) to solve coupled-field processes. These architectures are combined to model poroelasticity in layered heterogeneous media. Several benchmark examples are used to compare the performance of the proposed approach with conventional PINNs. The results show that the proposed method is better suited for heterogeneous poroelasticity problems in terms of both accuracy and cost. \r\n\r\n','R.

It involves partitioning a medical image (2D or 3D) into distinct regions and delineating structures such as organs, tissues, or anomalies, which can be done manually, semi-automatically, or fully-automatically. The primary objective is to enhance the precision of medical image interpretation, aiding clinicians in treatment planning and decision-making processes. Although many segmentation networks have been proposed for 3D volumetric segmentation of tumors and organs, they fail to produce precise results. In case of errors generated by these networks, clinicians would have to edit the generated segmentation maps manually. \r\nThis demands a methodology that can deal with the complexities arising from segmentation errors in medical imaging and a robust network to estimate these errors. To this end, we propose a novel methodology designed to identify and quantify inaccuracies within the segmentation map of a given 3D volume. By employing this approach, we can pinpoint and measure erroneous regions within the segmentation map, offering a comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, our method is capable of estimating errors at individual points or nodes within a 3D mesh generated from a potentially erroneous volumetric segmentation map. This approach serves as an effective Quality Assurance (QA) tool, enhancing the reliability and accuracy of segmentation outcomes in medical imaging applications.\r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/ecr-xgxx-bby ','','',1,'2024-05-10 10:11:07','Active'),(335,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','Cryptographic applications of k-SUM','Akhil Vanukuri (CS22S023)','Research Scholar,','Dr. Jayalal Sarma M.N, Dr. Shweta Agrawal, Dr.Aishwarya T., Dr. Nishanth Chandran','Department of Computer Science & Engineering','2024/05/15 11:00','2024-05-15','','Seminar Hall - (SSB 334 - AM Turing Hall)','In the average-case k-SUM problem, given r integers chosen uniformly at random from {0, . . . , M âˆ’ 1}, the objective is to find a â€œsolutionâ€ set of k numbers that sum to 0 modulo M.

This study explores two critical dimensions of sustainable business practices and their implications on firm value and entrepreneurial objectives in the context of evolving environmental regulations and climate technology startups. The overarching analysis juxtaposes regulatory impacts on established firms within the European Union against the developmental trajectories of climate tech startups in India, providing insights into how both macro-level policies and micro-level entrepreneurial activities influence sustainable business practices and financial outcomes.\r\n\r\nPart 1 of this study examines the impact of the EUâ€™s Corporate Social Responsibility mandate on listed European firms using a difference-in-differences regression model. Data from two years before and after the 2017 mandate, with prior-disclosure firms as controls, show that mandatory sustainability disclosures have limited impact on firm value, although inter-industry variations exist. This underscores the need to consider industry-specific metrics in policymaking. Part 2 of the study studies 15 Indian climate tech startups through a multiple case study, focusing on their evolving business models and objectives.

The idea behind introduction of cocktails of two different kind of materials is to enhance its optical properties by supporting electronic phenomenon. The integration of these two materials leverages the unique properties of each, resulting in enhanced performance and functionality. Metal oxide narrowband photodetectors in the visible region are in demand for different applications such as image sensors and bio-medical application. Earlier a metal oxide heterojunction consisting of zinc oxide (ZnO) and titanium oxide (TiO2) was fabricated with squaraine dye (SQ2) on top of the device. The device shows a significantly low dark current (1.72 nA under 10 V bias) with a detectivity of 2.57 Ã—1010 Jones (under 1 V external bias). In this work, A narrowband red-sensitive negative photodetector is fabricated on a TiO2/SnO2 heterojunction by a solution-processed technique. The negative photoconductance of the device originates from the TiO2/SnO2heterojunction and is converted into a narrowband red-sensitive photodetector by coating it with an organic dye, absorbing predominantly in the red portion of the visible spectrum. However, this negative red-sensitive photoresponse of the device can be converted to a positive photoresponse in a reversible manner by passing hot dry air. The negative photoconductance effect in the TiO2/SnO2 heterostructure is found to be persistent, whereas the positive photoconductance effect is characterized by its transient nature, indicating that the adsorbed H2O molecule on TiO2 has a key role in this negative photoconductivity. The photodetector exhibits a responsivity of 1.19 A/W and a detectivity of 6.0 Ã— 1011 Jones to red-light illumination (650 nm, 12.5 W/17 m2) in positive photoconductance mode. Moreover, the nature of the photoresponse in positive and negative photoconductance behaviour is quite different, which helps to identify the origin of the negative photoconductance of the device.','Parasuraman Swaminathan','swamnthn@iitm.ac.in','Offline seminar.

Training systems ranging from simple abdominal models (box trainers) to highly realistic virtual reality (VR) systems are used to train laparoscopic skills. Force is crucial for learning psychomotor skills in laparoscopic tissue manipulation. However, many laparoscopic VR simulators lack force feedback and measure tissue damage solely through visual feedback based on virtual collisions. Few VR simulators that provide force feedback have subjective force metrics. The widely used laparoscopic training program known as fundamental laparoscopic surgery (FLS) only measures time and position accuracy. Hence, to provide haptic skills training and assessment, we have developed a VR laparoscopic training simulator with haptic feedback. Additionally, we extend the FLS-part tasks to haptic-based FLS (HFLS), focusing on controlled force exertion. The proposed tasks are evaluated through face and content validity among laparoscopic surgeons of varying experience levels. The results show that trainees perform better in HFLS tasks, indicating the acceptance of the simulator for its appearance and functionality. Face and content validations show the need to improve haptic realism, which is also observed in existing simulators. To enhance the accuracy of force rendering, we incorporate a laparoscopic tool force model into the simulation. We further investigate the model\'s effectiveness through a psychophysical study that measures just noticeable differences (JND) for the laparoscopic gripping task. Additionally, we also propose an assessment of other laparoscopic surgical skills using Fittsâ€™s law, a method for measuring the speed and precision of hand movements. We focus specifically on the ability to adapt to the inverted visual tool motion caused by the fulcrum effect. Further, we investigate the impact of haptic feedback on inverted laparoscopic tool motion.','HOD Office','apoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkOnline Meeting link : https://meet.google.com/xda-ntpx-tkq','','',1,'2024-05-13 04:28:12','Active'),(340,'','Others',NULL,'Inaugural Wadhwani School of Data Science and AI (WSAI) Annual Research Showcase 2024',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'We are happy to invite you all to our upcoming event \\\'Inaugural Wadhwani School of Data Science and AI (WSAI) Annual Research Showcase 2024\\\' on 16th May 2024 at IIT Madras.

Photometric stereo-based cues guide the neural rendering of 3D meshes. Recent studies have shown that SDF-based neural implicit surface reconstruction methods can produce smoother, more comprehensive 3D reconstructions. However, their performance tends to decline when capturing fine details in complex near-field images due to the ambiguity in RGB reconstruction loss. For instance, 3D endoscopy, characterized by near-field sparse views and complex surfaces, poses considerable challenges for existing volumetric SDF methods. Motivated by advancements in near-field photometric stereo, our work explores the utilization of these cues to enhance neural implicit surface reconstruction from diverse perspectives. To simplify the acquisition of photometric stereo images in endoscopy setups, we employ a strategy that involves single-shot RGB photometric stereo capture for each view. Utilizing a learning-based near-field photometric stereo network, we extract depth and normals for each view. These cues contribute to improved performance when dealing with very near-field natural objects as well as endoscopic scenes. We have extensively tested this approach on various rendered and real near-field datasets, and it consistently outperforms existing photometric NeRF techniques, especially when dealing with near-field multi-view visuals.\r\n\r\n Our approach simplifies the capture process while maintaining high-quality results, crucial for near-field objects requiring precise detail.In our experiments, We seamlessly capture multiple viewpoints of various near-field real-time objects using a mobile device. Additionally, within our lab, we harness RGB-based rigid endoscopy setups to gather diverse perspectives.

The heat treated alloys were \r\ncharacterized in terms of difference of phase fraction, the extent of recovery, recrystallization \r\nand texture evolution. The effect of heat treatment parameters on the volume fraction and grain \r\nsize of primary Î± was more in bimodal microstructure than that of the equiaxed microstructure. \r\nThe width of transformed Î± laths increases with increasing soaking temperature. Additionally, \r\nthe extent of recovery and recrystallization of primary Î± was higher in equiaxed microstructure \r\nthan in bimodal microstructure. The higher solutionizing temperature caused the dislocations \r\nin primary Î± to arrange themselves into lower energy substructures, which ultimately lead to \r\nsub grain formation. In transformed Î± laths, dislocations were generated due to lattice strain \r\ninduced during Î² to Î± phase transformation. The rolling texture vanished gradually as the \r\nmicrostructure recovered and new recrystallized primary Î± grains grew. The newly formed \r\nrecrystallized primary Î± grains and the majority of transformed Î± showed a moderate and strong \r\nprismatic texture respectively.\r\nThe room temperature uniaxial tensile tests were conducted on all the microstructures. The \r\ndeformed specimens were characterized to elucidate the effect of various microstructural \r\nparameters on the tensile properties and to determine the deformation mechanism of the alloy. \r\nAmong three different microstructures, the equiaxed microstructure (Î±/Î²-900/950-FC) \r\nv\r\nexhibited a superior strength-toughness combination, while the lamellar microstructure (Î²1050-AC) displayed poor tensile properties. The bimodal microstructure (Î±/Î²-900/950-AC) \r\nshowed intermediate tensile properties. Recrystallized Î± grains and their connectivity promoted \r\nan extended steady-state flow during deformation and ductile fracture. The bimodal \r\nmicrostructure work hardened faster as compared to the other two microstructures. TEM \r\ninvestigation on the post-tested microstructures showed that events such as dislocation \r\nmultiplication and dislocation-dislocation interactions, formation of slip bands across the Î± \r\ngrains, and multiple slip and dislocation pile-ups contribute to hardening mechanisms during \r\ndeformation. Whereas slip transfer across Î±/Î± boundary and breaking of Î² laths are the events \r\nof softening mechanisms. The slip transfer across two adjacent Î± grains happens when the \r\nmisalignment between grains is less than 10Â°. Equiaxed microstructures exhibited maximum \r\nslip transfer due to interconnected primary Î± grains. Bimodal microstructures (Î±/Î²-900/950-\r\nAC) exhibited slip transfer when a higher fraction of interconnected primary Î± in the \r\nmicrostructure. In contrast, the lamellar microstructure showed no evidence of slip transfer. \r\nThe prism slip is the dominant active slip system in the equiaxed and bimodal microstructures. \r\nHowever, the lamellar microstructure with no primary Î± showed only the prismatic <c+a> and \r\npyramidal <a> slip activities.\r\nThe dynamic compression test at different temperatures (25, 300, and 450Â°C) and strain rates\r\n(10-3\r\n, 1, and 102\r\ns\r\n-1\r\n) were conducted for all three microstructures. The bimodal and lamellar \r\nmicrostructure have superior flow properties at higher temperatures and strain rates due to the \r\nabundance of Î±P / Î±T/Î² boundary and Î±T/Î² boundary. The severity of shear localization is higher \r\nin specimens tested at 300Â°C than those tested at 450Â°C due to higher thermal softening at \r\n450Â°C. A higher volume fraction of Î±T promotes prism <c+a> slip, whereas Î±P promotes prism \r\n<a> slip. Additionally, {1 0 1Ì… 0} slip is preferred over {1 1 2Ì… 0} slip at higher deformation \r\nvi\r\ntemperature and strain rates. Restricted grain rotation during deformation, because of due to the \r\ncolumnar morphology and imposed strain rate, has promoted pyramidal slip over prism slip. \r\nSever strain accumulation inside shear bands led to the formation of dislocations walls and \r\nlattice bending inside severely kinked lamellae and nano sub grains and dislocation networks \r\nand substructures inside elongated Î±P grains.\r\nAn in-depth investigation of shear bands and fracture surfaces led to very interesting outcomes. \r\nFormation of dendritic structure has been observed inside highly strained shear bands. \r\nFurthermore, the fracture surface of sheared samples exhibits spherical particles sticking to the \r\nsurface. Compositional analysis using EDS depicts these structures as close to the overall alloy \r\ncomposition with considerable solute segregation in spherical particles. The reason behind such \r\nobservation has been described as localized melting of the alloy due to a sudden burst of strain \r\nenergy during fracture and interface friction between delaminated grains. The temperature rise \r\ncalculated within the ASB, based on its fraction, predicts a temperature beyond the alloyâ€™s \r\nmelting point.','MME Office','mmoffice2@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkmeet.google.com/nir-rooh-irh','','',1,'2024-05-13 09:38:07','Active'),(344,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','SEMINAR II - Pharmaceuticals Removal and Disinfection from Aqueous System using Photocatalysis','Mr. DINKAR PARASHAR, Roll No: CE19D400','PH.D.Scholar','Dr.Mathava Kumar S  - Guide, Dr. Indumathi M Nambi -DC Member, Dr.Shiva Nagendra S M -DC Member, Dr.Smita Srivastava -DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/05/21 15:00','2024-05-21','yes','Google Meet','The increase in population and its growing health care needs have led to the presence of a wide variety of pharmaceuticals in the environment including aqueous systems. Among the pharmaceuticals, antibiotics are of major concern. The biological treatment-based wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) have been found to be insufficient in removing these pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the microbes moving out in the effluent of secondary treatment is expected to have the potential to carry AMR gene with them. Therefore, there is a need to remove these antibiotics and microbes after biological treatment operation in WWTP, so as to stop their discharge into the environment.\r\nPhotocatalysis is one of the promising advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in which electron and hole pairs are generated when light is incident on the surface of a semiconductor catalyst.

However, most of the solar light fraction comes as visible region and for practical applications, there is a need to modify the photocatalysts and study their applicability in visible and near visible region (UV-A). \r\nIn this seminar, literature review on antibiotics removal and bacteria disinfection using TiO2 and ZnO would be presented in the first part. Subsequently, the outcome of major antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline) degradation under visible and near visible region conditions using TiO2 and ZnO based catalysts will be discussed.

They typically involve allocating resources to disparate treatments which are under investigation. A cost-benefit analysis usually suggests how an experimenter should carry out this allocation to utilize resources effectively. This thesis investigates the complexities of developing a data-driven strategy for optimal resource allocation in non-standard online experimental environments. We use a Bayesian model where the factor effects have statistical priors, and the outcome is linearly related to these factors. The first study looks at the value of experimenting and can be applied to offline and online settings. We derive the probability distribution of the maximum expected benefit from exploring a design space. Given the potential advantages of conducting experiments, we address some associated challenges, including the impact of treatments, resources, and temporal variations. Extant literature proposes models that assume a standard multi-treatment framework for stationary experimental settings. The second study explores its inverse problem to model a non-standard online environment that fixes a single treatment and experiments in the space of heterogeneous resources. Maximizing the expected benefit from two phases -- one-shot exploration as the first phase followed by selective exploitation as the second phase -- we recommend the optimal allocation to each unique category of resources. The third study determines the effect of temporal variations on the treatments in a non-stationary online experiment. We assume a moving-window setup where choosing the better treatment among two alternatives at a particular time period depends only on the past few time periods. With continuous experimentation and exploitation of prior knowledge, maximization of the expected benefit leads to a steady state of resource allocation. We illustrate the applicability of the above studies with experimental data from the domain of financial technology and provide suggestions for implementation.','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','Ph.D. VIVA VOCE EXAMINATION.-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadr','','',1,'2024-05-13 10:52:53','Active'),(347,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','COMPUTATIONAL MODELLING AND ANALYSIS OF NONLINEAR VIBRATIONS OF SANDWICH PANELS','Ms.R.Sukanya (AE21D033)','PhD Scholar, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','Dr.K V Nagendra Gopal - Guide','Dept. of Aerospace Engineering','2024/05/15 15:00','2024-05-15','','Google Meet','','AE Office','aeoffice@iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkGoogle Meet : meet.google.com/sgh-xpmg-uay','','',1,'2024-05-13 11:10:16','Active'),(348,'seminar','Guest Lectures','NULL','Diffusion and search in complex media - examples from biology','Mithun Kumar Mitra','IIT Bombay','Department of Physics\r\nIIT Bombay','Center for soft and biological matter','2024/05/14 15:00','2024-05-14','','HSB 209','Transport and search processes are often crucial in biological systems.

Especially in Heavy Commercial Road Vehicles (HCRVs), the Government of India has taken steps to reduce road accidents by mandating Antilock Braking Systems (ABS). ABS is an AVSS that prevents wheels from getting locked during emergency braking and optimizes the braking force at the tire-road interface. However, during combined emergency braking and cornering, ABS alone may not ensure vehicle stability and may result in loss of directional stability. Hence, yaw rate control is necessary for critical cornering scenarios. This research evaluates an existing ABS algorithm in combined braking and cornering scenarios and presents the limitations of ABS in such situations. Further, it proposes a data-based reference yaw rate generator and rule-based yaw rate controller that modifies the reference value of the wheel slip given to the ABS. The integrated algorithm is evaluated on a hardware-in-loop setup with a brake actuator, which utilizes IPG TruckMaker to simulate vehicle dynamics. This research focuses on delivering a rule-based approach for yaw rate control that is commercially viable and can be the foundation for all use cases expecting directional stability and performance.

Moreover, the extraction of high-grade iron ore has resulted \r\nin the significant generation of slimes, ranging from 18% to 25%, during mechanized mining \r\nand crushing operations. These slimes, characterized by their small size (less than 0.15mm) \r\nand a high percentage of gangue oxides, cannot be utilized in blast furnaces due to their low \r\nFe value and high slag volume, adversely impacting productivity. As a result, slimes \r\naccumulate in tailing ponds within mining areas, posing substantial environmental hazards. In \r\nresponse to this challenge, the iron and steel industry\'s most viable solution is to utilize lowgrade tailings. This study aimed to elevate the grade of iron ore slime through a meticulous\r\ntwo-step process incorporating microwave-assisted reduction roasting and magnetic \r\nseparation, using the Taguchi statistical design for optimizing process variables. The \r\ninvestigation targeted the efficient utilization of low-grade iron ore slimes, specifically those \r\nbelow 76Âµm in size, by employing a comprehensive approach that included agglomeration into \r\npellets and subsequent magnetization roasting. Following reduction roasting, multi-pass lowintensity magnetic separation was used to treat the low-grade iron ore fines, characterized by \r\n44.53% Fe and 40.13% silica content. The outcomes of conventional reduction roasting, \r\nconducted at optimum conditions (800Â°C, 60 minutes, 7% coal), revealed a concentrate with \r\n52.78% Fe grade and 77.3% recovery. Notably, microwave roasting demonstrated superior \r\nperformance, yielding a higher concentrate grade of 53.06% Fe and a recovery rate of 75.7% \r\nat milder conditions (750Â°C, 2 minutes, 7% coal). Techno-economic analysis underscored the \r\nefficiency of microwave reduction, showcasing a 30-fold reduction in processing time and a \r\nsignificant fourfold decrease in energy consumption. The study concludes that employing \r\nmicrowave heating, followed by multi-pass magnetic separation, holds substantial promise for \r\nenhancing the economic viability of extracting valuable resources from lean iron ore ultra fines.\r\nExpanding the scope of the investigation, this study also explores the direct magnetization \r\nroasting of iron ore tailings slimes, bypassing conventional agglomeration and focusing on \r\nparticles below 0.15 mm.

Resulting in a magnetic concentrate \r\nboasting approximately 61.3% Fe and a recovery rate of around 72.6%, which is well-suited \r\nfor blast furnace feed grade. In contrast, conventional heating conditions of 850Â°C, 75Âµm, 8% \r\ncoal, and 40 minutes yield a magnetic concentrate with approximately 49.5% Fe and a recovery \r\nrate of about 70.9%.

Industrial plant data was used to validate the model. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to estimate the critical parameters of the process (like reaction factors and extent of reactions), to validate the model with industrial data. Furthermore, the model was utilized to analyze the process based on different parameters. Further investigation was conducted to assess the impact of replacing coke oven gas (COG) with bustle gas in the reducing gas. The results demonstrated the advantageous effects of increasing the fraction of retained CO and H2 in the exit gas when substituting COG with bustle gas, suggesting potential utilization in the MIDREX reformer.\r\n\r\nKey Words: MIDREX, Static model, COG, Metallization, DRI\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe present work developed a comprehensive thermochemical model that incorporates macroscopic mass and heat balance principles and considers the effect of various chemical reactions. Through this research, valuable insights can be gained to optimize and enhance the efficiency of thermochemical systems. The model facilitates the accurate prediction of process parameters for a given set of operating conditions. Additionally, it investigates the impact of altering process parameters, such as replacing the bustle gas with COG and varying the hydrogen content in the reducing gas. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a bio-inspired optimization technique based on natural evolution. Several workers had already used this technique to optimize the parameters of various ironmaking processes like blast furnaces, direct reduction processes, smelting reduction processes, and electric arc furnaces. The extent of various chemical reactions and their associated parameters were evaluated by the Genetic Algorithm approach (GA), where the sum of the square of the error between actual parameters and model parameters was minimized so that the model could become a true representative of the industrial process and it can be used as an effective guiding tool.

Moreover, the extraction of high-grade iron ore has resulted\r\nin the significant generation of slimes, ranging from 18% to 25%, during mechanized mining\r\nand crushing operations. These slimes, characterized by their small size (less than 0.15mm)\r\nand a high percentage of gangue oxides, cannot be utilized in blast furnaces due to their low\r\nFe value and high slag volume, adversely impacting productivity. As a result, slimes\r\naccumulate in tailing ponds within mining areas, posing substantial environmental hazards. In\r\nresponse to this challenge, the iron and steel industry\'s most viable solution is to utilize lowgrade tailings. This study aimed to elevate the grade of iron ore slime through a meticulous\r\ntwo-step process incorporating microwave-assisted reduction roasting and magnetic\r\nseparation, using the Taguchi statistical design for optimizing process variables. The\r\ninvestigation targeted the efficient utilization of low-grade iron ore slimes, specifically those\r\nbelow 76Âµm in size, by employing a comprehensive approach that included agglomeration into\r\npellets and subsequent magnetization roasting. Following reduction roasting, multi-pass lowintensity magnetic separation was used to treat the low-grade iron ore fines, characterized by\r\n44.53% Fe and 40.13% silica content. The outcomes of conventional reduction roasting,\r\nconducted at optimum conditions (800Â°C, 60 minutes, 7% coal), revealed a concentrate with\r\n52.78% Fe grade and 77.3% recovery. Notably, microwave roasting demonstrated superior\r\nperformance, yielding a higher concentrate grade of 53.06% Fe and a recovery rate of 75.7%\r\nat milder conditions (750Â°C, 2 minutes, 7% coal). Techno-economic analysis underscored the\r\nefficiency of microwave reduction, showcasing a 30-fold reduction in processing time and a\r\nsignificant fourfold decrease in energy consumption. The study concludes that employing\r\nmicrowave heating, followed by multi-pass magnetic separation, holds substantial promise for\r\nenhancing the economic viability of extracting valuable resources from lean iron ore ultra fines.\r\nExpanding the scope of the investigation, this study also explores the direct magnetization\r\nroasting of iron ore tailings slimes, bypassing conventional agglomeration and focusing on\r\nparticles below 0.15 mm. It meticulously examines diverse process parameters\' impact on\r\nmicrowave and conventional roasting, aiming to optimize efficiency and cost reduction.\r\nComparative analysis reveals the microwave\'s superiority, with optimal conditions including\r\n800Â°C, 105Âµm particle size, 8% coal, and 4 minutes. Resulting in a magnetic concentrate\r\nboasting approximately 61.3% Fe and a recovery rate of around 72.6%, which is well-suited\r\nfor blast furnace feed grade. In contrast, conventional heating conditions of 850Â°C, 75Âµm, 8%\r\ncoal, and 40 minutes yield a magnetic concentrate with approximately 49.5% Fe and a recovery\r\nrate of about 70.9%.

This shift marks a departure from reliance on human intelligence, as AI-driven approaches, especially deep learning algorithms, have proven to be highly effective in automatically localizing ships and tracking naval activities. In this context, a pioneering deep-learning-based algorithm has been developed specifically for ship localization in SAR images, addressing inherent complexities and computational demands. This algorithm integrates elements of traditional computer vision techniques with state-of-the-art deep neural networks, resulting in a robust framework for accurate ship localization. Moreover, a modified loss function has been introduced to optimize the model\'s performance, further enhancing its efficacy in detecting and localizing ships within SAR imagery. Comparative analysis of this novel algorithm against existing models has demonstrated significant improvements in both precision and recall metrics, showcasing its potential to substantially enhance coastal surveillance capabilities and bolster naval security efforts. The algorithm\'s ability to provide precise localization of ships in SAR images not only streamlines monitoring processes but also enables more proactive responses to potential maritime threats.\r\nBeyond ship localization, the study also delves into the realm of automatic maritime target classification using SAR data. By leveraging attention-guided convolutional neural network (CNN) models supplemented with handcrafted features, the research has achieved notable advancements in classification accuracy, particularly in low-resolution SAR images. This breakthrough holds immense promise for diverse maritime applications, including but not limited to vessel categorization (e.g., tankers, bulk carriers, container ships, fishing vessels), thereby contributing significantly to improved maritime domain awareness and operational efficiency. Furthermore, the study underscores the cost-effectiveness of utilizing SAR data for ship classification, especially when compared to high-resolution labeled SAR image data, which can be prohibitively expensive. This cost-efficient approach not only expands access to valuable maritime data but also paves the way for more comprehensive and accurate maritime surveillance systems, ultimately bolstering maritime security on a global scale.\r\n','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING ','oeoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-14 07:10:34','Active'),(354,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','Modeling and analysis of ocean heat contents in spatial and depth domains using satellite data','Mr.Vijay Prakash Kondeti (OE20D750)','Mr.Vijay Prakash Kondeti (OE20D750), PhD scholar ','Prof. P.

In-situ ocean temperature profiles are critical to estimate OHC changes despite some uncertainties due to specific instrument biases, baseline climatology, and spatial data distribution irregularity (mapping method). Insufficient and irregular observational data limit our ability to create synoptic views of OHC change and its long-term trends based on sparse observations. This has resulted in numerous satellite-based approaches for detecting spatial and temporal patterns of global and regional OHC changes from multi-sensor observations. Several researchers have proposed satellite-based OHC models for open oceans based on the Oceanâ€™s thermal expansion method (OTEM). Though OTEM is the finest choice, their implementations had significant drawbacks due to the deviation from precise theoretical considerations. The current study has attempted to better implement OTEM to estimate OHC at 17 depth extents ranging from the surface to 700 m. Artificial neural network (ANN) models are proposed to derive thermosteric sea level (TSL) from a given sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, geographical coordinates, and climatological TSL dataset. The model-derived TSL data can be used to estimate OHC changes based on the thermal expansion efficiency of heat. On the other hand, challenges still exist in estimating OHC changes in ice-covered oceanic regions, mainly because of insufficient data and a lack of satellite-based algorithms. For this, separate ANN models are proposed for estimating OHC changes at the same multiple depths in the ice-covered Arctic Ocean by establishing a relationship between OHC and sea ice thermodynamic parameters such as sea ice thickness, sea ice concentration, surface temperature, air temperature, and snow depth. The proposed models are capable of understanding spatial patterns and temporal trends of OHC in three-dimensional ocean space at desired time scales to better study global climate change and its impacts on the Polar Oceans.','DEPARTMENT OF OCEAN ENGINEERING ','oeoffice@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce link','','',1,'2024-05-14 07:18:55','Active'),(355,'seminar','Colloquium','NULL','Seminar II - Air Pollution Hotspot Management using Image Processing and Machine Learning Techniques','Mr. Aswin Giri J, Roll No: CE19D039','Ph.D. Scholar','Dr. S M Shiva Nagendra - Guide, Dr. Gitakrishnan Ramadurai - DC Member, Dr. Chandan Sarangi - DC Member, Dr. B S V Prasad Patnaik, AM - DC Member, Dr. Benny Raphael - Chairperson & Head CE','Department of Civil Engineering','2024/05/16 14:00','2024-05-16','yes','Visveswaraya Seminar Hall (BSB368) - Second Floor','Air pollution\'s sources and characteristics have become more complex in recent years, creating air pollution hotspots across the city. These micro-environments have high temporal and spatial variability, making the identification of such hotspots a challenge. The current monitoring methods are sparsely located and do not provide the high-resolution spatial data required to identify hotspots throughout the city. The recent developments in sensor technologies have tried to address this issue, albeit with some trade-offs. With massive potential for growth in new sensing methods, this study attempts to understand the effectiveness of using images for air quality sensing through machine learning.\r\nImages captured by cameras, smartphones and CCTV have become ubiquitous and are accessible to people of all demographics. Using images for air quality sensing could make air quality monitoring more accessible and air quality management more effective. This study evaluates the effectiveness of using images for air quality sensing and classification. We developed a dataset of outdoor images, particulate matter data, visibility data and meteorological data. We then used a deep learning technique called convolutional neural network to estimate the particulate matter concentration in the ambient air and classify the images. In addition, we combine the stationary, mobile, satellite and dispersion model data using machine learning-based data-fusion techniques to create a real-time hotspot map of the city.

LTB is associated with the formation of a tubercular granuloma that restricts the penetration of anti-TB drugs, including Rifampicin (RIF), to the infection site, thereby causing poor treatment outcomes. In this study, we developed Mtb-FTSZ-targeted silk fibroin nanoparticles that can penetrate the core of 3D granuloma and facilitate the antibacterial activity of RIF. A three-point dual-pharmacophore based in silico virtual screening and in vitro biochemical studies identified Piperine (PIP, IC50=21.2Â±0.7â€¯Î¼M), Bromo-dimethoxy coumarin and diethyl amino-methyl-coumarin as potent Mtb-FTSZ targeting agents. PIP was chosen as a suitable candidate ligand for  Mtb-FTSZ targeting due to its low cytotoxicity and potential synergistic antibacterial activity (MIC90=56.0 Â±4.3Î¼M). RIF-encapsulated silk fibroin nanoparticles (R-SFNs, 168Â±31nm) were synthesized by pH-mediated self-assembly. The R-SFNs exhibited an immunomodulatory effect on macrophages and demonstrated an enhanced intracellular antibacterial clearance in a 2D macrophage infection model. These R-SFNs were functionalized with PIP (P-R-SFNs), and the intragranuloma trafficking of P-R-SFNs was studied using an in-house developed human iPSCs derived 3D in vitro granuloma model. It was observed that the P-SFNs exhibit enhanced granuloma penetration kinetics with two-fold higher accumulation within the granuloma spheroids than the naÃ¯ve SFNs. Notably, the P-SFNs could penetrate the caseous core of TB granuloma, while the naÃ¯ve SFNs were retained at the periphery. Further mechanistic studies revealed that PIP functionalization improved the membrane fluidity of macrophages, thereby enabling improved penetration of P-R-SFNs. Thus, the study culminates Mtb-FTSZ targeting and passive permeability potentiation of piperine, combined with the good aerodynamic, immunomodulatory, and mucoadhesive nature of SFNs, can be a potential drug delivery system for treating granuloma-associated tuberculosis.\r\nPublications from the thesis:\r\n1.

This pursuit faces a significant hurdle: maintaining diffraction-limited beam quality amidst thermal fluctuations and optical non-linearities in the gain medium, particularly when targeting power levels in the order of 100 kWs from a single emitter. Coherent Beam Combining (CBC) emerges as a transformative solution, offering a pathway to enhance output power efficiency while preserving beam quality. Unlike conventional incoherent beam combining, which linearly scales beam intensities, CBC leverages the intricate combination of beam fields, resulting in a remarkable quadratic scaling of intensity with the number of beams.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of CBC\'s effectiveness lies the challenge of implementing active phase control. The coherent combination of the optical beams is fraught with perturbations from various factors, impeding their ability to coherently interfere and compromising combining efficiency. Dynamic phase control emerges as a crucial strategy, enabling real-time compensation for phase fluctuations and thereby enhancing combining efficiency. The seminar initially delves into modeling and simulation of phase control using conventional Stochastic Parallel Gradient Descent (SPGD) for a Tiled Aperture CBC system. It further develops an adaptive SPGD version, showcasing improved performance with increasing channel numbers. Subsequently, practical implementations of these algorithms within an experimental setup provide valuable insights into real-world performance and applicability. Lastly, the thesis explores Reinforcement Learning (RL) as an alternative to SPGD for phase control optimization, aiming to address challenges of phase noise, scalability, and efficiency in CBC systems and foster more robust and adaptable control strategies. \r\n','EE HoD Office','eeoffice@ee.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/nsd-mmnv-uxa','','',1,'2024-05-14 10:58:31','Active'),(363,'seminar','Viva Voce','NULL','ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION OF AUDIO-VISUAL STIMULI INDUCED AROUSAL AND VALENCE EMOTIONAL STATES USING EEG SIGNAL','Mr. Himanshu Kumar (AM18D027)','Ph.D Scholar, Dept.of Applied Mechanics and Biomedical Engineering','Guide: Prof. S.

Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a prominent physiological signal for this purpose, measuring brain activity non-invasively. However, extracting reliable information from EEG signals during evoked emotions, particularly using audio-visual stimuli, presents challenges. The convergence of multiple sensory inputs introduces nonlinearity and nonstationarity in signal characteristics. Moreover, existing automated classification methods lack transparency and may not be fully comprehensible. The aim of this research is to characterize arousal and valence emotional states using EEG signals. The discrete channel and functional connectivity of EEG signals under evoked emotional states are analyzed using linear and non-linear signal processing techniques.

This observation is generally attributed to the transient effects associated with stress relaxation phenomenon that occurs during the dwelling period. Therefore, accurate prediction of the time dependent mechanical behaviour during relaxation is important to model interrupted deformation processes. Although there have been several attempts to model relaxation, physically based constitutive formulations that can account for the deformation mechanism are scarce in the literature. So in this work, a modified version of the Kocksâ€“Meckingâ€“Estrin (KME) dislocation density based model is used to evaluate the substructural changes during relaxation. The model is implemented in the commercial finite element software ABAQUS through user material (UMAT) subroutine. Iso-error maps are generated to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical integration algorithm used. Simulations of interrupted uniaxial tensile tests for an aluminium alloy under two different material conditions are carried out to validate the model against experimental results. The implemented model is shown to closely capture the drop in stress and account for changes in dislocation density during relaxation. Subsequently, the model is applied to simulate interrupted hole expansion tests (HET). Through suitable conjectures, the effect of relaxation on the improvement in the hole expansion ratio is demonstrated.\r\n','Ganesan A / J Baskar','officeme@zmail.iitm.ac.in','-web confernce linkhttps://meet.google.com/uai-jvvw-qus','','',1,'2024-05-14 14:32:18','Active'),(365,'seminar','MS Seminar','NULL','\'\'MULTI-OBJECTIVE VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEM WITH TIME WINDOWS (LARGE SCALE IMPLEMENTATION) \'\'.','K.

Many e-commerce companies has their main focus in routing vehicles as it forms the core problem to crack in their business models. As customers widely shift towards the e-commerce platforms, the need to solve the problem on a larger scale is also required. Every company has their own business model with different objectives. Companies like bbnow, zepto, swiggy, zomato etc., service the customers as soon as possible whereas companies like big basket have a specific slot for each delivery and companies like flipkart and amazon deliver the goods anytime within a specific day. Each company have their own routing model where they concentrate on a specific objective like delivering the goods to the customer on time or reducing the operational cost etc. In a real-time scenario it is essential to consider different objectives like cost, distance, customer satisfaction etc. Hence solving a problem with multiple objectives becomes essential. Among many objectives, customer satisfaction plays a significant role in a companyâ€™s success thus delivering the goods on time becomes one of the major objectives to be concentrated. This motivates our work where we deal with Multi Objective VRP with Time Windows. \r\nIn study 1, we frame a model to solve Multi-Objective Single Depot Vehicle Routing Problem with semi-soft time windows (MO-SDVRPSSTW) using a lexicographic approach. The primary objective of the problem is to minimize the number of customer orders that are tardy and use series of other objectives viz., the total distance travelled, the total tardiness and number of vehicles with their waiting times to bring in business context to solve very large problems. A mathematical formulation of the problem is presented, and an efficient Lexicographic Variable Neighborhood Search Algorithm (LVNSA) has been developed that iteratively uses the objectives in a lexicographic manner to generate good and better solutions on smaller benchmark problems and very large instances with 10000s of customers from real-life case data. A comparative evaluation from a practical sense is demonstrated with business implications.\r\nIn study 2, we present a Multi-Objective Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problems with Hard Time Windows (MO-MDVRPHTW) with the objective of minimizing the total distance and total number of vehicles for very large-scale data sets reflecting real-life applications. The proposed approach uses a decomposition-based framework that involves grouping of customers, initializing routing definitions using the sweep algorithm and generating better improvements on the routing sequences using Very Large-Scale Neighborhood (VLSN) search algorithm. The performance of the algorithm has been tested on 20 benchmark problems for Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows (MDVRPTW). Subsequently further experiments have been designed to generate very large-scale data sets to evaluate the scalability and the performance as well as robustness of the solutions using travel time uncertainty.\r\nIn certain real-life applications, there exists a restriction on the duration of the vehicle in a particular day. In this study we also analyze the impact on the quality of the solution including and excluding the maximum route duration limit for vehicles.\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS	Vehicle Routing, Soft Time Window, Hard Time Window, Multi-Objective, Large Neighborhood Search\r\n\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','MS SEMINAR-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-iitmadras/j.php?MTID=mf02','','',1,'2024-05-15 04:03:01','Active'),(366,'seminar','Research Scholar Seminars','NULL','â€œDEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A FRAMEWORK TO DETERMINE THE DIMENSIONS OF SOCIAL TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINSâ€.','Ms. PREETHI .R, Roll no.

Despite the three pillars of sustainability â€“ environmental, social, and economic- the limited and scattered analysis is on the social part, and the least is on socially responsible supply chain management (SR-SCM). SCT plays a significant role in elevating the sustainability of the supply chain. This study emphasizes the integration of SCT and sustainable supply chain, especially the social aspect as SR-SCM, and coining the new term social transparency (ST). This study establishes a conceptual framework using three research methods: systematic literature review, content analysis-based literature review, and framework development. The framework proposes five dimensions: tracking and tracing suppliers till provenance, product and process specifications, financial transaction information, social sustainability policies and compliance, and performance assessment to determine ST in global supply chains. \r\n\r\nWe further provide empirical evidence from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders across industries in the supply chain and validate the determinants. The ultimate goal is to build a robust research framework that will be crucial in evaluating social transparency, thereby contributing significantly to supply chain management and sustainability. This analysis reveals a fascinating diversity of perspectives among stakeholders (manufacturers, suppliers, social auditors, and consumers) across the supply chain. They perceive the necessity of social transparency and sustainability differently across industries such as food, textile, leather, and automotive.\r\n\r\n\r\n','DOMS OFFICE','doms@iitm.ac.in','SEMINAR - II (RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM)-web confernce linkhttps://doms-mba-iitmadras.webex.com/doms-mba-i','','',1,'2024-05-15 04:15:00','Active'),(367,'seminar','Research Proposal Seminars','NULL','2D VSe2 thin films and VSe2/MX2 heterostructures','Ms. VIKASMITA SAMANTA, (PH21D006)','PhD Scholar, Department of Physics, IIT Madras','Guide: Dr. Sudakar Chandran','Department of Physics, IIT Madras','2024/05/24 15:00','2024-05-24','yes','HSB-210, S N BOSE HALL, Department of Physics ','Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted significant research attention in various applications, viz. electronics, spintronics, memory devices and energy-related fields. Controlling their structure and properties to realize intrinsic ferromagnetic metallic nature is challenging. VSe2 stands out as one of the promising TMD due its distinct physical and chemical properties including high electrical conductivity [1], presence of charge density wave (CDW) [2], and its ferromagnetic (FM) nature within 2D limit than its bulk counterpart [3]. However, discrepancies in the FM nature [4] and suppression of CDW ordering at reduced dimensionality [1] motivate further exploration. Also, synthesizing continuous large-area 2D VSe2 thin films has been challenging. Furthermore, the heterostructures of VSe2 need to be explored to tailor and control the physical properties [5]. In this talk, I will give a comprehensive review on VSe2 thin films and its properties. Heterostructures derived from VSe2 thin films will also be discussed. Subsequently, I will present preliminary work that I have conducted on VSe2 thin films grown by CVD process. Finally, the future research plans to enhance the magnetic properties, tailor the electrical conductivity and to explore the 2D VSe2/MX2 heterostructures, specifically for spintronics application will be presented.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1]	Y.

I have mainly implemented agent-based models to study the dynamics of SPPs. Besides exotic pattern formations, orientational order-disorder phase transitions are observed with the variation of an appropriate system variable. Though the transition nature depends on the values of system parameters, the properties exhibited at the transition are characterized.
